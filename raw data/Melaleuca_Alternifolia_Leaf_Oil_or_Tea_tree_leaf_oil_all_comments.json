I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out üôÉ)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench ‚Äì 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details.

EDIT: It's also available for 20,000 KRW on Coupang for those who live in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients from [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d77e425390.html)\n\n>water, propanediol, cetyl ethylhexanoate, squalane, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), gylcerin, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Glyceryl stearate citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 stearate, Hydroxyethyl acrylate / sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, butylene glycol, acrylates / c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, gylceryl caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Sorbitan isostearate, Asiatic acid, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Tocopherol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't used the Water Sleeping Mask before, but I've read mixed reviews on it and I'm curious how the two products will compare. The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I‚Äôm allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ‚òπ (I can‚Äôt believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don‚Äôt even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I‚Äôve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it‚Äôs bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I‚Äôve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** ‚Äì I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** ‚Äì This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** ‚Äì This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels ‚Äúsilky‚Äù on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that‚Äôs why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that‚Äôs how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** ‚Äì I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven‚Äôt noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong ‚Äúpine-like‚Äù smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** ‚Äì This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** ‚Äì I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I‚Äôve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I‚Äôm still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven‚Äôt used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** ‚Äì These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Beauty Treats face masks** ‚Äì I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there‚Äôs not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar ‚Äì all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** ‚Äì I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** ‚Äì This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** ‚Äì I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don‚Äôt think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** ‚Äì I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** ‚Äì I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don‚Äôt even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** ‚Äì This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I‚Äôm guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn‚Äôt work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** ‚Äì This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don‚Äôt like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don‚Äôt mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** ‚Äì This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too ‚Äúperfumey‚Äù and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** ‚Äì Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** ‚Äì This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a ‚Äúcream‚Äù consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt ‚Äúcool‚Äù on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** ‚Äì This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don‚Äôt need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. ‚ÄúMy face loves ceramides, so it can‚Äôt be this!‚Äù Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** ‚Äì I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won‚Äôt like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I‚Äôm going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot ‚Äì sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My ‚Äúcold‚Äù also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ‚òπ\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don‚Äôt usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won‚Äôt try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** ‚Äì I thought I‚Äôd give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** ‚Äì It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** ‚Äì This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven‚Äôt tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** ‚Äì I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** ‚Äì I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can‚Äôt wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** ‚Äì 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven‚Äôt used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I‚Äôm all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** ‚Äì I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** ‚Äì This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n‚Ä¢\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** ‚Äì Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

    "body": "**To celebrate the end of the year, here are the top 5 products in every category from nationally recognized Korean skincare and beauty app, Hwahae.** \n\nClick [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/k8vtfl/review_hwahaes_top_5_cleansing_oils/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) for Top 5 Cleansing Oils. \n\n*First, what is Hwahae?*\n- Hwahae (ÌôîÌï¥) is The App for skincare and beauty product reviews in Korea. It was launched in 2013, and has been the go-to ever since. The rankings are all submitted by real users, and brands will often take pride in their products that are reviewed/ranked favourably with a recognizable sticker on the products, similar to what Allure assigns its best products. \n\n*Cleansers - Gel*\n- Gel cleansers are a great secondary cleanser to follow up the oil for the best, thorough clean. This category does not include: water, foam, or lotions. \n\n1. **Dr. G pH Cleansing Gel Foam** \n- Brand Quirk: Dr. G is comparable to Dr. Jart, in that they are both ‚Äúskin mentors‚Äù, and created by Korean dermatologists. \n- Price: 200ml/22,000W = 25.96 CAD\n- Reviews: 4.24/5,1.4K+\n- [CosDNA Ingredient Report](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_18c0539428.html)\n- *Those with sensitive skin should be aware that this product contains lavender oil, though some remark it has a slight, ‚Äúdish detergent-esque‚Äù scent.*\n\n**2. S.Nature Blanche All-in-One Cleanser**\n- Brand Quirk: Their products are especially catered to those with dry and/or sensitive skin, so ideal for those that suffer from conditions such as rosacea.  \n- Price: 260ml/28,000 = $33.05 CAD\n- Reviews: 4.34/5, 1K+\n- [Incidecoder Ingredient Report](https://incidecoder.com/products/s-nature-blanche-cleanser)\n- *Although good for sensitive and dry skin, it is a lighter product that, despite its name, would not be ideal to use by itself (for makeup removing purposes)*\n\n**3. CosRX LowpH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**\n- Brand Quirk: They are one of the most recognizable brands in foreign (non-Korea) countries, so their products are very accessible in comparison. \n- Price: 150ml/9,900W = $11.68 CAD\n- Reviews: 4.07/5, 1.7K+\n- [CosDNA Ingredient Report](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f651535115.html) \n- *This is not recommended for those with sensitive skin due to the presence of citric acid and tea tree leaf oil. From personal experience, my dry skin thought this was too stripping, though in theory the ingredients should be compatible.*\n\n**4. HYGGEE pH Hyaluron Gel Cleanser**\n- Brand Quirk: This brand prides itself on essential, minimalist formulations with no additives. \n- Price: 200ml/23,000W = $27.14 CAD\n- Reviews: 4.32/5, 634\n- [Incidecoder Ingredient Report](https://incidecoder.com/products/hyggee-ph-hyaluron-gel-cleanser)\n- *Those with dry skin should do well with this product, due to the presence of various moisturizing ingredients, including sodium hyaluronate.*\n\n**5. ATRUE Sweet Song Black Tea Energy Cleansing Gel**\n- Brand Quirk: Their products contain black tea water ~from France~, and are marketed towards those looking for anti-aging products. They are cruelty-free. \n- Price: 250ml/19,000W = $22.42 CAD\n- Reviews: 4.30/5, 353\n- [CosDNA Ingredient Report](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_83b8449193.html)\n- *This is recommended for those with oily or sensitive skin due to the presence of camellia leaf water, licorice root extract, and soybean extracts.*",

Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again.

Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this!

HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (¬∞C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 ¬∞C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1. Mix Salicylic Acid with Propylene Glycol until it is completely dissolved;\n2. Add Sodium Hydroxide solution and water;\n3. Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n4. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

[TaraLee: DIY Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant](https://youtu.be/LIubTz7QIW8) \\- too little of solvents, too high pH (because lower pH will lead to more free acid and recrystallization due to lack of solvents).\n4. [Cosmateur: DIY Salicylic Acid 2% Serum | 4 ingredients](https://youtu.be/RFBUwxkrkaU) \\- although the amount of solvents seems right, the formula is written in volumes, which means SA content is higher than 2% allowed (ethanol is lighter than water). Also, part of the ethanol evaporates during extensive mixing, so the concentration gets even higher. Moreover, the pH is not adjusted at all.\n\n# Community formulas\n\n* [Cleansing pads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/vywxmu/super_simple_salicylic_acid_cleansing_pads/)\n* [Paula's Choice dupe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/jav3qq/i_made_a_2_salicylic_acid_toner_loosely_based_on/)",

        "body": "A great comprehensive view! I have a few comments/corrections/additions. Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water,¬†**Ethanol**,¬†*Salicylic Acid*,¬†**Propylene Glycol**,¬†**Betaine**,¬†**Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,¬†**Polysorbate 20**,¬†**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1.

Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\nBetaine (also called N,N,N-trimethylglycine) isn't a pH adjuster because it's largely zwitterionic in solution, and has a pKa of around 2.33, and so won't be appreciably protonated (i.e. taking up protons to buffer the solution) until after you've protonated a >50% of the salicylic acid. However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information!

come out with some [Disney Collab Cleansers](https://dtimes.jp/tokiwayakuhin-disney-design-nameraka-honpo/) on July 7th.\n\n\n*Lalavesi* has a new *AKMA* cream [Pink Cica](http://www.lalavesi.com/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=301293&xcode=003&mcode=003&scode=002&type=Y&sort=manual&cur_code=003003&GfDT=bG93WA%3D%3D).\n\n\nI really like the packaging of [Eye Crown's](http://eye-crown.com/index.html) mascaras and I think it's awesome that they came with a cape and lash comb(the crown).The brand from what I've seen is pretty new like their fb and twitter posts start in like may of this year.\n\n\nI know these have been out for a long time now but I only recently came across them. *L'Herbiflore* [Home Of The Mermaid](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=11) and [Fashion Traveler](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=1&classid=23) mask collections really caught my eye recently.The mermaid series has ingredients such as algae(green,red),pearl,deep ocean water,marine collagen and the fashion one has ingredients such as lupine, vit A,shea butter, arbutin, tranexamic acid,mulberry,olive,royal jelly,iris,mushroom.\n\n\n[Cosme Recipe](https://cosmerecipe.tokyo/) has two all over gels(body,face,hair) that look nice.The *Aloe+Lemon* has ingredients such as  Hydrolyzed Avocado Protein, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lemon Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Ceramide NP, Tea Tree Leaf Oil and the *Grapefruit+Cucumber* has ingredients such as Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Royal Jelly Extract, Grapefruit Fruit Extract, Cucumber Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Ceramide NP, Kale Leaf Extract.\n\n\n\n*DNACLAIR* has a nice looking mosturizer [Premium Cream](http://dgmp.jp/ec/products/detail.html?id=72).It has ingredients such as squalane, shea butter, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide AP, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, hydrolyzed collagen, succinoyle atelocollagen, phytosphingosine, hydrolyzed elastin, placenta extract, sodium hyaluronate, soluble proteoglycan, mortierella oil, trifluoroacetyl tripeptide-2, oligopeptide-68, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, cerebrosides, oligopeptide-24, acetyl decapeptide-3, palmitoyl

Neosolue‚Ñ¢-Aqulio.\n\n\n*&fute'le* has a stick cheek & lip tint that has some cute shades called [Watery W Tint](https://www.andfutele.com).\n\n\n*Shimizu* is a brand that I recently came across and if you are a fan of placenta they are def worth a look.From what I've seen the majority of their products are fragrance free and don't have any EO or fragrant plant extracts(their anti-aging line(the with brown packaging) does have some flower and citrus extracts)). They products have ingredients such as placenta extract, ubiquinone,dif froms of HA, ceramides, hydrolyzed collagen, royal jelly extract, phytosphingosine,  Neosolue‚Ñ¢-Aqulio, retinyl palmitate, tripeptide F, oil soluble licorice extract, ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate,etc.\n\n\n\nAlso I checked this out yesterday for someone  and even thought they made a post about it afterwards in case you guys haven't seen it the Rosette Ceramide Gel has been discontinued.According to [cosme](http://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/289770/top) - \"This product has ended production or renewal. (However, some stores may still be on sale.)\" . From what I could get from some comments the gel has stopped production this april while the lotions from the line have stopped been produced since last fall.The entire Ceramide line is gone from the lineup on the Rosette's site.",

He posted a pic of their flashy labels, and thus being a sucker for such things, I bit.\n\nThe 4 oz. soap was $11.99; the 4 oz. splash was 11.99; standard USPS shipping was 4.95.  I placed my order on Saturday, February 11.  I received a shipping confirmation the following Monday, and the package arrived at my home in East Texas via USPS the following Friday, February 17.  The products arrived in a generic cardboard box and were securely packed in packing peanuts.  Both the soap and the splash's lids were secured with perforated break-away seals.  Included as a throw-in was a silicone soap dish.  More on the soap dish later.\n\nSince the lure was the packaging, I'll start there.  The labels *do* look as good in person as they do on their site.  They're bright and colorful even if they're a little busy.  The side label is welcomed and legibly denotes the product name as well as the logo and ingredients list (*ingredients list for soap and splash can be found at the end of this review*).  The side label is not perfectly centered, and one corner is abraded as if someone attempted to peel and re-try.  The top label is perfectly placed and without blemish.  The labels are, in fact, water-proof with a shiny luster.  I also note both the product name and company logo on the top label are slightly raised and have a different texture from the rest of the label giving the impression of a very thin decal, when in reality it's probably just a printing technique.  This overlay effect causes the logo and product name to stand out from the back ground.  It's a very professional job.\n\nThe plastic jar is frosted and double-walled with an internal diameter of 81 mm.  It's 44 mm high without the lid and 47 mm with the lid. The opaque black lid is recessed with ribbed sides and has some flex and thus is not brittle. If my research pans out, the jar appears to be [Olcott Plastics model JDSF0489PP](http://www.olcottplastics.com/products/4oz-89mm-double-wall-straight-side-frosted/).  The soap filled the jar to approximately 1 cm below the top.\n\nThe splash bottle is crystal clear and stands 108 mm high with the lid.  It's 53 mm wide and 32 mm deep.  The screw-top lid is black and ribbed.  It has separate front and back labels done in the same style as the matching soap.  The label execution is not quite as professional as that of the soap.  The labels are slightly crooked, and the front one is off-center.  The corners of said labels are also peeling.  Again, the peeling does not appear to be non-adhesion, but rather a failed attempt to remove the label.  It's a comparatively small detraction.  The flow limiter is effective allowing you to control pour the thin product into your palm without having to shake it out.\n\nThe dry consistency of the soap is that of a typical croap on the firmer end of the spectrum with an off-white even color.  The scent off the dry puck is a pleasant, clean, gentle, slightly powdery citrus with a hint of earth.  I loaded with the outstanding 30 mm Tuxedo knot courtesy of APShaveCo.  With a slightly damp knot, the soap loaded easily.  As per my usual technique, I aggressively loaded for about 45 seconds to accommodate for a 3-pass head and face shave.  There was only a minimal amount of wasted proto-lather as the usable product pulled into the knot.  I quickly dipped the tips into my reserve water and began face lathering.  The initial distribution was much thinner than I'd expected, but it very quickly expanded into a thick pillowy lather.  After switching to paint strokes, the lather transformed into the desired manageable dense substrate most of us prefer.  Meanwhile, the knot had doubled in size.\n\nThe protection was excellent and glide was on par with most of my other preferred artisan soaps.  Freshly shorn areas maintained some slickness, but nothing approaching that of the elite artisans.  Reconstituting with a wet palm didn't change this. It doesn't change the quality of the shave, but one would probably want to avoid touch-ups without visible lather.\n\nThe lathered fragrance of El Barbero is about the same as the off-the-puck scent.  It's somewhat uninspired, but I probably shouldn't have high expectations having ordered their \"Barber Shop\" scent.  They claim a \"Miami feel\" twist to the traditional barber shop, but I don't feel it.  It's pleasant, for sure, but it doesn't stand out among other artisans' citrus/earth/powder barber shop offerings.  The scent strength is bold enough for me, but others may prefer a little more punch.  I would call it a 3.5 out of 5.\n\nAfter the shave, as part of my unprofessional method of testing, I smeared the pulled lather onto my head and face while I cleaned up the gear. I noticed no ill-effects or warmth or tingling.  After rinsing, my skin felt very soft, supple, and moisturized such that a post product is not essential even for my sensitive skin.\n\nThe aftershave splash felt great with just enough glycerin to facilitate distribution.  Despite the inclusion of aloe, I did not detect any tackiness.  Interestingly, as I review the ingredients, I see the inclusion of \"menthol crystals\".  I honestly do not recall any cooling sensation other than what I'd expect from any room temp liquid applied to my warm skin.  The splash's fragrance is a good match for the soap, and it may be a bit more citrus-forward.  About an hour later I detected a healthy amount of earthiness with hints of oakmoss, and the previously non-descript citrus became more specific to bergamot.  I can't speak to the staying-power of the fragrance because I fell asleep about 4 hours after the shave.  However, it did last at least that long.\n\nA 3-pass head and face shave went quickly, and it was an overall pleasant shave.  The performance is one that most of us will be happy to revisit and keep in our ever-growing rotations.  As a first impression, I feel like Lather Bros., while not topping out the field of elite artisans, it is certainly better than average.  They're already far ahead of the curve with regard to packaging, and the performance, with only a little tweaking, could easily hold its own with the top-notch artisans.\n\nOther than being based in Miami Lakes, Florida, I know nothing else about the artisan/company.  The \"about\" section on the website is incomplete.  They are on twitter and Instagram.  I have sent an inquiry via their site asking for a bio, but as of this writing, I've not heard back. EDIT:  Found more info on the artisans: https://www.instagram.com/p/BM1fYGhgsH3/\n\nIn addition to shaving soaps and aftershaves, Lather Bros. also makes tallow bath bars and non-tallow \"shampoo\" bars.  They offer a free silicone soap dish for signing up for their newsletter.  I did not sign up, but a soap dish was included in my order.  It's a pretty nice flexible silicone dish. It has replaced my rubber shelf-liner on which I place my razor while shower shaving.\n\n**Shaving Soap Ingredients**: *Stearic Acid, Coconut Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Guava Puree, Tallow, Coconut Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Lactate Essential Oils and Fragrance*\n\n**Aftershave Splash Ingredients**:  *Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Witch Hazel Water, Phenoxyethanol, Organic White Willow Bark Extract, Menthol Crystals, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Organic Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Essential Oils and Fragrance oils*",

Ingredients in this conditioner, I'll list some below...\n\n\nWater, behentimonium methosulfate (Does this count as a sulfate....), Cetearyl Alcohol (I heard alcohols were bad too, does anyone suggest an alternate?), tea tree leaf oil, peppermint oil, white ginger (and lot more I would rather not type out on my phone lol)",

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don‚Äôt have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I‚Äôm feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It‚Äôs something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol!¬†\n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn‚Äôt mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don‚Äôt have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn‚Äôt anything that my hydrating toner couldn‚Äôt pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn‚Äôt hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn‚Äôt love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more ‚Äúneutral‚Äù for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my ‚Äújourney‚Äù into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see‚Ä¶\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xypq1scchd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff62380bf82fb4b8781bfefbabc9d865e7e84d48",

    "body": "AFAIK there are not many research papers that tested climbazole on malassezia, but the ones available show really, really good results (similar like Ketoconazol, what is in Nizoral). The user reports in the internet (and I mean mainly rosaceagroup.org) report almost all better results then with Kataconazol. Only problem with Climbazole is that AFAIK you can not really buy OTC products in USA, because the FDA did not allow it's use (or made no rules I think -> not allowed to sell products with it), but there is no problem in importing the things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that makes System 4 Clibmazole Scalp Tonic so interesting for me is not just climbazole (other active is piroctone olamine) , but it is a leave on product (what is much much better then a rinse product like a shampoo) & for me doesn't make my scalp dry, like many shampoos do & the hair do not look oily after applying & is easy to apply. So you can wash your hair with a really mild shampoo (e.g. a baby shampoo that is Malassezia safe without heavy sulfates, I now ordered  Bioderma ABCDerm Shampoo, hope i will get it today). The only bad thing is it really doesn't smell very good. And that you do not know the concentrations of the actives, but climbazole & piroctone olamine is effective in really really small amounts when it is a leave on product, so probably there will be enough in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI plan to use this Tonic every day till all the Malassezia is gone on my scalp, then just every-some-days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way the whole line does look not so bad, with a lot of different products for different types of hair/scalp: [https://sim.fi/en-system4](https://sim.fi/en-system4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I don't know how you guys in America order this the best, I am from Austria and ordered from nicebeauty.com.

And Tea Tree Oil, but this is probably in too low concentration to be effective / just for smell.",

I use it in my night routine after I was my face with water or with Eucerin ph5 wash bar/ syndet. I do have sensitive skin that hates fragrance in most of the products. I recommend you to try this product by pouring it directly on your face or problematic areas or applying it in your palm and tapping it in with your fingers. When I use cotton pads in general my face gets red. So with this product, I decided to not use them too even if they recommend it so. The product isn't too harsh nor too light. After the application my face isn't stinging nor red. \n\nThis exfoliating toner has a really high efficiency when it comes to vanishing pimples that just started to form (when you feel a tiny bump forming under your skin or a bit of light stinging and redness before the pimple appears). Apply it in this time and it will help a lot, the pimple will dissappear without forming a head or anything similar. At least this is how it  works for me. \n\nAfter the toner, I use Bionike defence aqua spray. Followed by Cosrx Snail mucin essence / Vichy mineral 89 probiotic fractions serum and last Uriage Bariederm Cica cream. Don't make that mistake and use nothing moisturizing after you apply an exfoliating product on your face. Make sure that the essence, serum or moisturizer that you apply after contains no acids but only ingredients that help your skin barrier.\n\nEdit: spelling and additional information",

He posted a pic of their flashy labels, and thus being a sucker for such things, I bit.\n\nThe 4 oz. soap was $11.99; the 4 oz. splash was 11.99; standard USPS shipping was 4.95.  I placed my order on Saturday, February 11.  I received a shipping confirmation the following Monday, and the package arrived at my home in East Texas via USPS the following Friday, February 17.  The products arrived in a generic cardboard box and were securely packed in packing peanuts.  Both the soap and the splash's lids were secured with perforated break-away seals.  Included as a throw-in was a silicone soap dish.  More on the soap dish later.\n\nSince the lure was the packaging, I'll start there.  The labels *do* look as good in person as they do on their site.  They're bright and colorful even if they're a little busy.  The side label is welcomed and legibly denotes the product name as well as the logo and ingredients list (*ingredients list for soap and splash can be found at the end of this review*).  The side label is not perfectly centered, and one corner is abraded as if someone attempted to peel and re-try.  The top label is perfectly placed and without blemish.  The labels are, in fact, water-proof with a shiny luster.  I also note both the product name and company logo on the top label are slightly raised and have a different texture from the rest of the label giving the impression of a very thin decal, when in reality it's probably just a printing technique.  This overlay effect causes the logo and product name to stand out from the back ground.  It's a very professional job.\n\nThe plastic jar is frosted and double-walled with an internal diameter of 81 mm.  It's 44 mm high without the lid and 47 mm with the lid. The opaque black lid is recessed with ribbed sides and has some flex and thus is not brittle. If my research pans out, the jar appears to be [Olcott Plastics model JDSF0489PP](http://www.olcottplastics.com/products/4oz-89mm-double-wall-straight-side-frosted/).  The soap filled the jar to approximately 1 cm below the top.\n\nThe splash bottle is crystal clear and stands 108 mm high with the lid.  It's 53 mm wide and 32 mm deep.  The screw-top lid is black and ribbed.  It has separate front and back labels done in the same style as the matching soap.  The label execution is not quite as professional as that of the soap.  The labels are slightly crooked, and the front one is off-center.  The corners of said labels are also peeling.  Again, the peeling does not appear to be non-adhesion, but rather a failed attempt to remove the label.  It's a comparatively small detraction.  The flow limiter is effective allowing you to control pour the thin product into your palm without having to shake it out.\n\nThe dry consistency of the soap is that of a typical croap on the firmer end of the spectrum with an off-white even color.  The scent off the dry puck is a pleasant, clean, gentle, slightly powdery citrus with a hint of earth.  I loaded with the outstanding 30 mm Tuxedo knot courtesy of APShaveCo.  With a slightly damp knot, the soap loaded easily.  As per my usual technique, I aggressively loaded for about 45 seconds to accommodate for a 3-pass head and face shave.  There was only a minimal amount of wasted proto-lather as the usable product pulled into the knot.  I quickly dipped the tips into my reserve water and began face lathering.  The initial distribution was much thinner than I'd expected, but it very quickly expanded into a thick pillowy lather.  After switching to paint strokes, the lather transformed into the desired manageable dense substrate most of us prefer.  Meanwhile, the knot had doubled in size.\n\nThe protection was excellent and glide was on par with most of my other preferred artisan soaps.  Freshly shorn areas maintained some slickness, but nothing approaching that of the elite artisans.  Reconstituting with a wet palm didn't change this. It doesn't change the quality of the shave, but one would probably want to avoid touch-ups without visible lather.\n\nThe lathered fragrance of El Barbero is about the same as the off-the-puck scent.  It's somewhat uninspired, but I probably shouldn't have high expectations having ordered their \"Barber Shop\" scent.  They claim a \"Miami feel\" twist to the traditional barber shop, but I don't feel it.  It's pleasant, for sure, but it doesn't stand out among other artisans' citrus/earth/powder barber shop offerings.  The scent strength is bold enough for me, but others may prefer a little more punch.  I would call it a 3.5 out of 5.\n\nAfter the shave, as part of my unprofessional method of testing, I smeared the pulled lather onto my head and face while I cleaned up the gear. I noticed no ill-effects or warmth or tingling.  After rinsing, my skin felt very soft, supple, and moisturized such that a post product is not essential even for my sensitive skin.\n\nThe aftershave splash felt great with just enough glycerin to facilitate distribution.  Despite the inclusion of aloe, I did not detect any tackiness.  Interestingly, as I review the ingredients, I see the inclusion of \"menthol crystals\".  I honestly do not recall any cooling sensation other than what I'd expect from any room temp liquid applied to my warm skin.  The splash's fragrance is a good match for the soap, and it may be a bit more citrus-forward.  About an hour later I detected a healthy amount of earthiness with hints of oakmoss, and the previously non-descript citrus became more specific to bergamot.  I can't speak to the staying-power of the fragrance because I fell asleep about 4 hours after the shave.  However, it did last at least that long.\n\nA 3-pass head and face shave went quickly, and it was an overall pleasant shave.  The performance is one that most of us will be happy to revisit and keep in our ever-growing rotations.  As a first impression, I feel like Lather Bros., while not topping out the field of elite artisans, it is certainly better than average.  They're already far ahead of the curve with regard to packaging, and the performance, with only a little tweaking, could easily hold its own with the top-notch artisans.\n\nOther than being based in Miami Lakes, Florida, I know nothing else about the artisan/company.  The \"about\" section on the website is incomplete.  They are on twitter and Instagram.  I have sent an inquiry via their site asking for a bio, but as of this writing, I've not heard back. EDIT: Found more info on the artisans: https://www.instagram.com/p/BM1fYGhgsH3/\n\nIn addition to shaving soaps and aftershaves, Lather Bros. also makes tallow bath bars and non-tallow \"shampoo\" bars.  They offer a free silicone soap dish for signing up for their newsletter.  I did not sign up, but a soap dish was included in my order.  It's a pretty nice flexible silicone dish. It has replaced my rubber shelf-liner on which I place my razor while shower shaving.\n\n**Shaving Soap Ingredients**: Stearic Acid, Coconut Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Guava Puree, Tallow, Coconut Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Lactate Essential Oils and Fragrance\n\n**Aftershave Splash Ingredients**:  Organic Aloe Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Witch Hazel Water, Phenoxyethanol, Organic White Willow Bark Extract, Menthol Crystals, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Organic Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Essential Oils and Fragrance oils",

    "body": "**Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water**\n\nCleansing waters are kind of a new category for me. I used the Neogen Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Water back in May which was my first ever. So, I don‚Äôt have a ton to go off of when it comes to comparisons. And for the most part...that product from Neogen and the Essenherb Cleansing Water were pretty similar in application and cleansing.\n\nThe Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water features coconut based surfactants that help to remove impurities like makeup and sunscreen. I tend to use cleansing waters in the AM in place of an oil cleanser or even water/foaming cleanser if I‚Äôm feeling particularly lazy lol. I also found them to be helpful in the PM when removing sunscreen from the eye area when an oil cleanser might cause stinging/blurring if put too close to the eyes.\n\nFeatured ingredients include Tea Tree Leaf Extract, Anise Fruit Extract, Tea Tree Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Chamomile Flower Extract, Peppermint and Aloe Extract also make the list.\n\nYou could probably guess...the scent here is of tea tree lol! It‚Äôs something that I find refreshing but does remind me of the acne focused skincare I used in my teens. I could see some people not liking it too much.\n\nAs a cleansing water...this product performed just fine for me. I found it to do a decent job of removing excess oil/sebum from the night before and I never really noticed any residue left behind. It just...did its job lol!¬†\n\nBut, one ingredient that makes it fairly high on the list that I didn‚Äôt mention is Witch Hazel. Even though I don‚Äôt have a ton of personal experience with this ingredient...I know there are people that avoid it due to its potential drying/astringent effect.\n\nI can say that over time I found the Essenherb Tea Tree Cleansing Water to be a bit drying after use. Not much...but there was a definite difference in the feel of my skin as compared to the Neogen Cleansing Water I used earlier this year. It honestly wasn‚Äôt anything that my hydrating toner couldn‚Äôt pick up the slack for. But, those with particularly dry skin may want to proceed with caution.\n\nOverall, I didn‚Äôt hate this cleansing water. It just seems like something that is really geared towards oily/acne prone skin with its tea tree/Witch Hazel formula. While I do tend to fall into that category more often than not...I didn‚Äôt love the slightly drying effect and would much rather use something more ‚Äúneutral‚Äù for this step.\n\nI look forward to continuing my ‚Äújourney‚Äù into cleansing waters. I have two more in my stash that seem to be more focused on hydration/calming alongside cleansing rather than oil reduction or acne fighting. We shall see‚Ä¶\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Allantoin, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory $25.00 USD): https://www.facetory.com/products/essenherb-tea-tree-cleansing-water\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akgtnwh7chd51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad4471a97891d425aaf7390f120cf0d095fb6cd4",

First it was only on her groin, but now she got it on the rest of the body too - basically it looks like dandruff. \n\nI took Truffle to the dermatologist and she told me its nothing serious and to wash her with an oat shampoo. She recommended me one but it has SLS and I'm not sure about using it - is it not that good for hair and skin as it is with humans?

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou‚Äôre starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can‚Äôt pronounce an ingredient, don‚Äôt use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you‚Äôd be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you‚Äôd like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don‚Äôt want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you‚Äôll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

    "body": "Hello everyone. I have lately been applying a foot balm (more on the product below) to my face, and I was wondering if it could be a bad idea...\n\nI am a male (23) and luckily I no longer have severe acne problems. Just the usual pimple or pustule, not more than 2 or 3 at a time. \n\nAbout a month ago or so, I tried using this foot balm on a single pimple that was growing on my face. Surprisingly, the pimple disappeared in 2 or 3 days, way faster than what they usually take. So since then I have been using it on every single pimple/pustule that starts growing on my face. This way they don't get as big and red as they used to, and they only last for 2 or 3 days.\n\nI'm not complaining at all, but I can't help but ask myself if doing this could be bad for my skin. As I said, I do not use in over all my face, just over the pimples. Besides this foot balm, I use a cleanser and a moisturizer almost daily.\n\nAdditionally (sorry if it's offtopic) I would also want to know why does this work. Checking on the ingredients, the only one that could help is Lactic Acid, but this acid is used to prevent acne breakouts, not to treat already existing pimples.\n\nI do not post the product link cause that would be against the forum rules (correct me if I'm wrong and I will post it).\n\nI'll write down the active ingredients here instead:\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (water), Sesamum indicum seed oil (nourishing sesame oil), Citrus aurantium dulcis fruit water\\* (orange hydrosol), Polyglyceryl-6 pentaoleate (emulsifier derived from sesame oil), Sambucus nigra fruit extract (antioxidant elderberry extract), Propanediol, Glycerin (plant-derived moisturiser), Brassica campestris/aleurites fordi oil copolymer (natural polymer from rapeseed and tung tree oil), Salix alba bark extract (skin-soothing willow bark extract), Adansonia digitata seed oil\\* (baobab oil), Opuntia ficus-indica seed oil (prickly pear seed oil), Limnanthes alba seed oil (meadowfoam seed oil), Zinc stearate (zinc-fatty acid compound), Magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt), Arginine (moisturising amino acid), Olea europaea oil unsaponifiables (unsaponifiable part of olive oil), Symphytum officinale root extract (comfrey root extract), Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter\\* (grooming cupuacu butter), Equisetum arvense extract (soothing common horsetail extract), Leptospermum scoparium branch/leaf oil (manuka oil), Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil\\* (eucalyptus oil), Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil\\* (tea tree oil), Salvia officinalis oil (sage oil), Astrocaryum tucuma seed butter\\* (pampering tucuma butter), Bisabolol, Menthol\\* (from Mentha arvensis), Camphor, Mangifera indica seed butter\\* (mango butter), Rhus verniciflua peel cera / Rhus succedanea fruit cera (berry wax / sumac wax), Phenethyl alcohol (rose alcohol), Shorea robusta resin (sala tree resin), Helianthus annuus seed cera (sunflower wax), Tocopherol (vitamin E), Malic acid (apple acid), (L+) Lactic Acid (Lactic acid), Hydrogenated rapeseed oil (thickener from rapeseed oil), CI 75810 (chlorophyll derivative), Limonene¬∞",

    "body": "# Starting tretinoin and need suggestions for a routine...\n\nüì∑\n\nHi all!\n\nI have mild hormonal and digestive (I think?) acne on my forehead and cheeks/jawline; at least, my medical esthetician seems to think so. I was recently prescribed tretinoin by my MD. I never struggled with acne for my whole life until about 1.5 years ago (when I started graduate school).\n\nMy medical esthetician seems to think I don't need it, because she's bigger on eating healthy (avoiding dairy/sugar/starches) and a simple but effective regimen. My skin gets a bit better when I'm really strict with my diet and when I see her regularly (every 2 weeks), but it requires a lot of self-discipline and $$$ to do those things, respectively. Also, it never really goes away, just reduces it a bit. Of course, I'm still going to eat healthy and drink lots of water and follow a good regime, but I'm frustrated and I think I need something stronger at this point.\n\nPer my medical esthetician, I am currently using:\n\n**Ayur-Medic Antibacterial Wash with Exfoliating Beads for Blemish-Prone Skin**\n\nActive ingredients; *Benzoyl Peroxid*e 2.5%\n\nInactive ingredients: (INCI) Water (Aqua), Cocoamidopropyl Hydroxsultaine, Polyethylene beads, Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Aloe barbedensis Leaf Extract, Triethanolamine, Mentha viridis (Spearmint) leaf oil, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Chamomilla recutita flower extract, Rosemarinus officinalis leaf extract, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil.\n\nand\n\n**Cosmedix Clarity Skin-Clarifying Serum:**\n\nHamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Alcohol Denat., Aqua, Alcohol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid \\[Exfoliant\\], Acetylsalicylic Acid, *Retinol, Retinyl Acetate,* Galactoarabinan, Hydroxyproline (L), Saccharide Isomerate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Epilobium Angustifolium (Willowherb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Collinsonia Canadensis (Stone Root) Extract, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit (Saw Palmetto) Extract, Ruscus Aculeatus (Butcher's Broom) Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**and NO moisturizers** since she said that, if the serum feels moisturizing enough (and, surprisingly, it does), it's fine. It sucks, because I love how these products feel on my skin, and it's definitely improved since she's helped me develop a better regimen, but my skin is nowhere near where I want it to be.\n\nI realize that the ingredients in these may not be compatible with using retinoin. I'm considering investing in Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Face Cleanser, La Roche Posay cicaplast baume B5, Cerave healing ointment, and maybe some sort of serum/oil, or an occlusive, and, of course, sunscreen. I've perused through a lot of the threads here, and there seem to be so many options, I'm not even sure where to start. I wish I could just integrate it into my skincare routine, but I'm also hoping that maybe I can still use the two products I'm currently using occasionally.\n\nI plan to ease my way into it (I plan to use it 1-2 a week for a while, buffering it with a moisturizer).\n\nCliffs:\n\n\\-Have been seeing medical esthetician for months to treat forehead/cheek/jaw acne (pustules) that I've struggled with for 1.5 year\n\n\\-Esthetician doesn't want me to start tretinoin, and though my skin has improved a little over the past several months, it's back and forth a lot and nowhere near where I need it to be\n\n\\-Currently using a cleanser and serum with active ingredients not compatible with tretinoin (benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, respectively) \n\n\\-Struggling to establish a regimen that is good for me (need recommendations!)\n\n\\-Is there a way I can switch off with the above products and and a new tretinoin? I.e., use those on the days I don't use tret, and then use a tret-friendly cleanser/moisturizer on the days I do?\n\nThank you for reading! :) Open to any and all suggestions...I'm desperate!",

My skin is usually rather sensitive (it reacts to 2 of 3 products I try on my face and then burns and turns red instantly - has reacted to quite a few Kiehl's products and the Ordinary's niacinimide). I went for an appointment with my beautician yesterday and my skin appears to be more sensitive than usual, it reacted to 2 products she tried to use to calm my skin and decided to use an ampoule in the end (not sure what it is exactly but it stopped the heat/burn and calmed the redness a little). \n\nI took a shower earlier and washed my face twice (because I forgot I washed it already... stupid I know), and after my shower I usually apply a toner, serum, then moisturise. I skipped the serum because my face seemed to be reacting to the usual toner I used, and then reacted more to my moisturiser. I've used these products for over a year and it's the first time my skin has reacted to them  so I'm a little shocked. Washed them off then settled for another moisturiser from my beautician's place.\n\nSkin type: combination skin (more dry on my cheeks), prone to breakouts especially when I have my period or am stressed\n\nAM Routine:   \nCleanser - Kiehl's Calendula Deep Foaming Face Wash  \nToner - cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad\n\n(I know I should be using sunscreen, but I breakout easily and am reluctant to cake too much stuff on my face. Some recommendations for light sunscreen I've seen online aren't available here in Singapore so I still haven't found a solution yet.)\n\nPM Routine:  \nCleanser - Kiehl's Calendula Deep Foaming Face Wash  \nToner - cosrx One Step Original Clear Pad  \nSerum - Simple Logic Regenerating Serum (this is bought from my beautician's place, a google search would tell you where it is because they seem to be the ONLY PLACE in the whole world using this brand??? If anyone else has heard of it please please tell me cause I'm weirded out by how there's literally no other trace of this supposedly German brand on the Internet. Ingredient list: Purified Water, Glycerin Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Solanum Lycopersicum Fruit Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Polysorbate 20, Sclerotium Gum Diazolidinyl Urea, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Methylparaben, Propylparaben)  \nMoisturiser - cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence  \nMoisturiser #2 if my skin is feeling really dry - cosrx Advanced Snail 92 All in one Cream (I've stuck to snail mucin because I thought my skin would never react since it's essentially mostly water but apparently not because my skin seemed to hate it earlier)\n\nThe moisturiser I used just now that my skin didn't react to: Skin-Logical Hydro Repair (another mystery brand from my beautician's place, Ingredients: Water, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, DMDM Hydantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Fragrance, Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbonate.)\n\nI have literally no memory of changing anything in my diet or skincare routine and the sudden ramp up in sensitivity is making me a little unsettled. I'm scared of trying out new products because my skin reacts to most, I've tried spot testing before but I have eczema on my elbows and the product didn't react until I put it on my face) so any recommendations or advice on how to improve my routine and calm the redness and somehow tune down sensitivity would be extremely helpful!!\n\n(reposted because I had to check how to add the tag - sorry!)",

I changed back to my old cream treatment and the hair was instantly good again it only took me one shower. \n\nAlso one day I used this conditioner, *Naturals by Watson (ing: water, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, cetrimonium chloride,  propylen glicol, isononyl isononanoate, hydroxyethylcellulose, parfum, dmdm hydantoin, behentrimonium chloride, tetrasodium EDTA, citric acid, isopropyl alcohol, sodium acetate, cellulose, grambe abyssinica, seed oil, argania spinosa kernel oil, niacinamide, panthenol, avocado oil, argan extract, wheat germ extract, malic acid, tartaric acid, sodium benzoate, hibiscus flower extract, rosa canina flower extract, salicylic acid, sweet violet flower extract, dlimonene, linalol) as first conditioner, 50% water and my regular beauty and planet as second conditioner and I woke up with hair like picture B. Again just took me one shower with my regular Pantene and my regular beauty and planet to get my hair back to normal. \n\nThis week I also started to do low poo, just to try, and I used this shampoo (aqua, polyquatermyum-7 sodium chloride, D-panthenol, menthol cocamidopropyl betaine, cocamide dea, Ci no 79140, fragance) and my Pantene as conditioner, the hair was good as always.\nBut last night I used the same shampoo with my second conditioner, the beauty and planet and Today my hair was back to pic B, sooo I'm again in this clueless situation, why if I always use my second conditioner I woke up like this? \n\nIf someone can help me solve this I will be forever thankful.",

It's brittle and frizzy and just not healthy. My hair is also falling out a lot but that may be something else. I went to look for a gentle conditioner that doesn't contain too many oils because I also have mild SebDerm on the back of my head. In my experience oils make my sebderm noticeably worse. I came across Clayge treatment that appeared to have fewer oils in it but I still don't know what it really is because my Japanese is so bad. The only English info I could find on the internet was the company's warning not to use it if you have eczema. I don't know if Sebderm counts. \n\nI usually use a shampoo bar my mom makes every other day or so with a scalp brush and would like to work a conditioner into the routine. \nDoes anyone have experience with this product or something similar?\nHow should a treatment be used?

    "body": "Hi yall, this is my first post in this sub (should have tagged this \"routine help\" also oops) and I'm seeking a bit of advice on whether or not these new routine changes seem to be working. Please shout out if I'm making any sort of glaring mistakes. I'm 27 and have dry, acne prone skin that seems to have started settling down more in the last few months, so I wanted to focus on improving my skin texture, minimize scarring, and add radiance to my dull face. Fast forward to me adding some new products to help with this and now my acne has worsened a bit.\n\nI started slowly introducing TO Lactic Acid 10% and Glycolic Acid Toner on Jan 5th. Started with once a week and have now bumped it up to between 3 and 4, plus the TO AHA/BHA mask only once a week. I haven't had any adverse reactions to these that I can tell and my moisture barrier seems intact? I also started using these Disciple Good Skin and Dreamy Skin oils at the same time for a thicker moisturizer bc winter. I'm worried that these are more comedogenic because of the essential oils in them and olive oil is listed on the ingredients (I've included the full ingredient list in my routine breakdown per the Disciple website). I think my skin has purged a bit from adding acid exfoliation since the acne comes to a head quicker and it's located in my typical break out areas. But I have noticed that any spots that have come to the surface now are quite deep and leave these darker red marks after scabbing over.  (I've been very good at not popping them, but sometimes the whiteheads come open when I'm in the shower or washing my face.) I also get random red spots (closed comedones?) that seem like they'll surface into pimples but then they either just sit there without forming heads or if I'm lucky, they disappear. This usually happens on my cheeks, forehead, and chin and they sometimes come in little clusters. I've also been using a new spot treatment called Pickel-Break for the past week but haven't noticed it reducing pimple size or really doing much of anything. My chin has always been my major acne problem area, so are these old dirty pores getting all the gunk out or am I just clogging them more? Any routine recommendations or other product ideas to help with these issues would be much appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoutine Breakdown:\n\n\\-Old routine was with the same cleansers before the I added The Ordinary acids.\n\n\\-Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream was my main moisturizer for day and night before the I added the Disciple products.\n\n\\-Differin Gel was my PM active occasionally in my old routine \\~3x week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAM:\n\nAlex Steinherr Micellar Cleansing Gel\n\nKiehl's Powerful Strength Line Reducing 12.5% Vitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\nDisciple Good Skin Oil (*Ingredients: Cucumber seed oil, Turmeric oil\\*, Rosemary oil, Geranium oil\\*,* *Ashwagandha root oil\\*, Lavender oil, Tea tree oil, Burdock root extract\\*\\*, Extra virgin olive oil.)*¬†\n\nSoltan Kids 50+ SPF\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM:\n\nAlex Steinherr Low pH Cleanser w Salicylic Acid\n\nThe Ordinary Glycolic Acid Toner \\*Twice a week as only active acid\n\n\\-**OR**\\-\n\nThe Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + Hyaluronic Acid \\*Twice a week as only active acid when not using GA Toner\n\nDisciple Dreamy Skin Oil (*Ingredients:* *Rosehip seed oil (Rosa Mosqueta), Watermelon seed oil, Retinyl palmitate, Blue chamomile oil\\*, Frankincense oil\\*, Jojoba oil,* *Ashwagandha root oil\\*, Jasmine oil, Burdock root extract\\*\\*, Extra virgin olive oil.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes:\n\nDifferin Gel \\*when not using Kiehl's Vit C during AM routine if my skin is being extra problematic (I haven't used this at all this month with the new products)\n\nDr Jart Ceramidin Cream or The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Hyaluronic Acid when I don't want to feel oilier during the day, I also add these before my night oil if I'm feeling extra dry\n\nThe Ordinary AHA/BHA Mask \\*once per week\n\nPickel Break Acne Spot Treatment on active acne when needed (ALCHOL DENAT., MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA LEAF OIL, LEMONENE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, CITRUS AURANTIUM DULCIS PEEL OIL, AROMA, PANTHENOL, AQUA, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA ROOT EXTRACT, USNA BARBATA EXTRACT, BENZYL BENZOATE, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRAL, GERANIOL, LINALOOL.)\n\n[sorry for the bad lighting in the bottom left photo](https://preview.redd.it/z8c5r9k54ld21.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3cc41624ace70532acc3d5ef2d3a31bb6d3db20)",

    "body": "Hi! I am newbie to nails, few of my nails chip so I decided to strenghten them. \n\n1.) As a first layer I started to use a simple nail polish from an \"all natural\" organic brand that just contains **shellac** and orange oil, camomile extract and an essential oil. It really smells nice, just like a body oil scented lightly with essential oils would, it absolutely contains none of that typical nail polish smell and this also is the problem - the ingredients are mild, the oil can kind of sink into the nail and nourish it, and the shellac dries, but this coat totally disappears in a day (not sure if the dried shellac even allows the oil to nourish the nail). **Hence I decided to purchase a more typical nail hardener / base coat that I apply over this shellac coat.**\n\n2.) The nail hardener I bought contains pretty standard ingredients any nail hardener / base coat contains here in the EU, so I just chose one that is called X-treme Nail Hardener by S-he stylezone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ethyl Acetate | Butyl Acetate | Nitrocellulose | Acetyl Tributyl Citrate | Adipic Acid / Neopentyl Glycol / Trimellitic Anhydride Copolymer | Isopropyl Alcohol | Styrene / Acrylates Copolymer | Silica | Propylene Glycol | Aqua | Etocrylene | Cetyl Palmitate | Cyclomethicone | Hydrolyzed Keratin | Sorbitan Stearate | Dimethicone | Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride | Polysorbate 80 | Tocopheryl Acetate | Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil | Sodium Benzoate | Lecithin | BHT | CI 60725\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However my problem is I can scrape the coat off with my nail?** Like totally. Do all nail polishes dry this semi-soft? I mean I was expecting a tough titanium layer - this is called an X-treme nail hardener after all! - not a layer I can easily scrape off. Do I need a top coat? Do those dry hard? Or do all polishes dry like this? If so, I do not really see a point in applying them to protect my nails from chipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks! <3",

However, when i put it in my hair and try to rinse it, it becomes impossible to run my hands through my hair! It's honestly so weird, basically when i pass my hands through my hair it kinda gets stuck, it isn't slippery at all! I eventually give up on trying to get it smooth because it literally won't leave my hair. \nAfter drying it, my hair feels dull and dry! \nHowever, my hair is more curly than ever! Ejat6is going on?? \nHere's the ingredient list, is there anything here that could be causing this reaction?\n\n-Olea europaea fruit oil, persea gratissima oil, cistus ladaniferus leaf/steam water, ricinus communis seed oil, sodium hydroxide, butyrospermum parkii butter, simmondsia chinensis seed oil, sucrose, mentha piperita oil, melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, litsea cubeba fruit oil, lavandula stoechas extract, limonene, linalool, citral, geraniol",

And yeah this was not a good idea at all as my skin was already very clear. So I decided to use her Skin Therapy Tea Tree Scrub. I don't know for sure what is in it, but I woke up to redness and spots all over my cheeks and chin.\n\nI only had used it once, and didn't use it again. But the redness and spots are still present even after 2 years. I've never had acne, but I'm not too sure if the ingredients in the scrub started off some sort of acne? I only put a extremely light moisturiser now, wash my face with a light face wash and that's about it.\n\nI've just searched up the face scrub that started off the issue and I'm not too sure what all the chemicals do üò≠.\n\nThe link is https://www.trolley.co.uk/product/skin-therapy-tea-tree-facial-scrub/UUG618\n\nI can see that the ingredients are: Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrated Silica, Panthenol, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, 2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-Propanol, water.\n\nI'm not to sure which of these ingredients started off the spots/acne, but I also don't know what to stop the spots and redness.",

It seems especially tocopherol is awful for me (hello, every  SPF ever). I also reacted poorly to oil cleansing, so I've been wanting to try double cleansing with micellar water instead. So after lots more research I'm now sketching up a routine that I will ease into one product at a time. \n\nDoes it have too many actives? Is it too complicated, should I simplify it?

I didn't think anything of it until I used it for the first time and realized just how *strong* the scent is, and I've always had trouble finding solid info about tea tree and cats. [Here is the product and the ingredients list](https://www.renpure.com/products/hair/plant-based-tea-tree-rosemary-refresh-rebalance-shampoo/). It lists both tea tree leaf oil as well as rosemary leaf extract.\n\nNeither of my cats stay in the bathroom while I'm showering, but my youngest (5 month/female) is big enough to get in the tub by herself now, and she tends to lick up the water leftover and will even bring her toys in there to play with them. Is there any reason for me to worry about using this product?",

    "body": "I‚Äôd appreciate advice on a persistent skin issue: my dog is very itchy in the middle of his back, and many vets haven‚Äôt been able to diagnose it. \n\nHe‚Äôs an 8 yo black lab mix. Starting 6 months after moving to San Diego (from the Midwest), his back started to get so itchy he tenses up in relief when you scratch there. If he‚Äôs not taking Apoquel he will itch through his coat. You can see he has brownish dryness where his hair follicles come out (should be white skin) and that‚Äôs only his his back, not anywhere else on his body. When it flakes it causes dandruff.\n\nThings Ive tried to treat it like it‚Äôs parasites:\n-Trifexis once a month and removed him from hikes/beaches for a long time\n-Duoxo and other antibacterial anti fungal shampoos 10 minutes twice a week until I realized that didn‚Äôt work. \n-Topical coconut oil or tea tree leaf oil. \n-I‚Äôve done skin scraping under microscope, and there‚Äôs never been a sign of fungus or parasites. - Regular vets appointments have never found any sign of parasite, over multiple vets.\n\nThings I use to treat it likes it‚Äôs food allergies: \n-Royal Canin hypoallergenic rx diet. \n-Supplemented with a fish oil pill per day.\n-I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs food allergies. He had food allergies whe he was young, but that made him itchy all over, like his belly. But right now he‚Äôs just itchy on his back.\n\nThings I do to deal with Environmental Allergies: \n-did an allergen panel test. I was told he‚Äôs very allergic to San Diego grasses, pollens, mites, human skin, everything. \n-I decided to do allergen desensitization shots (expensive, custom allergen mix prescribed to him that I would inject.) I did that for about 6 months on the schedule prescribed. It didn‚Äôt help at all so I stopped.\n-Walked him on sidewalks only for months to avoid pollens. Changed all his dog beds, covered my couch with linens, etc.\n\nThings I do to just deal with the itch:\n-He‚Äôs on the drug Apoquel 36mg per day which reduced itching, so at least he‚Äôs not scratching through his skin. \n\nBut this addresses the symptom not the underlying issue, because the brownish dryness on his skin is still there. I‚Äôm at a point where I am just living with it, and at least he‚Äôs not suffering thanks to the daily apoquel. Still, once in a while I wonder if it‚Äôs something they are missing. What‚Äôs causing the brownish dry skin?!",

He gets yeast and dead skin buildup in his nail beds and intermittent patches of dandruff/buildup on his back no matter what we do. I've also tried all the wipes, shampoos, soaks etc.\n\nHe is allergic to chicken, beef and lamb but even without those proteins he is still crazy itchy from the environmental stuff. I wipe my apartment down constantly, I wipe his paws with anti-fungal and anti-bacterial wipes every time we come inside and it's at the point where it's manageable but the underlying issue hasn't been solved and I'm coming to accept that it might never be.\n\nI've decided not to pursue the allergen panel test and custom shots for the time being because my dermatologist said two things:\n\n1. They have a 60-70% efficacy rating so they just don't work for a non-insignificant number of dogs (+ it's so freakin expensive)\n2. It's strongly recommended you keep your dog on them for at least a year before determining if they don't work and discontinuing.\n\nSo based on that knowledge, it sounds like it's possible you stopped those shots too early or (probably more likely) your dog is just in the percentage of dogs that doesn't respond to that treatment.\n\nSounds like the dry skin is just the underlying symptom of the allergies - which most vet dermatologists think is caused by an actual defect in the skin barrier itself. So even if your dog isn't itching, there's evidence of skin problems anyways.\n\nSolidarity, skin issues are so hard.",

Do I just have to be patient and wait it out? Is this just a transition period? Or just these products don't suit me? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPls share your experience and tips!

A bit of research on the webz would explain most of them and what the benefits are though. Once i get to stuff I can't pronounce I stop reading and put it back. www.mrbeards.com has some products that are awesome. They cost more than $4 but you can pronounce everything on the label and they smell fantastic.",
