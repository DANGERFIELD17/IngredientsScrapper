    "body": "Hello all! So I was answering a question on r/AsianBeauty, but I thought maybe it will help some other people out who is dealing with dehydrated skin.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a dumbass and used vitamin c crystals and mixed with water and used that for my \"vitamin c serum\" and completely overexfoliated my skin/got a chemical burn basically. And before and after that too, I thought exfoliating more was better (using AHA/glycolic acid/lactic acid), and did that everyday, which caused my skin barrier to get reck'd.\n\nIt took me a good year/year-and-a-half to fix my skin. This is what worked for me personally:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what I do is use a very gentle, non-foaming cleanser (I use [LRP Gentle Hydrating](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Hydrating-Gentle-Cleanser/dp/B01N7T7JKJ/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538877830&sr=8-1&keywords=la%2Broche%2Bposay%2Bhydrating&th=1)) and while my face is still wet, put on all my hydrating toners and serums. Then go into lotions and creams RIGHT AWAY. Putting on occlusives right away after you wash and put on humectants is super important. Otherwise they can actually dry your skin out more.\n\nWhen my skin was SO full of pain, from extremely dry, tight skin and irritated acne-like cysts everywhere, the only thing that didn’t hurt like a mf was Vanicream. It took me hundreds of dollars and tons of trial and error and babying my skin to get it back to normal. Now I can use AHA, azelaic acid, vitamin c, and even tretinoin and hydroquinone without a problem!!!\n\nNo one or two products fixed my dehydrated skin. It took a TON of research over the years learning which ingredients were the most healing, moisturizing, how they work, etc.. And an entire routine around hydrating and moisturizing as much as possible. \n\n**I always make sure to include ingredients like:** panthenol (derivative of vitamin b5), allantoin, urea (a HUGE factor in getting my skin back to normal), hualuronic acid, glycerin, aloe, colloidal oatmeal, ceramides (important!!!), niacinamide (especially useful for brightening and healing your skin), petroleum (studies show that there is NOTHING out there that reduces transepidermal water loss like petroleum can. I tried to be all \\~natural is better\\~ for a while, but realized it wasn't doing anything to help fix my skin), etc.\n\nAnd not just adding these helped fix my skin, but **leaving things out** was a YUGE step in finally letting my skin heal. I avoid these like the plague: fragrance, natural (essential oils) or synthetic, alcohol anywhere other than sunscreen, sodium lauryl sulfate (sodium LAURETH sulfate is the gentler one, but I avoid that for my face too anyways. Surfectants can be aided to be milder by adding cocamidopropyl betaine), **LAY OFF all acids** until my skin could handle them (interestingly enough, vitamin c serum actually helped my skin hold more water instead of hurting me), and things that I know irritate my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things that were/are biggest contributors of keeping my skin moist and hydrated, in no particular order:**\n\n[**Thayers Unscented Alcohol-Free Witch Haze**l](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-free-Unscented-Witch-12-oz/dp/B0045PCAI6/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871279&sr=8-1&keywords=thayers+unscented) \\- the first thing that goes on my skin after washing. It's just water, aloe, glycerin and witch hazel. It's so simple but idk why my skin likes it so much, lol. It's HG for me.\n\n[**Hadalabo Premium Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Hadalabo-Skin-Institute-hyaluronic-solution/dp/B013HHJV0C/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871410&sr=8-1&keywords=hadalabo+premium) \\- HG, must have. **Hyaluronic acids**, urea, algae. This is my one non-negotiable skin care item.\n\n[**Aveeno Eczema Therapy Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Eczema-Therapy-Moisturizing-Sensitive/dp/B003O7IBZC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-3&keywords=aveeno%2Beczema&th=1) \\- Super moisturizing. **Colloidal oatmeal**, glycerin, panthenol, petrolatum, a ceramide, dimethicone. (People demonize silicones, but they are not bad ingredients. They are actually really helpful in keeping in moisture, providing slip, and smooth feel for skin and hair. And no, they don't prevent other things from reaching the skin. [More on silicones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXHA7_dBRJY&t=12s).) And [Aveeno Eczema Therapy Night Time Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Baby-Nighttime-Colloidal-Dimethicone/dp/B01HI7VY84/ref=sr_1_4_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871429&sr=8-4&keywords=aveeno+eczema) for something heavier but has same ingredients. You can use both.\n\nAnd of course, [**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Cream-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B00TTD9BRC/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538871829&sr=8-3&keywords=cerave+cream) \\- **ceramides, cholesterol, must have skin-identical lipids** that dehydrated skin lacks, hyaluronic acid, petrolatum, dimethicone. This by itself didn't help a whole lot, but with an army of all the different gentle, soothing things, it helped tremendously. There are lots of other \"golden ratio\"/fragrance-free ceramide stuff out there, CeraVe isn't the only one. Some of them are: [Stratia Liquid Gold](https://www.stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold), [Meishoku CeraColla gel](https://www.ebay.com/itm/JAPAN-MEISHOKU-CERACOLLA-MOISTURIZER-CREAM-50g-FACE-SKIN-CARE/173351832927?epid=1541103247&hash=item285c930d5f%3Ag%3AjbkAAOSweEFbFoJ-&LH_BIN=1) (they have toners as well), [Superdrug Hydrating Serum](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face-Skin-Care/Face-Serums/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Hydrating-Serum-50ml/p/342700), [Curel Fragrance-Free lotions](https://www.amazon.com/Cur%C3%A9l-Fragrance-Comforting-Lotion-Sensitive/dp/B00171ETM6?th=1), [Ziaja Med Atopic Dermatitis Regenerating Face Cream](https://yanca.co.uk/product-eng-16098-Ziaja-Med-AD-Atopic-Dermatitis-Regenerating-CREAM-oiling-the-skin-atopic-for-infants-children-and-adults-50ml-5901887027942.html), among many others.\n\n[**CeraVe PM**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B079H99466/ref=sr_1_1_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1538872080&sr=1-1&keywords=cerave+pm)\\- same as the cream, but much, much lighter and has 4% **niacinamide** I believe. Niacinamide has been key to helping my dry-ass skin. It does SO many things. Heals and mends, fades spots,etc. etc. I DIY 6% niacinamide and 5% **n-acetyl glucosamine** to boost the niacinamide even further. (Commercial version [Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)) But you can find this ingredient in loads of Asian Beauty things and Olay products. Make sure the Olay stuff is fragrance-free if you get them. I like the [Olay Anti-Aging Face Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Anti-Aging-Moisturizer-Micro-Sculpting-Fragrance-Free/dp/B007M81B4M/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872043&sr=8-3&keywords=olay+fragrance+free) a lot. It really helps refine texture, as well. You can use the CeraVe moisturizing lotion if you for some reason can't tolerate niacinamide, but want something lighter than the cream. Really, any one of CeraVe products is good, they have loads.\n\n[**Aquaphor Healing Ointment**](https://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Advanced-Therapy-Ointment-Protectant/dp/B0107QPFBU/ref=sr_1_5_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872144&sr=8-5&keywords=aquaphor) \\- SLUG LIFE is a MUST if you have dehydrated skin. You can use Cerave healing ointment too, but it's redundant if you use the cream or lotion. It's not as occlusive as aquaphor. Aquaphor isn't just a more pricier Vaseline as people suggest. It does have white petrolatum that is oh-so helpful, it also has healing ingredients like panthenol and bisobolol, and also lanolin alcohol and glycerin for humectants.\n\nIf you wanna go a step further and go super saiyan, and you aren't sensitive to lanolin, you can use [**Lasinoh Lanolin**](https://www.target.com/p/lansinoh-hpa-lanolin-tube/-/A-92544) before or after Aquaphor. I can't stand the smell of lanolin, but this one is medical-grade and doesn't have a smell. Lanolin is SUPER helpful because of it's crazy humectant properties but it also acts as an occlusive.\n\nFor just uber **Panthenol** healing, you can get something that stars it as the main star ingredient, like [**DML Forte Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/DML-Forte-Panthenol-4-Ounces/dp/B000052YN6/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1538872923&sr=8-3&keywords=forte+cream) or [**Timeless Skin Care Vitamin B5 Serum**](https://www.timelessha.com/products/vitamin-b5-serum-1-oz)**.** I don't use the cream anymore, but I do still use the serum. It looks expensive, but if you get the refill sale, it's about $7/oz (this is the price for me in the U.S.). I HIGHLY recommend their [vitamin c, e, ferulic acid serum](https://www.timelessha.com/products/20-vitamin-c-e-ferulic-acid-serum-1-oz) as well when your skin can handle it. It works out to **about $8 an ounce** if you get it during refill sale. It stays good for a while in the fridge. I wrap it in foil to keep more light out and transfer some to a 1 oz dropper bottle for using it in my bathroom. It gives glow to your skin like ***NOTHING ELSE***, and boosts your sunscreen (the antioxidants slow the degradation of sunscreen ingredients) and has helped me with water retention. If you can't get it on refill sale, use the HotandFlashy (I also recommend her Youtube channel) code hf5off to get $5 off. It's a forever coupon code.\n\n**Urea** is **SO, SO,** **SO** helpful for healing dehydrated skin. It's an amazing humectant but also a mild exfoliator if you have a high enough %. [**Eucerin 5% Urea Face Cream**](https://us.feelunique.com/p/eucerin-dry-skin-replenishing-face-cream-night-5-urea-50ml?utm_source=googlebaseus&utm_medium=gen&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi4cftgp3z3qivc39-ch3qhgiheakyaiabegjud_d_bwe&gclsrc=aw.ds&curr=USD) is awesome for this. I don't use that anymore simply because it's more of a hassle to get (not available in the U.S.). My skin looks AMAZING with the [**TriDerma MD Eczema Fast Healing Cream**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991) used as a sleeping pack. It's full of skin-healing goodies, like urea (of course), 1.5% Colloidal Oatmeal, aloe, allantoin, arnica extract (a flower thingy that helps heal wounds), beeswax (beeswax and lecithin have great skin-identical components much like ceramides), shea butter, zinc and sodium PCA, and squalane.\n\n**Squalane** is another skin-identical ingredient that you can incorporate into your skin care. I use [this](https://www.timelessha.com/products/squalane-100-pure) one for now, but you can also get the oil at [gardenofwisdom.com](https://gardenofwisdom.com) or [lotioncrafter.com](https://lotioncrafter.com). The GoW one is a little bit more thinner more astringent-feeling to me for some reason than Timeless's.\n\nAnd while you're at it, mix in some other healing oils that help heal skin. Linoleic acid is very important in skin health and wound healing. Oils that tend to be high in these go off faster, however. So you may want to keep them in the fridge. Add in 1% mixed tocopherols (vitamin e) to extend the shelf life of your oils. I like hemp seed, wheatgerm, chamomile/calendula, rosehip oils (can aggravate acne if you're acne-prone). My choice of oils for my facial oil serum: 50% borage seed oil (the best healing), 29% squalane oil, 10% seabuck thorn BERRY oil (very different fatty acid profile to the seed oil), and 10% pomegranate (filled with antioxidants), 1% mixed tocopherols.\n\nSomething that really helps is layering a ton of humectants/watery steps in my routine. You can experiment with this, but right now I'm using the Thayers witch hazel, my vitamin c serum, timeless vitamin b5 serum, [**innisfree aloe gel**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Innisfree-Aloe-Revital-Soothing-Gel-300ml/302699871225?epid=4002960484&hash=item467a517bf9:g:gy4AAOSwsTday~0A) (unscented, aloe, centella stuff), CosRX Snail, and Hadalabo Premium. I plan to get [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495) (way cheaper on eBay- like \\~$12).\n\nYou don't **need** a shit load of expensive things to heal dehydrated skin. In fact, a lot of the expensive stuff I see are filled with tons of unnecessary, possibly skin irritating plant extracts and essential oils, super fragranced. Many people go, oh it's fine bc it doesn't irritate my skin, but it's not just \"I'm sensitive to this\" vs \"I'm not\". It's likely that you can develop an allergy or sensitivity to a certain ingredient the longer you use it.  Like how some people develop sensitivity to latex after using eyelash glue with it in it for a while, or people developing sensitivity with lavender after prolonged exposure to the essential oil or something.\n\nAnyway, I hope that was helpful to anyone out there who struggled like I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: Also, I realized throughout my journey and research, a lot of things that look like \"break outs\", pimples, acne, aren't actually acne. Yeah, you can have acne due to bacteria or fungus or whatever else, but the stuff I'm talking about isn't really acne. Inflammation doesn't just manifest as rashes and thelike. A lot of things that look like acne are actually your skin saying \"no, this is irritating! Get it off me!\", like after you try a new thing for example. But that doesn't mean it will irritate it forever. You can use things that used to irritate your skin after your barrier heals. But some things you may be sensitive to forever..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDITED TO ADD 06/26/2019: AMINO ACIDS are also very important! They make up 40% of our stratum corneum (according to Susan from swiftcraftymoney)! If you want to fix your barrier, you want ingredients like amino acids, sodium PCA, sodium lactate, urea, and sugars like glycerin, fructose, what-have-you! For fatty acids, you want things like linoleic acids, oleic acids, and linolenic acids. Beeswax, lecithin, and lanolin are all great for rebuilding your barrier.\n\nI have not tried this, but The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA is a really good product with all of these NMFs. A pricy one is Paula's Choice Omega+ Complex (the serum, the moisturizer is okay too, but the serum has a lot more skin rebuilding goodies).",

The Triderma cream is really \"strong\" for a lack of a better description.. I normally used Aveeno Eczema therapy cream or CeraVe but the innisfree gel & cosrx snail essence makes them pill. I'm gonna switch out those two for something else because I love those creams and would like to have the choice to use it.\n\nThe La Roche Posay cleanser actually washes off clean, unlike the CeraVe Hydrating.\n\n(For people who are worried about parabens and hydroquinone, there is no need, we eat FAR more parabens and hydroquinone than we would ever put on our skin. Hydroquinone is not \"banned\" in other countries. It's just prescription-only because it's a very strong active so governments decided that people will need to use it under a doctor's supervision to avoid abuse.)",

The only thing to keep in mind is if you have allergies or sensitivities - Aveeno is always suggested but as someone who realized when I got older I was actually allergic to oats/oatmeal, I couldn’t tolerate it! I remember being a child, growing up with eczema and my parents would make me get into that Aveeno bath that I would have the worst reaction to (they didn’t know how allergic I was to it). Urea also gave me a bad reaction when I test patched it. Anyways just a reminder to people to still test patch things! Cerave was probably the most helpful and healing moisturizer for my dry and sensitive skin.",

        "body": "hey this post is a few weeks old but hopefully you can help me a bit; im also a dumbass and i recently fucked up my skin with overexfoliation. i thought my skin was sensitive before, but holy cow, it was nothing compared to how its been the past few days. it feels dry and irritated in a way that it's never felt before (i'm typically oily/acne-prone but it seems very dehydrated now)\n\nat the moment, i can't seem to tolerate any sort of fragrance or alcohols (including fatty alcohols). i had a lot of moisturizing steps in my previous routine, but they all had fragrance of some sort,so today i went to square one and tried to start a new routine. i've tried a few cerave lotions before and they didn't work well for me, so today i picked up cetaphil moisturizer (face + body) but that seems to irritate me a bit too. \n\nSo right now, I'm using a hyaluronic acid serum, aquaphor, and carrier oils that are high in linoleic acid (I happened to have black currant seed and grapeseed oils; they've been sitting in the closet for awhile but they smell and feel fine... and I picked up some \\[toasted\\] pumpkin seed oil, but its made for cooking and i'm not sure if there's a noticeable difference between this and others marketed for skin/hair care...)\n\nOH, and what's been the most soothing has been putting honey (mixed with a carrier oil) on my face. I picked up some vegetable glycerin to mix with the honey and I'm going to try that tomorrow. But as I've been trying to research this stuff, I've read some things about how using too much glycerin can make your skin drier? Honestly, I'm so overwhelmed and confused.\n\nI'd love to incorporate more moisture layers into my new routine, because I definitely feel like my moisture barrier is damaged and I'm trying not to freak out. I'm hoping it won't take me super long to recover, since it's really just the past week that I went overboard and hurt my skin. But who knows, maybe I have made my skin upset over time with fragrances and actives over time :/\n\nhow did you go about introducing new products when your issue started? I want to start using the cetaphil moisturizer if possible, and other products with ceramides, urea, etc etc BUT i can't seem to find any that are totally free from the ingredients that seem to be irritating me now... I dont want to buy products that will just sting and irritate me further, but I also don't want to prolong healing by not giving my skin everything it needs?\n\nsorry this is so long ashdsgkhflj thank you if you read this far\n\nEdit/update: I can tolerate the cetaphil Moisturizer now and it helps me feel hydrated, but I’ve started breaking out with some whiteheads, which is atypical for me (usually I get cystic pimples and CCs)",

    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories.

Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk.

I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time. It's really thick and is really tacky on my face. It doesn't have a \\~nice sillicone-y feel\\~. It absorbs all the way by morning tho when I slug life with it.

I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%.

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Hi Reddit, I’m an ICU doctor and wanted a second opinion on some concepts that are often repeated in medicine/biochemistry, but I can’t find a good explanation for – they both involve lactate/“lactic acid”. I have posted this on more than one subreddit to canvas a wider range of thoughts.\n\n**1. Anaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid**  \nThis has been drummed into me since I was a medical student, but the more I read into it the less sense it makes. Glycolysis functionally converts glucose into two pyruvic acids (which dissociate into pyruvate and H+, as both pyruvic acid has a very low pKa's relative to physiological pH)  \nInput: Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi  \nOutput: 2 Pyruvate + 2 H+ + 2 NADH + 2 ATP (from the combining of ADP and Pi)\n\nIn the absence of oxygen to facilitate oxidative phosphorylation, lactic acid fermentation via lactate dehydrogenase then converts pyruvate into lactate and NAD+ ; this consumes an H+ ion in the process  \nInput: Pyruvate + H+ + NADH  \nOutput: Lactate + NAD+\n\n**NOTE: this is lactate, NOT lactic acid - it is true that lactic acid dissociates to lactate and H+ at physiological pH, however pyruvate appears to be converted into lactate directly**\n\nSo combining both steps gives us the net equation of:  \nInput: Glucose + 2 NAD+ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi  \nOutput: Lactate + 2 NAD+ + 2 ATP  \nThe NAD+'s effectively cancel out for the overall equation to be:  \nGlucose + 2 ADP + 2 Pi -> Lactate + 2 ATP\n\nIn effect, the H+ generated by glycolysis is consumed by the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, with NO net acid generation. So why do we constantly refer to \"lactic acidosis\"?\n\nI am aware of the Stewart model (which is controversial in its own right), whereby any negative charge should cause acidosis due to a change in the strong ion difference. Is this then the only mechanism by which acidosis is caused by lactate? Does that mean that lactate is equally acidotic as any negatively charged substance (eg: albumin, phosphate etc)?\n\n**2. Lactate metabolism yields bicarbonate**  \nThis is an often repeated \"fact\" in medicine, which I cannot find any clear explanation of. Fluids such as Lactated Ringer's/Hartmanns specifically add 28mmol of sodium lactate to them, because the lactate is supposedly converted to bicarbonate.\n\nThe two most commonly proposed mechanisms (though they are only mentioned superficially) involve pyruvate and the Kreb's cycle, and are:\n\n1. Lactate is converted to pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase, then the pyruvate takes part in the Kreb's cycle, which consumes H+ (and thus effectively increases bicarbonate)\n2. Lactate is converted to pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase, then the pyruvate takes part in the Kreb's cycle, which produces CO2 ; CO2 is then converted to bicarbonate due to the carbonic acid buffering system\n\nNeither of these mechanisms make any sense to me  \n\\- As stated above, the reverse equation of lactate dehydrogenase is Lactate + NAD+ -> Pyruvate + H+ + NADH ; the conversion to pyruvate already produces an extra H+ ion  \n\\- The Kreb's cycle produces H+ for the electron transport chain ; I cannot see any evidence of H+ being consumed (and thus bicarbonate being created)  \n\\- The carbonic acid buffering system is CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 -> H+ + HCO3 ; while bicarbonate is increased by CO2, so is H+, so the effect should cancel out\n\nIn fact, lactate's conversion to pyruvate and then CO2 looks like it should produce 2 H+ ions and 1 bicarbonate, which would represent net acid \\*production\\* from the metabolism of lactate.\n\nI feel like I must be missing something here. Does anyone have an explanation for how lactate generates bicarbonate, or how lactate causes acidosis?\n\n======================================================================\n\n**UPDATE: Thanks all for the replies. The most comprehensive answer for point 1 is from** u/DbeID's link ([**Tox and Hound article by Steven Curry**](https://toxandhound.com/toxhound/ff-lactic-acidosis/))\n\nThe brief summary (which is similar to what some other posters mentioned):  \n\\- ATP hydrolysis produces net H+- Glycolysis produces net H+ ions ; these are removed by conversion of pyruvate to lactate  \n\\- When oxygen is available, oxidative phosphorylation via ATP synthase consumes H+ ions ; it is impossible to give a definitive number of how many are consumed due to an excess of variables, but experimentally it has been shown that it consumes almost all the H+ generated from ATP hydrolysis/glycolysis/Kreb's cycle ; when oxygen is available, the net acid production of all the processes is \\~0  \n\\- When oxygen is unavailable, ATP hydrolysis continues to generate H+ ions and thus causes a metabolic acidosis  \n\\- Glycolysis is allosterically regulated by levels of Pi/AMP/ADP, and inhibited by ATP ; when oxygen is unavailable, it is accelerated and ends up producing additional lactate  \n\\- Thus when oxygen is unavailable, lactate levels rise and ATP hydrolysis generates net H+ ions and thus acidosis ; the acidosis is correlated with lactate, but not caused by lactate  \n\\- This correlation is NOT 1:1 ; lactate and H+ both have ways to leave the cell independently, so it is possible to have high lactate transport without high H+ transport and vice-versa  \n\\- Additionally, there is a separate equilibrium of lactate:pyruvate to maintain the redox potential of NADH/NAD+ ; this explains situations where lactate is elevated despite normal oxidative phosphorylation (eg: ethanol), and situations where oxidative phosphorylation is impaired without a rise in lactate (eg: salicylate poisoning)\n\nI unfortunately have not found a clear answer for point 2 re: the metabolism of lactate to bicarbonate, though. I was wrong regarding the location of lactate's conversion to pyruvate, and u/Calciphylaxis' explanation of why it should primarily occur in the liver via the Cori cycle seems correct. They also have the only proposal regarding bicarbonate conversion so far:\n\n>Your next question: How does lactate metabolism generate bicarbonate if Lactate + NAD+ —> Pyruvate + NADH + H+??  \nSo it’s not as simple as looking at the equation in reverse.  \nPyruvate —> Lactate happens in the cytosol of the cell (ie muscle).   \nLactate —> Pyruvate happens in hepatocyte mitochondria at the intermembrane space. \\[Cori Cycle\\]  \nThis means that the H+ that is generated by lactate oxidation in the hepatocyte mitochondria will not contribute to blood pH; it is instead used as part of the Proton Motive Force for subsequent ATP hydrolysis.   \nThere will be an H+ that is consumed as well by the formation of NADH. Consumed H+ = generation of bicarbonate.\n\nI still don't understand this, and the next questions would be:  \n\\- If the produced H+ doesn't contribute to blood pH because it is in the hepatocyte mitochondria, how come a net consumption of H+ within the mitochondria (wherever it occurs) does contribute to blood pH?  \n\\- As mentioned above, it appears that the overall process of oxidative phosphorylation will \\~exactly balance the protons generated from ATP hydrolysis/glycolysis/Kreb's cycle. Lactate generates H+ when it is turned back into pyruvate, which could feasibly be canceled out by the above process - but it would need to consume an \\*additional\\* H+ to cause the 1:1 conversion to bicarbonate that is often claimed  \n\\- A side question: it is also frequently claimed that citrate metabolism produces 3 bicarbonates for every 1 citrate, with a similar mechanism to lactate metabolism cited ; how does citrate metabolism produce bicarbonate in this 1\\`:3 ratio?",

        "body": "Yeah, you're absolutely right to question the age-old \"anaerobic metabolism caused lactate\". Yeah, that's one cause, but lactate metabolism is very complicated (and I'd be lying if I said I had my head around it completely). I think \"anerobic metabolism\" is the case in ischaemic gut. This is not the cause when you give an asthmatic lots of salbutamol or run a patient on an adrenaline infusion. Beta adrenergic stimulation shunts metabolism towards lactate production because it is a great fuel source.  My understanding is that skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle can utilise lactate effectively (which would make sense from an evolutionary perspective when we have an adrenaline surge to deal with physical life-threats--You would want as much fuel as possible for your heart and lungs). You might also have noticed the small population of septic shock patients that never mounted a lactate rise--This may be in part to lack of endogenous adrenaline.  These patients tend to have a worse prognosis (?because they have already utilised all their endogenous catecholamines by presentation?). And other tox/metabolic changes can lead to lactate production.  For example, chronic alcohol abuse leads to a relative NAD+ deficiency, which leads to poor lactate metabolism. And thiamine deficiency can also lead to elevated lactate levels (I think, but I'm not 100% sure, that thiamine is a coenzyme for pyruvate metabolism down an alternative pathway, so pyruvate gets preferentially metabolised to lactate in the absence of thiamine).  Interestingly, at altitude (aka hypoxic conditions), you produce less lactate in response to exercise than you do at sea level--Which really throws a spanner in the works of traditional teaching. \n\nBasically the \"anaerobic metabolism causes lactate production\" is an inaccurate and oversimplified version that seemed to explain the elevated lactate we found in shock and with ischaemic gut, but we're learning that our metabolism is complicated and adaptable. As we should have expected in a key energy source in a complex biological system. \n\n\nI can't shed any light on the lactate being metabolised to bicarbonate. To be honest, I don't remember hearing that (but I might not have paid that much attention in biochem and it was a while ago now). That statement seems to imply that lactate should cause a metabolic alkalosis if clearance isn't impaired/production isn't too high, which doesn't make a lot of sense. Mild acidosis like we see with intensive exercise shifts the Hb-oxygenation curve such that we offload oxygen more easily to tissues (which is what we want when we are exercising). Having the opposite process when there is a mild increase in lactate production or a post-exercise alkalosis doesn't make sense to me.",

    "body": "Welcome!\n\nThis is a new series I am going to be working on where I endeavour to cover various topics in physiology intermixed with clinical pearls to impart some knowledge that doctors of most specialties and grades will hopefully find useful when looking after acutely unwell patients. Join me as we dredge through the depths of anaesthetic exam revision to answer important questions like \"why do CT ask for a pink cannula\", \"why frusemide is okay to give in AKI\", \"why is hypoxic drive a bunch of horse manure\" and many more. Pick up some of this material and you'll be well on your way to becoming a pernickety anaesthetist, whether you like it or not! \n\nQuestions, comments, feedback, and suggestions are both encouraged and welcome.\n\n---------------------\n\n# IV access, resuscitation, fluids, and the cardiovascular system\n\nThis topic is near and dear to my heart because cannulae and fluids are extremely common interventions in virtually all inpatients that we see, yet there is much misunderstood in general. By the end you will hopefully understand why anaesthetists roll their eyes at pink cannulas in the ACF, why normal blood pressure does not mean the patient doesn't require resuscitation, and why normal saline is the devil.\n\nI do also appreciate that the more junior you are, the less influence you'll have on decision making, and you may just be following the commands of your seniors. Which is understandable, but you will eventually end up in their position and engraining good practice requires you to be exposed to such, not just the willy nilly nonsense of that senile consultant.\n\n## Why do they need a cannula?\n\nSo this is pretty obvious question, but it merits discussion because I don't think we question it enough whether or not the patient really *needs* a cannula in the first place.\n\nDo they actually need IV fluids? Are they able to tolerate PO intake, if so, giving them IV fluids round the clock, especially overnight, is unnecessary and will just wake them up needing to pee. Remember the GI and renal systems are excellent at regulating fluid balance, so IV is not necessarily better, especially if you're just running saline. Equally, oral paracetamol has excellent bioavailability and can likely be administered faster than the setup required for putting in a cannula and giving set. It is also much cheaper and several studies have found it to be [non-inferior](https://emj.bmj.com/content/35/3/179) in terms of efficacy and need for rescue analgesia in many situations.\n\nThe reasons for doing so will also determine what size of cannula you'd want to use. A pink (20G) is the trusty default by most people for most things, but if your patient is acutely unwell, hypotensive and needs fluids and/or blood products, you should go for a bigger cannula (at least green (18G)). I also don't think any acute surgical admission should get less than a green either. And we'll move onto why this is.\n\n## Cannula sizes and flow rates\n \nNow I won't teach you guys to suck eggs, we all know how colour corresponds with gauge and that bigger = quicker liquidy stuff. But do you know *how much* quicker? Recall the [Hagen-Poiseuille equation](https://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=100482) that flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius and inversely proportional to length (applies only to laminar flow and Newtonian fluids, which includes most situations in this context).\n\nThis means that a grey cannula has more than double the flow rate of a green despite being only just over 30% wider. Indeed, two greens are the same as one grey by comparison, so if there are veins you're better off ensuring multiple reliable routes rather than screw up a big cannula by being too adventurous.  It also means that a green peripheral cannula is far better than the 18G lumen of the central line because the length drastically reduces flow rates. Hence during resuscitation a wide bore peripheral cannula is often better than a central line. Depending on the purchasing stock of your local trust, it may also mean an 18G isn't actually much speedier than a 20G if the 20G is much shorter in length than the 18G. Equally, multiple [studies](https://emj.bmj.com/content/35/9/550) have found that longer cannulae are less likely to tissue thus longer isn't always worse, depending on why/how long you need it.\n\nThese explain why radiographers dislike using small cannulae. The flow rates are significantly smaller despite being only 'one size' down and the mixing of contrast and its appearance during scan is also thus delayed. This can mean the images are suboptimal and therefore your clinical question gets a much woolier answer of \"allowing for suboptimal study, there are no large volume pulmonary emboli\". They're not trying to be difficult, there is a reason why big cannulae are necessary for an optimal study (also, pressure ratings for things like PICC lines and CVCs preclude some being used for contrast lest it literally blow the plastic apart).\n\n## Cannula locations\n\nThis is a minor point but often a grievance by anaesthetists. I don't know who teaches cannulation skills in medical school these days, but novices still have a predilection for ACF cannulae for some reason. I get that you feel a big vein and it often is less painful than going to the back of the hand, but consider the efficacy of your therapy. As an awake patient flexes their elbow picking up a drink (thus the importance of enquiring about dominance) the catheter often kinks and gets blocked. Unless the nurse is constantly by the bedside this means infusion pumps will alarm and stop. That blood transfusion you think the patient is getting is not actually happening. Like it or not, to get the treatment you envisage you do need to think about practical aspects if you care about more than just documentation.\n\nThe ACF also has a much greater capacity to absorb fluid so it will take longer to notice a cannula has tissued than in more tissue sparse areas such as the back of the hand. So avoid it when and if you can. An frequent recommendation to search for a vein is the so called 'houseman's vein'. This is a vein found on the lateral aspect of the wrist as is often of good calibre. Equally, a top physiology tip is to tap the vein multiple times as if you were percussing for MRCP, this causes the release of nitric oxide and will dilate the veins well to improve your options. I would urge caution, however, if your patient is surgical. Please do not shove tiny cannulae into large veins as this diminishes our ability to put in larger ones once the patient is asleep. I'd rather a pink in the ACF than you to use the only dorsal vein for an equally shitty one (sorry not sorry for the judgement).\n\n## Resuscitation, resuscitation, resuscitation\n\nIf your patient is septic and hypotensive, there is, generally, an acceptance that they need *some* fluid, although how much to give is certainly up for debate. Whilst the [2021 Surviving Sepsis](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Fulltext/2021/11000/Surviving_Sepsis_Campaign__International.21.aspx) guidelines advocate for 30mL/kg within the first three hours, I doubt many intensivists would encourage this practice as a first line single bolus. Now in a 70kg adult this translates to a little over 2L, which isn't all that much, and I agree the evidence is poor, but the key point here is titrating to effect: small but frequent boluses *if they're doing something*. ie) You need to measure the response to your intervention (such as by blood pressure) and not keep repeating the action if it's doing nothing. A fair gauge to responsiveness is to do a straight leg raise as this causes an increase in venous return by a somewhat similar amount. Though, paradoxically, you can enter a situation where there is no response because you've not given *enough*, but I'd argue this isn't all that common and you need to, as always, apply in context. 80 year old Doris is going to tolerate and require far less volume than 20 year old Mike.\n\nA point to address here which I expand on [elsewehere](https://www.reddit.com/r/JuniorDoctorsUK/comments/phpzpx/when_your_patient_with_pulmonary_oedema_becomes/hbl92mx/) but the ultimate point is that you need to assess the fluid balance as well as your patient's position on the [frank-starling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Starling_law) when making decision about fluids. A patient's comorbidities can and do affect where they lie on this curve so your intervention can be as harmful as it is useful. Not that it's easy to make the assessment, but you do need to at least think about it. The physiologically older your patient is, the less well they're likely to tolerate a fluid load and the earlier you should get in touch with ITU for consideration of vasopressors (as appropriate). There isn't always a single or right thing to do, sometimes you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't. The important thing is in knowing the position you're in and merely trying your best.\n\nFluids need to be given as well as prescribed. You may not care that the pump is alarming or there is just a blue cannula, simply prescribing stuff does not absolve you of responsibility to ensure the therapy is able to be administered. As discussed above, you need large bore access for this. In an ideal world you'll squeeze the fluid bag yourself to allow it to go in quickly, as pumps are often limited to 1000mL/hr - which is *not* a bolus (if your cannula can do 100mL/min like a green, that's a 250mL bolus in 2.5 mins). Real world scenarios may make this difficult, but allowing a litre to drip in over a few hours is not going to do the trick either, so please assess your patient properly and take appropriate action. Do not just leave them sitting in resus for the parent team to manage.\n\nThe final point here is about the young and the generally well. This patient population compensates extremely well. They will be normotensive despite being septic as fuck™, so do not presume their normal blood pressure means they do not require fluids or intervention. If they're tachycardic, it's because of sepsis and not anxiety. Especially if these patients are trauma/major haemorrhage or surgical ones. If they are likely to come anywhere near an anaesthetic, their resuscitation matters even more. If you give these patients a sniff of an anaesthetic you will destroy their sympathetic response and they will collapse completely. I won't delve into the cardiovascular effects of positive pressure ventilation, but, suffice it to say, patients need to be adequately resuscitated before we intubate them if we want them to stay alive. And you can help with that whether you're in ED, medicine, or surgery. A definitive airway isn't always the first priority.\n \n## Your choice of fluid matters\n \nThis is one of those things that I know is limited by availability. If your medical ward only has normal saline, what can you do about it, I'm not saying give no fluids. But wherever possible, and especially in ED, do not just presume that saline is equivalent and harmless. It's not. It definitely does lead to hyperchloraemic acidosis, and remember the impact of acidaemia: it makes adrenal receptors less sensitive towards catecholamines, as well as [preferring the shift of potassium out of cells and increasing its renal resorption](https://www.seminarsinnephrology.org/article/S0270-9295\\(13\\)00055-7/fulltext). You are actively causing harm by using 'normal' saline. It is anything but normal.\n \nSo, what are your options? Well, basically anything so called 'balanced' which has electrolytes closer to physiological variables. In most UK hospitals that will mean Hartmann's (compound sodium lactate) or Plasmalyte (which has acetate as opposed to lactate and magnesium but no calcium as compared to Hartmann's). Lest you think I'm being purely academic, there is increasing evidence ([SALT-ED](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1711586) and [SMART](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1711584) trials) that 'normal' saline can cause harm even in non-critically ill patients. If it's not much trouble, spend the effort to get the better fluid. \n\nThe final things to mention, which I often see concerns about, are the potassium or lactate content of Hartmann's. Lest you be worried about this, these are not harmful. The lactate in Hartmann's (which is conjugated to sodium and *not* the lowly proton) is physically *unable* to cause acidaemia, and by its conversion to bicarbonate in the blood only serves to provide a positive effect in acidotic patients (ie, increasing their pH). It has also found to [improve resolution of acidosis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jpc.13436) in DKA for that matter. Equally, by improving the pH the miniscule potassium content of Hartmann's is of no danger and only [advantageous in hyperkalaemic patients](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/myth-busting-lactated-ringers-is-safe-in-hyperkalemia-and-is-superior-to-ns/).\n\nWhilst serum lactate levels can rise transiently (especially in patients with significantly reduced liver function), this is largely speaking irrelevant because, as mentioned before, the lactate does not contribute to acidaemia. Whilst theoretically it *could* confuse your assessment, the rest of the clinical picture should be more than enough for you to discern whether any acidaemia is being contributed to by lactate (and the source of the lactate whether hypoperfusion/hypoxia, etc).\n\n## A few final words\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you, I hope this has been somewhat useful. I have tried to avoid being the hoity toity anaesthetist grandstanding in their ivory tower, but I appreciate I don't always have insight. I do try to understand that best practice can often conflict with directions from seniors and practicability and make allowances for such. I try not to look down on practices limited by these, there's only so much an individual can do. But in some way try to encourage some deeper thinking so that when you get round to making the decisions, you are drawing from the depths of your knowledge and not teaching needless dogma to the next generation.",

The study design is problematic i.e., randomising fluid administration by month, rather than for an individual. Whilst baseline characteristics of each group are fine as shown, there are going to be differences in presenting pathologies, staff attitudes knowing this is the saline vs balanced crystalloid month, time related capacity issues etc.\n\nDespite these biases, neither trial shows any quantifiable benefit in a single metric - only a marginal (in both significance and magnitude) difference in a composite measure. This is to say, you cannot give a NNT to, say, prevent one death or one renal impairment.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that, despite intensivists/anaesthetists particular focus on this issue, is that NS and balanced crystalloid have similar outcomes, with benefit for balanced crystalloid only demonstrated with an at best marginal improvement on a composite outcome.",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

    "body": "Anyone on any form of social media knows about Lume Deodorant; their advertising is on point! I loved the catchy commercials, positive reviews, and had been using natural deodorants for years so I thought why the heck not?!? I've been using for 2+ months and felt it was time to write about my experience. I'm a big believer in honesty and transparency and my biggest criticism of this product/company is the inability to leave an unbiased review, even/especially if it's negative; the company never posted my less than stellar review on their website so I'm taking it to this forum. Underarms are skin too!\n\nI purchased the 3oz Lume Unscented Deodorant in the tube for $19USD. I've used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and I still have some left. It's vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, and baking-soda fee. It's a mandelic acid based product. In the past I've used Schmidt's Original and Sensitive, Native, and an independent Etsy brand. All but Native worked well for odor but eventually they all irritated my pits to different degrees\n\n**PRO** \n\n* The first positive I will say is that it never irritated my pits, even directly after shaving. It's safe to use anywhere the gets stinky but I only have used on my underarms.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* DISHONEST PRACTICES As I mentioned before, I think the company promotes skewed product reviews by omitting critical reviews. This is not cool by me.\n* INEFFECTIVE- Guys, nobody wanted this product to work more than me. I don't have a strong body odor but my underarms will get stinky if I don't use anything. I don't care about getting sweaty (this is not an antiperspirant) but this really didn't work well to control odor. The company is very upfront that to use the product effectively, your clothes need to be treated first to wash off residual bacteria and residue from former products. I bought their recommended detergent and treated all my clothing as directed; nope, still stinky. I repeated the clothing treatments multiples times without results hoping it would work. At that point, I was past the 30 day return window. I bought a few new (washed) shirts and still experienced odor so I think the washing is kind of BS. Some days it would work better than others but it def didn't live up to the 72 hour odor control the company claims. It'll work well for a few hours but after that...phew. My body actually has a different, worse scent when I use this product. \n* \"UNSCENTED\"  is more like...old bananas. It mostly fades but kind of off-putting.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nWater, Mandelic Acid, Arrowroot Powder, Tapioca Starch, Isoamyl Laurate, Sodium Acrylate/ Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Caffeine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Isohexadecane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 60, Lecithin, Pullulan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Silica, Fragrance\\*",

    "body": "Hey guys!\n\n Soo thanks to /u/the_acid_queen and /u/holysnails I was inspired a few months ago to take the leap and stop just reading about DIY and just DO IT. Two massive orders from Lotioncrafter later (as well as various smaller ones from GoW and Amazon), I can definitely say I'm hooked. **But I really want to emphasize that despite countless hours spent on /u/DIYbeauty, Chel and Alli's blog, Susan Barclay's blog Point of Interest, and many other resources as well as practice I am very much a beginner. It takes a long long time to really master DIY skincare because when it comes down to it, it really is a science. If you're not fully prepared to do your research, buy the right equipment and supplies, and proceed with the utmost caution then don't bother. There are countless amazimg ready made products out there for you. If you are prepared though, AWESOME. Let's get started.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPhew. Now that that's out of the way, I just wanted to say that I never even thought to post about this until now because (1 I didn't think anyone would be interested and 2) what could I possibly have to teach someone? All the interest in the recent post on DIY made me realize that this is a topic you guys want to hear about and I started to think that maybe my perspective as a beginner could be valuable. So I'll be posting some easy peasy beginner recipes below which are a great starting point.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supplies and getting started**\n\nI highly recommend [this post](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/) from Alli at her blog The Acid Queen, it lists all the measuring and mixing supplies you'll need, some info on preparing your work area, and a great beginner's essence recipe. She wrote this after I'd already gotten started with DIY but I had picked her brain via email on stuff to get so I can testify that she's spot on with her list. If you don't have a kitchen mixer and don't want to spend the money on one, you can get a stick blender for under $10 which Susan from POI recommends. I got the Mini Mixer from Lotioncrafter for $20. You can even buy those little miniature kitchen whisks off Amazon if you're making something without an oil phase but you'll definitely want an electrical mixer once you move onto to formulations where you're combining water and oil phases. Also, I use [this scale] (http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-0-01g-Digital-Scale/dp/B0012LOQUQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461054126&sr=8-1&keywords=American+Weigh+100g+x+0.01g+Digital+Scale+by+American+Weigh) which Chel recommended on her blog. It's under $10 and it's great, just get the 100g calibration weight.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as actual ingredients, I highly recommend Lotioncrafter. They have excellent customer service and fair prices. While you might be able to shop around and get better prices on some things, the quality might not be there. I feel comfortable vouching for Lotioncrafter because I know their ingredients are good qualify. Other places you can check out are Bulk Actives, Ingredients to Die For, and Skin Actives. I use GoW for oils but they also have other ingredients. In the past Chel has linked the Taiwanese site Skin Essential Actives on her blog but just a heads up, I've heard lots of reports of really poor service recently.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for as WHICH ingredients, that's going to depend on you and what you want to make. I would browse Point of Interest to get an idea of which ingredients you'll need for which kinds of recipes. Off the top of my head my first order I believe I got... distilled water, aloe vera juice, hydrosols, glycerin, propylene or butylene glycol, hylauronic acid, MAP, niacinamide, NAG, various extracts, oils, emulsifying wax, a preservative and a few others. Basically you need your water phase (distilled water is totally fine but I like to use aloe and hydrosols too), your oil phase (oils and then an emulsifier if you're combining oil and water), some goodies for your skin (humectants, extracts, niacinamide, Vitamin C, etc), and preservative. **Preservatives are NOT optional**. The only time you don't need one is of your product contains only oils and no water. It's okay to get cheap stuff like aloe juice, sodium lactate or PCA, hydrosols, glycerin, etc. You can stick them in everything and still get good results. Oh and get a complete emulsifier, like BTMS-50, Lotionpro, Ecomulse, or E Wax so you don't have to mess with the HLB system. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Beginner Recipes**\n\nOkay, if you got through all that we can finally get started lol. These are all super easy recipes that I've made before. I'm going to stick to stuff relevant to AB but if there's interest I'd be happy to post some more complex stuff I've made as well as other beginner friendly recipes as well. The first three don't container water so there's no preservative needed and you can just heat till melted through. The cleansing water though requires a preservative and you need to heat and hold for 20 minutes (see Alli's blog for more info on that).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH VASELINE\n\n*50% Vaseline (petroleum jelly)*\n\n*24% light oil (I used grape seed)*\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% IPM*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients, combine, and heat. Melt and stir until melted through. Allow to cool then whip and transfer to jar. You can fancy it up by adding .5% of an essential oil or using a mix of oils for the 24% oils. Castor oil is a great oil to use in any cleansing oil or balm due to it's cleansing products. You don't want to use expensive oils because they're just getting washed off so you want to select affordable oils that have some slip so they work well when you're massaging your face. I chose light oils to lighten up the Vaseline and the IPM (Isopropyl Myristate, it's an ester) really reduces that greasy feeling.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING BALM WITH E WAX\n\n*96.5% heavier oils (I used rice brand, apricot kernel, and avocado)*\n\n*2.5% emulsifying wax*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeight out ingredients, combine, and heat. Again, stir until melted through and allow to cool. Whip until smooth and scrape into jar. So again feel free to do a mix of oils if you want to make it more complex. Some tea tree oil would make it a little astringent or you can use something nourishing like carrot seed essential oil.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBTW, [here](http://m.imgur.com/a/nIUN2) are some pictures of how they turned out when I made both versions the other day just for fun. I made these two just because that's what I had on hand to create a cleansing oil that was a balm consistency. I'll be ordering some more stuff soon and making a cleansing balm with more of the same ingredients as many AB balms and will update then.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING OIL RECIPE\n\n*84-89% oils (whatever you prefer)\n\n*10-15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*1% Vitamin E (optional, extends the shelf life of oils)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWeigh out ingredients into bottle and then shake. Done. This isn't even really a recipe, it's common knowledge but I think I'd include it for anyone who didn't know. If you want it to wash off cleanly, use 15% Cromollient. If you want some moisterizing effects use 10% Cromollient. Then adjust the oils to make sure your total is 100%. Just use this as a base and tweak it to suit your needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDIY CLEANSING WATER\n\n*74% water (I used a mix of aloe vera juice and distilled water)\n\n*15% Cromollient SCE*\n\n*10% glycerin*\n\n*1% germaben (or other preservative of your choice at suggested amount)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCombine ingredients, heat at 70C for 20 minutes, then bottle. The preservative gets added once it's cooling down and if you used any extracts or heat sensitive ingredients you'd add them then too. I ran out of my Simple Micellar Water and figured I'd just make my own instead of paying $10 at CVS for another bottle. This is really easy to modify too. Because you're using a cotton pad with it and it's staying on your skin, it's not a waste to add extracts and other fun stuff. You can use a hydrosol instead or in addition to the aloe vera juice. I'm almost done with my first tester batch and I'll be adding niacinamide and chamomile extract to the next one to make it more like the Simple one. If you add anything just subtract it from the water so you still total 100%. I would keep some distilled water in there to keep it from feeling sticky.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm going to end it here because this is already insanely long. Let me know in the comments if you'd like me to do another post on how I make my body oil, facial oil, PH adjusting toner mist, and brightening essence. I've made some serums but I used Shark Sauce as a base so I don't feel comfortable posting them but I'm working on a serum with MAP that I can share once I'm done tweaking it. And this week I'll be playing around with facial milks and sleeping packs so I can post those too. I just typed this all up super quick and on the spot so sorry if it's all crazy, might have to edit some.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products.

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories.

Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk.

It's finally healthy and normal - not irritated, red, flushed, spotty.\n\nI haven't had skin like this in 17 years.",

    "body": "Hello folks! So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before. But it's the FIRST affordable product that I came across that has high % of niacinamide AND  Acetyl glucosamine ---- not just those, but a small amount of supposedly the most powerful vitamin c derivative!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Niacinamide and NAG work synergistically together](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag) to be a brightening powerhouse as well as repairing your skin barrier. They help boost your ceramide production and NAG is skin-identical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**PHYSICIANS FORMULA SKIN BOOSTER - BRIGHTENING**](https://www.target.com/p/physicians-formula-skin-booster-vitamin-shot-brightening-1-fl-oz/-/A-75569193)  **$7.99/1 oz or 30ml**\n\n*Water, Butylene Glycol,* ***Niacinamide***\\*, Glycerin,\\* ***Acetyl Glucosamine***\\*, Pentylene Glycol, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium Edta, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Caesalpinia Spinosa Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate,\\* ***3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid***\\*, Iron Oxides (Ci 77492), Tocopheryl Acetate, Phenoxyethanol, Vegetable Collagen, Agar, Calcium Alginate, Xanthan Gum, Kappaphycus Alvarezii Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tropolone, Gluconolactone, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Red 30 (Ci 73360), Sodium Benzoate.\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it's an \"inspired\" product of [**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-niacinamide-booster/798.html)**:**\n\n*Water (Aqua),* ***Niacinamide*** *(vitamin B3, skin-restoring ),* ***Acetyl Glucosamine*** *(skin replenishing/antioxidant),* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside*** *(vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).*\n\nThe Paula's Choice obviously has more beneficial ingredients and higher % but still, it's **$44 for 0.67oz/20ml**.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

For the method I mostly followed [Acid Queen's](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/amp/) steps. The one ingredient that I substituted was Laureth-23 with Polysorbate 80 (a solublizer for vitamin e) because I just couldn't find it anywhere. I did most of my troubleshooting by reading other people's failures and experience making the Acid Queen's formulation on r/DIYBeauty . Honestly, r/DIYBeauty is simply a treasure trove especially on formulation of vitamin C serum. The final pH of my serum is 3.16 adjusted using Sodium Lactate.\n\nHowever what I wanted to discuss here is the total cost and whether DIYing the serum is worth it.\n\n**Ingredients**|**Percentage**|**Weight(gm)**|**Cost of ingredient**|**Cost/bottle**|**Seller**|**Cheaper place to order**\n:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:\nFerulic Acid|0.50%|0.15|765 for 5gm|22.95|SRL Chemicals|300 for 10gm at Skinfuel\nPropylene Glycol|10.00%|3|129.8 for 100gm|3.894|Vijay Impex|250 for 500gm at Skinfuel\n1% HA stock|15.00%|4.5|1200 for 10gm(MMW)|5.4|Artconnect|700 for 10gm at Skinfuel\nDistilled water|35.70%|10.71|Free| | | \nPanthenol|0.50%|0.15|236 for 25gm|1.416|VijayImpex| \nPolysorbate 80 |2.00%|0.6|118 for 100gm|0.708|VijayImpex| \nEthoxydiglycol|20.00%|6|529 for 500ml(495gm approx)|6.41|SRL Chemicals| \nTocopherol|1.00%|0.3|135.7 for 25ml( approx 24gm)|1.69|VijayImpex| \nLiquid Germall Plus|0.30%|0.09|250 for 25gm|0.9|Artconnect| \nL-Ascorbic Acid|15.00%|4.5|522 for 20gm|117.45|BeautyBay |503 for 100gm at SRL Chemicals\nSodium Lactate |Q.S for pH| |118 for 100gm| |VijayImpex| \n**Total** |**100.00%**|**30**|**4,003.5**|**160.818**| | \n\n**Additional Costs**\n\n* [Ph meter](https://www.amazon.in/NEXQUA-digital-meter-calibration-accessories/dp/B08JJLKFQ2/ref=asc_df_B08JJLKFQ2/?tag=googleshopmob-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397653841825&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11345605332900110399&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9299180&hvtargid=pla-1086875042858&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) ₹800\n* Beakers free\n* [Weighing scale](https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B01LPOZA2M?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image)₹279\n* Silicone Spatula ₹300 for 2\n* Isopropyl 70%(surgical spirit for sterilization) ₹120 for 400ml\n\nTo store the finished serum, I used an old The Ordinary amber bottle that I had sterilized.\n\n**Some Changes I will make next time**\n\n* Use TEA( triethanolamine) to adjust the pH. I needed quite a bit of Sodium Lactate to bring the pH up. This means that my final percentages may be slightly out of whack.\n* Use Liquorice root extract.\n\n**Finally is it worth it....**\nEven though I bought some of the chemicals at a higher rate, the final cost per bottle is definitely cheaper than the market alternatives. Having said that there is quite a bit of initial investment. I personally don't mind it because I have started making a lot of my own skincare serums and products and thus my initial investment is spread out over multiple products. \n\nNote: \n\n* If you'll decide to buy anything from Skinfuel and see that it is available only in larger volumes, ask her if she can give it to you in smaller. They are usually quite flexible in this regard.\n\n* The chemicals that I bought from SRL Chemicals are of the highest purity grade  i.e. even higher than cosmetic grade. Please don't buy the cheapest grade like Industrial grade because they may have inclusions that may not be skin safe.\nAlso forgive the formatting, I am typing this out on my phone.",

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!! Paula’s Choice is having 20% this weekend (on one product) so I am contemplating trying her vitamin c serum. I will be shy on free shipping though, and not sure what else to order lol.",

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Check out the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from AsianBeauty sub for other people's knowledge-bombs in the comment sections!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk.

I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time.

    "body": "Hi guys. :) I just thought I should share how I've been making my serums. I modified u/theacidqueen's [DIY Skinceuticals Vitamin C Dupe](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/) recipe for the vitamin C. She is brilliant.\n\nI usually make my serums at the same time. I will link where I got the ingredients and equipment, but you can get them from any source of your choice.\n\nThe reason I switched out the solvents is because when I made the serums with ethoxydiglycol and propylene glycol, I found them incredibly sticky (my eyelids were sticking together), a little greasy, and heavy-feeling. Ethoxydiglycol really helped to make the serum feel lighter to Ally (sorry if I misspelled) but to me, it made it feel much heavier/stickier. I guess that just goes to show you how subjective skin-feel and such are (could've been other factors too)!\n\nI wanted to share how these recipes worked out **for me** and talk about how effective they have been so far. I always see recipes and doing things right on DIY sources, but not how effective they are in practice. So I thought I would add that as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**=** [**PICTURES ON IMGUR.**](https://imgur.com/a/7zKLhoF) **=**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Materials Used (for both serums):**\n\n\\- 2\\~3 [weigh boats](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/weight-boats?_pos=9&_sid=a801f914b&_ss=r) *(to weigh powders)*\n\n\\- 3 [small scoops](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/Dispensing-Spoon_p_342.html)/any plastic spoons *(The ones I got from MC were too dang small, but great for very small test batches.)*\n\n\\- [Scale weighing to 0.01g](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6RE3A0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) *(I've had this for years and I love it.

Combine WATER PHASE into the bigger beaker.\n2. Weigh it, record the weight (the entire beaker + contents) on a piece of paper/flashcard.\n3. Put the silicone trivet into the flat pot and fill it up water. Then heat it to 70 °C.\n4. Take the smol 50ml beaker and fill it with some distilled water.\n5. Put them on top of the trivet and heat for \\~20 min. (Heat should be between 70-75 °C)\n6. Meanwhile, you can mix COOL DOWN PHASE in a different beaker.\n7. Take them out, weigh the bigger beaker. Subtract the new weight from the beginning weight.\n8. Take that much out of the smol 50ml beaker, add it to bigger beaker.\n9. Leave it til it reaches 50 °C.\n10. Pour the COOL DOWN PHASE mix into the bigger beaker and mix with mini mixer (or by hand).\n11. Test the pH, adjust to pH 6. (I used [citric acid](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/citric-acid?_pos=1&_sid=c2f3237c7&_ss=r) mixed with distilled water to lower, and triethanolamine to raise. I got triethanolamine at Lotioncrafter's but they no longer carry it. I read that you can use baking soda instead, or sodium hydroxide/lye. You can use sodium lactate too, but you would need asssssloads of it as it's a weak base.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes**\n\n\\- Makes a lightweight, very watery but slightly viscous, colorless serum. A bit tacky while drying down, but once absorbed fully, not tacky at all.\n\n\\- You can cold process this, but I've had better results hot processing it for whatever reason.\n\n\\- I definitely noticed a difference in how my skin looks using dimethyl isosorbide VS ethoxydiglycol + propylene glycol or propylene glycol alone, in all my other past iterations of this serum (it was a gel-cream at first). My skin looked brighter and a little smoother faster compared to the past recipes.\n\nThe reason you don't see this ingredient more in both DIY and in commercial products is because it's really expensive compared to glycols/alcohol. :\\[ I have only seen them in The Ordinary & Drunk Elephant, but some other high-end brands use it too apparently, according to INCIDecoder.\n\nI was frustrated that I wasn't getting the same results as commercial niacinamide serums with my cold processed gel-cream. But I'm finally seeing results. I find niacinamide *incredibly* helpful for keeping my super dry skin/skin barrier healthy. I love it most of all for how it smooths out my skin texture like I'm wearing a primer. It helps slowly fade PIH as well, but don't expect any miracles.\n\n\\- Don't be alarmed when the white powder doesn't dissolve and is chunky when you're making your HA stock. Just shake it a little and leave it overnight. It'll be clear and non-chunky in the morning! :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VITAMIN C SERUM**\n\n(The directions are pretty much from the original post.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*WATER PHASE*\n\n0.5% [ferulic acid](https://lotioncrafter.com/search?type=product&q=ferulic*)\n\n15% dimethyl isosorbide\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n15% hyaluronic stock\n\n50.2% distilled water\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*OIL PHASE*\n\n1% [tocopherol](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/vitamin-e-mixed-tocopherols-95?_pos=2&_sid=94731dbdb&_ss=r)\n\n3% [laureth-23](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/laureth-23?_pos=1&_sid=697dc4bd7&_ss=r)\n\n*(Next time, will be adding something here to help weigh down the beaker more, but it's not necessary if you aren't clumsy like me and spill stuff all the time.

Don't use the supplement crystals!! It's not worth the trouble!)\n\n0.3% liquid germall plus\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Combine ferulic acid & dimethyl isosorbide together in beaker #1 (bigger beaker). Stir with rod until dissolved. (It took me less than a minute or something.)\n2. Once dissolved, add distilled water & HA stock in into beaker #1. Mix.\n3. Weigh and **record** the weight.\n4. Combine OIL PHASE into beaker #2 (medium size beaker is fine).\n5. Pour some distilled water into smol 50ml beaker #3.\n6. Set up double boiler and heat til water is 70 °C.\n7. Stick all three in there and wait \\~20 min.\n8. After 20 min, take them out, wipe bottoms, weigh beaker #1 (biggest beaker).\n9. Add the difference from smol beaker #3 to beaker #1.\n10. Dump beaker #2 contents into beaker #1. (Or whichever beaker is bigger/you like more.)\n11. Stir that sucker with the mini mixer for 2 minutes (timer). If it gels, stir in bursts.\n12. Leave til room temp to touch.\n13. Add the 15% ascorbic acid powder. Mix gently with the rod til dissolved.\n14. Add liquid germall plus, stir.\n15. Test pH. Aim for pH 3. (I needed a LOT of triethanolamine to up the pH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes**\n\n\\- Lotion crafter's ferulic acid is darker and more vibrantly yellow compared to the Making Cosmetic's one. MC's also smells a little like vanilla to me. Not sure if this implies anything about quality.\n\n\\- I was ***shocked*** at how easy and fast the ferulic acid powder dissolved in the dimethyl isosorbide compared to propylene glycol. I had to stir an insane amount for a very long time to get it to dissolve in PG.\n\n\\- I tried dissolving 0.5% ferulic acid in 10% dimethyl isosorbide, but used Making Cosmetics ferulic acid powder instead of Lotioncrafter's. I had to stir like a madman again, and it wasn't dissolving as easily. It didn't take as long as doing it with PG though. Not sure if 10% lowers the solubility too much or because the MC's powder is harder to dissolve than LC's.\n\n\\- Do noooooooooot overmix. I didn't know what theacidqueen meant when it starts \"gelling\", I was like, huh, it still looks liquid, so I mixed and mixed because my supplement vitamin c crystals weren't dissolving (and it didn't dissolve overnight). Ended up with jelly chunks. Had to heat it. Stuck it back in the fridge and it got even chunkier after a few weeks. I literally had ZERO issues with gelling when I used the ultra fine vitamin C powder.\n\n\\- The vitamin C serum I made with supplement crystal oxidized much faster than I expected. I used to use Timeless's vitamin C serum, and it remained clear til I used the whole thing up unless it was summer (applied 2x a day, about a month & a half. Timeless takes \\~3 months to start oxidizing for me in the fridge. I went through many bottles over the years.) It gets to be over 100 degrees F here during the summer and even Timeless oxidized pretty fast when left out on counter.\n\n\\- Previously, I have used SAP and MAP serums before as well. I had nearly zero results from these. I think my skin just weirdly gives ingredients a hard time to penetrate it, because actives that work really well for other people don't seem to impact my skin a whole lot.\n\n\\- Results: I haven't used this long (only several days) so I can't say much. However, I did find that my skin (and my mom's) started glowing again, in the glass-skin way and not grease-all-over way. Results have been a little slower/slightly less impactful so far than Timeless's serum. I apply this twice a day because I had much better results applying twice a day than once with Timeless's serum too. Smaller pores in the morning, much better skin texture even after not getting much rest. Will update if results change.\n\n\\- This serum actually has some sort of a smell, unlike the previous one made with the food-grade vitamin C powder. It's,, hard to describe. It's not strong nor does it linger.\n\n\\- Make sure to adjust the pH right. The first serum I made, the pH was too low and it stung my skin and made my eyes hurt. But the new recipe does not.\n\n\\- Makes a serum very similar to the niacinamide serum. Every so slightly heavier feeling than NIANAG serum. Much more stickier drying down than NIANAG, takes much longer to dry down.\n\nI think, with the vitamin e oil I use, it's just the nature of the beast. It's EXTREMELY thick, heavy, and sticky. I can't get it off of anything it touches even with multiple washings with soap.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I didn't mean to make it sound like the vitamin c serum is unusable. I just meant compared to the nianag serum. It's not sticky once absorbed all the way. But I put lotions and stuff on top of it anyways, which takes care of any lingering stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VITAMIN C GEL-CREAM EXPERIMENT**\n\n\\- Test batched 0.5 oz because laureth-23 can be a trigger for acne for some people. I never had any trouble myself.\n\n\\- [Sepiplus 400](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/sepiplus-400?_pos=1&_sid=7c2c0b41a&_ss=r) is a cold process emulsifier (looks hella expensive, but you literally only need a few drops at a time), so I attempted to cold process a vitamin C + E + ferulic gel cream. No HA stock.\n\n\\- 0.5% of sepiplus 400 has no trouble emulsifying 5% mineral oil. However, this DID NOT work out with 1% vitamin e oil because of the extreme thickness. The emulsion broke.\n\n\\- Sepiplus 400 DOES work to emulsify everything together into a workable vitamin C gel creme. But you have probably have to use much more than 0.5%. At 2%, it makes a pretty thick gel, pale yellow color.\n\n\\- It was SUPER DUPER DUPER sticky. It took FOREVER to dry down and it left a weird white residue. Sepiplus 400 by itself is not sticky at all. Once absorbed, it literally feels like nothing. So I'm guessing it's the vitamin C + E that may be making it so sticky.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**IN CONCLUSION**\n\nI did SO much research over the years and slowly collected all the materials, and I finally made something I'm happy to use. 5%+ niacinamide and vitamin c + e + ferulic are skincare ingredients that I CANNOT live without. They have made my skin so much better, glow, and helped fix my decimated moisture barrier that I destroyed doing unsafe DIY when I was a complete noob. I'm happy to no longer have to pay $25 a bottle for vitamin C, and my niacinamide serum works just as well for me as Olay.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps someone!\n\nEdit 2: Woke up with amazingly glowy, beautiful skin this morning. I'm chuffed.\n\nEdit 3: Doi, I forgot the most important: [Batch size calculator](https://www.wholesalesuppliesplus.com/Calculators/Batch_Size_Calculator.aspx). You can calculate how much you want to make using the percentages!",

Both are cold process and anhydrous so you don't need double boiler or a preservative.  \n>  \n>They won't be as loaded with antioxidant power as C, E, Ferulic, but they are also very decent if your skin responds to vitamin c esters well. There's a rumor?? going around that tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is more powerful than ascorbic acid, but there is no evidence of that. The only way it \"works\" for our skin is for the esters to convert to ascorbic acid in the skin anyways, but since it's oil soluble, it's possible our skin will accept it better than other esters.",

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Round 12 - House of Mammoth Tobaccanist](http://imgur.com/a/wq8hxQO)\n\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI'm back for one final installment of The Tobacco Throwdown. On the chopping block this week is sub favorite House of Mammoth and their newest release *Tobaccanist*.\n\nHouse of Mammoth (originally Mammoth Soaps) was founded in 2018 by u/mammothben after several years of bath soap making and wetshaving merged into a new venture. Thirty some odd soap formulations later, and Mammoth Soaps was born.  Mammoth has since delighted the online shaving community with fantastic soap performace, original and evocative fragrancing, and continued charitable donations aimed to End Human Trafficking.\n\n**Packaging**\n\nMammoth uses dense clear and black plastic tubs, the kind formerly used by Barrister & Mann; these are my favorite tubs in the business. They are elegant and classy with the only down side being the lack of labelling on the side of the tub, which can make it tricky to find a particular soap in an overgrown shave den. Mammoth has switched to using balms in lieu of splashes as of late but all of their post shave products come in what are essentially standard glass bottles. The only real improvement to be made there might be including pumps with the balms. Mammoth uses a standardized label in varying shades for their different scents. It's a clean design but unique label art would be a nice addition down the road.\n\n**Scent** \n\n\n*Tobaccanist*  is a wood and (shockingly) tobacco centered fragrance that is described as a walk into a Tobaccanist's shop with rich notes of: *real tobacco absolute with cedarwood, dried fruit, amber, coumarin, spice, benzoin, heliotrope, and musk.*\n\n\nA playful and ethereal note of Heliotrops opens *Tobaccanist*, It is light enough to be both there and not  but is quickly reinforced by rich, sweet notes of dried fruit and the tiniest touch of spice. This light bouquet descends into a  warm heart of amber and cedarwood. A strong accord of coumarin, benzoin and Tobacco Absolut lay a dark and powerful foundation for *Tobaccanist.*  The rich and sultry authentic tobacco note is the bedrock here and is little short of stunning.  A sharp whiff of musk serves to texture and punctuate the fragrance as a whole. The shave balm maintains the same scent characteristics as the soap. *Tobaccanist's* Edp tells the same story as the soap and balm. Mammoth does a wonderful job of translating fragrances from pure scent into soaps and balms with a great deal of accuracy. Soaps can often color a fragrance but that has been accounted for in the Mammoth products I have used; scents maintain their true character but may lose a bit of definition. What the *Tobaccanist* Edp *does* do is present the same fragrance much more clearly. It is the equivalent difference of switching from standard to HDTV.  \n\n\n**Performance** \n\n\n*Tobaccanist* comes in Mammoth's Tusk soap base which has its ingredients listed as:*stearic acid, water, potassium hydroxide, duck fat, beef tallow, glycerin, babassu oil, sodium hydroxide, sodium lactate, fragrance, argan oil, murumuru butter, daikon seed extract, tocopherol, silk amino acids, lanolin, hydrolyzed oats, willow bark extract, allantoin*  \n\nThere are a few unusual ingredients in there like duck fat, argan oil, daikon seed, and silk aminos which seem to have been put to good use.\n\n Tusk is a very soft soap, probably up for croap status in my book. It is soft enough that sticking a glob of soap in my lather bowl can be a bit tricky (not that it's an actual problem). I assume brush loading is quick and easy. Tusk lathers up very quicky and easily into a super slick lather that cracks my top 3 with A&E Kaizen and Wholly Kaw Siero. Slickness, cushion, and post shave feel are all elite. Performance is very similar to Siero with a bit creamier lather that is slightly less slick but more cushiony. \n\nMammoth's Magic Post Shave balm is great as well. My *Tobaccanist* balm is a little lighter and looser than my *Hygge* and *Almond* *Leather* balms and I like the change, the loser formulation does demand a pump. Oh, I spilled quite a bit on my first attempts to use it, so do be aware of that! \nThe balm is light and refreshing and does not color fragrances, I don't know what more one could ask.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\n\nHouse of Mammoth's *Tobaccanist* was but a twinkle in u/mammothben's eye when this review series began its life. It is a coy Ourosboros of a scent. Sometimes I sniff the whole accord at once,  like a great  postmodern reimagining of the pipe tobacco I remember my grandfather smoking when I was young. Other times I only get the light essence of heliotrops that slowly draws me in to the greater story of this scent.  I love everything about it. It may come as little surprise then that *Tobaccanist* will be claiming the title of #Tobacco #Throwdown #Champion!\n\n\nAfter 12(ish) hard fought weeks, these soaps have given their best. Although not all can stand atop the podium any of these soaps would be a fine addition to a shave den. (except maybeTabac!)\n\n**Final Results**\n\nThe final standings for the 2021 Inaugural and probably only Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n* [#1.

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 22nd installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Stirling Soap Co. Stirling Spice](https://i.imgur.com/XOR1jsB.jpg)\n\nWell, it's been a long time coming. Stirling Spice probably should have been one of my first reviews given how often it was recommended as a dupe around here and the ubiquity of Stirling soaps in general in the wet shaving world. But, alas, the universe had other plans. When I first started this review series, Stirling Spice was becoming increasingly difficult to find, which made little sense as it was a popular scent. Turns out the scent(s) that Rod, the fine owner of Stirling, used was getting pretty expensive so he went on a hunt to replace it. So I waited... and waited... and waited... and shaved with other things... and waited... and learned how to pilot a spaceship... and waited... and briefly ruled a small Pacific Island country.... and waited... and died and was reincarnated... and waited...\n\nOriginally, I thought I'd only review the new version of Stirling Spice as that seemed like the prudent and less expensive way to go, but nothing in wet shaving is prudent and less expensive once you really get into it so I then decided I'd get the old version and the new version and do comparison reviews. I was, actually, very excited for this. The very kind u/NorthSoundHamster hooked me up with a tub of what I thought would be the old version since it had disappeared now completely from stores. Then I just had to wait for the new version to come out. So I waited more... and waited... and discovered the lost city of Atlantis... and waited... and remade all nine Skywalker Saga films into one man plays... and waited... and retired to a monastery in the Himalayas where I mediated silently for 94 years... and waited....\n\nAnd then the day came! Stirling Spice was back. The website was updated and I could finally do what I thought would be an incredibly interesting back-to-back review of the same soapmaker doing two different Old Spice dupes. Except... well, it turns out he couldn't find a better Old Spice scent so he just went back to the original. So all that waiting (and 94 years of silent meditation) were for nothing! What the hell am I going to do with an entire lost city, huh? No one is coming to my 23-hour-long *The Skywalker Saga But Everyone is Cowzilla3* play. The point being of this extremely long and mostly needless introduction to this Stirling review is that I really could have reviewed this at any time but we're here now so let's get the party started.\n\nYa'll know Stirling, right? Prolific soapmaker, community member, tons of scents, great price, been around forever (in artisan soap years), refuses to rebrand his entire company because I want to spell it Sterling instead? Yea, you know them.\n\nOK, we'll skip over the normal soapmaker intro then and get right to the soap itself. This is a straight duper with the only description being \"Our best attempt at recreating the classic Old Spice scent.\" No notes as to what that comprised of is but for most folks, I'll admit, the breakdown of scent in Old Spice means nothing and the scent itself as a whole is the scent in and of itself. No one besides crazy people who buy every tub of Old Spice dupe out there is going, \"Ahhh yes, I really pick up the citrus and musk here.\" They're just saying, \"That shit smells like my grandpa.\" So straight dupe, pure and simple.\n\nThe soap is a relatively harder soap, which may be one of the plethora of reasons I can think of that everyone says these pucks last for-damn-ever. It's got a slight tan to it with a bit of a swirl of darker and lighter aspects going through it. It's a pretty simple ingredient base that brings the Tallow and tosses in a few other ingredients that usually lead to quality shaves like coconut milk and shea butter. The full list of ingredients are Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate.\n\nStirling keeps the packaging simple with their containers, with each one looking the same except for the name of the soap and a color change around the border. There's not exciting tub art or specific logo for this, but that makes it feel kind classic, plus not having to do a different design for each soap must save some money. It's a good, solid, simple look.\n\n**Oldness: 5**\n\nWell, I can see why it was a struggle finding a dupe that worked as well as this and why everyone and their mother pointed me towards Stirling Spice as a solid dupe. Right of the puck this smacks you hard with straight-up vintage Old Spice scent that would remind anyone of whatever elder person they knew that wore it. The scent is really strong and really... old. I don't think I've sniffed a dupe that more epitomizes the cliche refrain that Old Spice often gets: \"You smell like my grandpa.\" (To which the only correct reply is, \"Thanks. Your Grandpa must have smelled really good.\")\n\n**Spiciness: 3**\n\nThis might be the hardest-to-explain spiciness score I've done considering the scent is very on the nose but... Stirling Spice is just too old for me. If we could theoretically divide Old Spice's scent up into old and spice, this one would lean more into the old. People often think of Old Spice as smelling too old, but I think there's more layers t it than that, but Stirling Spice seems to feel old in the way it presents. Maybe it's that the citrus isn't quite there on the nose or that its scent is so consistent throughout the shave without any change but, for me, the smell falls too far over into the realm of old man -- leans too much into nostalgia. And, yes, I realize that this entire series is basically about nostalgia but... go away, it's my review and this is the most idiotically subjective part.\n\n**Lather: 5**\n\nI revoke almost every other five lather I've given. I don't think I've used a soap that lathers this easily no matter what the hell you do to it. And not just an OK lather, a big, thick, sheeny, wonderful lather every time. I'm pretty sure you could accidentally drop a sliver of soap into your sink and have it touch a drop of water and you'd have a worthy shaving lather without even touching it. Yet another reason a tub lasts forever as you just don't need to use much soap to get a really good lather.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nI used the words solid, good, and simple in my intro a bunch and I think that's exactly what Stirling Spice delivers in its shave. This is a workman's soap that delivers a shave that you can be happy with but doesn't excel. I found the slickness to be good but not great, a nice cushion to develop but never get full, and a residual slickness that stayed around half the time. My only caveat here might be that because you need to use so little soap to get a lather then maybe I could have found a slicker shave with even less soap and more water.\n\n**Post: 4**\n\nIf I'm being honest this is probably a 3 as Stirling once again proves it to be a thoroughly solid soap in post as well. My face felt good, but never super moisturized and the scent stuck around for a bit but never that long -- a surprise given how strong it is on both the puck and in the lather. But it gets an entire extra point for how well it compliments my vintage Old Spice. Stirling Spice doesn't get lost in it like a lot of the other soaps do, it actively engages with it, proving even more that its most prominent aspect is \"old.\" It was such a stellar scent when put together that I did two vintage shaves this time around when I usually only do one.\n\n**Overall: 20**\n\nStirling Spice is like the workman of Old Spice dupes (now the picture makes sense!). It gets out there, does its job efficiently with the right tools, and heads back home with little pomp and circumstance. Incredibly easy to lather, it's just here to get the job done and done right (at a price point to match). That seems appropriate for a dupe I can best describe as old-school. For me, it just leans too far into that old aspect, delivering a scent that's more grandpa than vintage.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

I’ve enjoyed reading most of not every review of yours of all the old spice dupes out there.\n\nBeing a man in my thirties, my dad was on the cutting edge (pun intended) of shaving in the nineties, and exclusively used a Mach 3 with Barbasol cream in a can. BUUUT! He used old spice aftershave splash exclusively. So I did smell old spice, just not from the soap.\n\nTo this day, if I think of my dad, I think of this scent, but I also know that he eventually started buying the non Shulton aftershave, so it is all pretty muddied in my head movies.\n\nSo although I do wet shave, I don’t plan on chasing the scent like so many others. I love it, but it’s definitely not mine, and I am fine with keeping it that way. \n\nHowever, reading each of your reviews gets me closer and closer to going on and buying one.

    "body": "Hey everyone!\n\nSo today we have officially released our V3 base after six months of tinkering and testing. Now, I know what you are thinking, “Everyone is coming out with a new base! Grrrr”. This is true, but I dont consider our V3 base to be “New”. To me it is an evolution rather than a revolution. I hate the idea of changing bases. Our goal is to deliver a product that is familiar and high quality. If we are constantly changing our base completely then we run the risk of alienating our customer base and we have no desire to do that. So, with that said; this base is going to be very familiar to our V2 base. If you enjoyed that base then you will very likely enjoy V3.\n\nSo what is different in the version? First, some of the ratios changed a little bit. We wanted to have a cleaner soap in the tub and this helped a lot with achieving that. Next, we removed Tucuma butter and replaced it with Mango seed butter. This was mainly a business decision as Tucuma was becoming harder to source in large quantities. We also added Allantoin and Sodium Lactate. These do great things for your skin and help make our soap a bit more fluid during the cooking phase. And finally, we have Tetrasodium EDTA. This was added to help those with harder water get a better lather. It binds to the metal ions in the water and inactivates them.\n\nSome other updates…\n\n**Northern Elixir -**\n\nOur next release (May 21st) is going to be Northern Elixir! When we first launched we offered this and now we decided to bring it back with an update on the fragrance. We wanted to offer a mentholated soap that was a cheaper alternative then something like Orbit. You can find more details on our upcoming page.\n\n**Orbit -**\n\nOrbit will return at some point this summer. We had a large amount of fragrance compounded for us but UPS delivered an empty box to us. So somewhere at UPS is many kilos of Orbit fragrance sitting around. We have more in the process of being made, so it is coming… eventually.\n\n**Gift Cards -**\n\nWe now offer gift cards for purchase. These never expire.\n\n**Vendor Restocks -**\n\nMany of your favorite vendors have restock orders in with us. We are in the process of packing those orders and will be shipping to them this week.\n\n**International Shipping -**\n\nWe are going to go ahead and open up international shipping for you guys. Shipping cost will likely be pretty high but it's an option if you choose it. We will not be able to ship our aftershaves internationally. If you try, you will get an error at checkout.\n\nThank you everyone for your support!\nwww.nobleotter.com \n\nCody",

    "body": "[I purchased this item myself.](https://i.imgur.com/ZKt37cP.jpg) \n\n\n# Impressions, Fragrance, Packaging\n\nI'm only going to quickly hit some of these points. I'm going to primarily focus my review around the ingredients and my thoughts on the new formulation. I'm sure many others will focus on the rest.\n\nGeneral impressions of the product are great and typical of what we've come to expect from Barrister and Mann. I always enjoy the little goodies and extras thrown in (this time some fitting espresso hard candies). I see BaM is now using the Parkway 100mm low profile jars that have become ubiquitous in artisan shaving soap. I haven't purchased a new soap for perhaps a year — is this a new change or has this been the case for a while?\n\nI personally love the fragrance of Leviathan, though I can understand it can be polarizing. \"It smells like you just smoked a cigar and tried to cover it up with a fragrance\" — my loving wife. That deep, black coffee and leather combination is intoxicating. Soap is frankly a terrible way to experience fragrance, but [I have a bottle of Leviathan aftershave from perhaps 2016 or 2017](https://i.imgur.com/B2z2qwM.jpg) that allows me to pick up the nuance. There's more sweetness and spice in the liquid form. Again, many other Leviathan reviews around talking about the fragrance. I will yield to those.\n\n\n# Performance\n\nWhat can I say? It's superb. A modern classic and a worthy sibling to BaM's other creations. I was hoping it could hold a candle to Reserve - one of my other favorites - and it does; improves even, on some of Reserve's best qualities.\n\nThe lather is so dense [it becomes almost waxy](https://i.imgur.com/SYRsScz.jpg) (I mean that in a good way). It's so water tolerant that it's almost water resistant (again, a little tongue-in-cheek, but I mean it in a good way). Water really needs to be worked into the lather to get the benefit of the performance. It doesn't behave like a \"foamy\" soap. If foamy soaps pull bubbles out of air, this soap instead pulls texture from water. It's thick and smooth. Not foamy and pillowy. \n\nThe slickness and skin feel when shaving is also best-in-class comfortable. \n\nPost shave feeling rivals Reserve. \n\nI would expect a lot of high praise for Omnibus coming soon. \n\n# Ingredients\n\nOk, for the main event.\n\n*Water, Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Sodium Stearate, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Juice, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Tetrasodium Ethylendiamine Disuccinate, Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma Grandiflorum Butter, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Potassium Cocoate, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Goat Milk Powder, Persea Grattisima Oil, Sodium Cocoate, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Rubra Extract*\n\nI'll give my best insight on the ingredient list. But I'm not an expert and I can only base my insights on my own experience, which is imperfect in itself. You can only glean so much from an ingredient list before it takes the person formulating it to explain the why's and how's. The \"secret sauce\", as it were, is the combination of the ingredients, the relative amounts of each, why each individual component was chosen over an alternative, how they interact and counteract, and the process by which it all comes together. That's not something that we're going to know and that's not something we should expect or ask any soapmaker - or businessperson at large - to divulge. Basically I'm saying that my ability to interpret this stuff is flawed by the very nature of even doing this. I think it's important to have that humility before any of us try to analyze ingredients - myself included.\n\n**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil**. These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified. There is nothing particularly questionable or curious here and I would say we often see high performing soaps with a version of these \"base\" ingredients. \n\n**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide**. I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\". Both sodium and potassium hydroxide are used as the caustic reagents. Again, nothing particularly unique about that in shaving soap. Both are generally solubilized into water. I'm going to guess that coconut milk and the goat milk powder are added to this solution as well, but it's just a guess. Those things could be added somewhere else. Milks are often substituted for water or in addition to water in an effort to make a lather less pillowy and more creamy. I've never seen any science on that, but that's generally the narrative espoused in the soapmaking community so I'll mention it. Like most things in soapmaking, once you nail down a core formula of ingredients, the other onesy-twosy additives tend to be incremental rather than fundamental, at least in my experience. Enough of those ingredients cleverly combined I think can make for a distinguishable performance difference cumulatively, but it's tough for me to tie one unit of a given ingredient to one unit of performance. So I won't attempt to do that with the milks used here.\n\n**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil**. This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant. Many ingredients going into the soapmaking process vs coming out of the soapmaking process are compositionally different. Any oils, butters, or triglyceride-containing stuff still in their \"original\" form on this ingredient list means it must be the superfat. I'm of the opinion that the amount and the constituent components of the superfat have a good hand in how the lather behaves and feels. Others might disagree with that, but I'm going to say this unique combination of oils in the superfat probably have a meaningful role in determining how dense, protective, and stable the lather feels on the face. The importance of the superfat I think is particularly unique in shaving soap. \"Stability\" and \"denseness\" of a lather don't really matter in other forms of soap. Body soap, hand soap, even shampoo; most all other surfactant applications are rinse-off almost as quickly as applied. A shaving soap provides critical buffer between an in-motion blade and the skin for minutes at a time, so that kind of thing matters.\n\n**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate**. We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\". Hydroxyethylcellulose I know to be a thickening ingredient. In fact, when you see any \"cellulose\" on a label, that's generally what those ingredients are for. I've used it a couple times when messing around with making shampoo, but I didn't go much further. I found it to be incredibly finicky. It was stubborn to melt and quickly became tough to work with when cooled. I really don't know what it's used for here. If you've ever made a high stearic soap, you know that it has a tendency to seize up. I wouldn't think you would want to thicken a soap like this - it's the first time I've seen this ingredient in a shaving soap - but I don't know what it behaves like when it's cooking and I don't know the process steps involved to make it. It does make sodium lactate even more curious because I've always used sodium lactate in shaving soap as an ingredient to metaphorically \"even out the high spots\". Things just mix a little easier with it and it cures the soap a little more consistently. Part vanity, part functional. It's also a humectant, so there's a theoretical skin benefit there, too. \n\n**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate**. Let's go with so-called \"skin food\". This far down the ingredient list, I can only more or less guess at some of these. I'm sure Will would raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but here goes. The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property. They are very concentrated, and for that reason, you will most always see them at or near the bottom of an ingredient list used in tiny quantities. I haven't used these particular extracts, but I have used others. Xanthan gum could have a few uses. It's in many cosmetics as a thickener and stabilizer, but I included it in this category because I've heard Will talk about it in the context of skin feel. I think I remember he pointed to xanthan gum as a potential cause of poor after-shave feel for those who under-hydrated the previous Excelsior formula. The xanthan gum effectively \"used up all the water\". So maybe the intent with xanthan gum in this formula is to alter the stability of the lather's water-tolerance? Especially seeing how this soap behaves with water; that'd be my guess - used as an ingredient to keep water in the soap and keep the lather from \"breaking\", but who knows. It interacts with water in a big way, though, so I know it must have something to do with that property. Sacharride isometerate is a moisturizer / emollient.\n\nHere's the \"other\" category: **Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin**. Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\n**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here. Because of where it appears on the ingredient list, it's not used in negligible amounts, so I have to believe it has some kind of meaningful functional purpose - like a detergent or foaming property or something - but I've never used it or heard of this particular flavor of sulfonic acid. Reading about it doesn't give me any better or more insightful shot at it so I'm just going to leave it at *shrug.*\n\n# My Thoughts\n\nWill has always done a great job pushing the envelope of ingredients in his soaps. In my opinion, he innovates more than probably anyone else in the artisan sphere and doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been. \n\nI'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better. But I am saying that there is a vocal group of people with opinions about cosmetics that appear to confuse synthetic for \"dangerous\", and minimal for optimal. And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nThat is my primary purpose for writing a review up this way. Just wanted to share my perspective on this latest creation and explain how pleased I am to see continual innovation in artisan formulation. I'm probably a little off in my analysis, it's tough to make these kinds of assumptions and generalizations. But that's not really the point. I wanted to make a write-up to bring some attention to this kind of pursuit. \n\nIt takes a ton of work to reformulate a product. I will often see people talk about a new soap fragrance in the same vein as a new soap base. This is understandable. From the perspective of a customer, it's a very similar buying experience and feeling of anticipation. And I'm sure artisans spend enormous amounts of time tinkering with a fragrance. But innovating on a soap formula is a little bit of a different skill and it's a much bigger commitment from the standpoint of the business. There are re-packaging considerations, stability considerations, and most of all, there's a lot of trial and error. In short, it is a risk. Even more so when you're working with ingredients that aren't traditionally used or often used at all in soap.\n\nSo hats off for Omnibus. I'm happy to say it joins the ranks among Reserve and Milksteak as my favorite all-around performers.\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "Okay, full rundown:\n\n>**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil.** These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak.

On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate.** We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\".\n\nLess correct, but you're absolutely right that HEC is a pain to work with; it's going to take me until the third production batch to get some of the stuff to stop seizing into little bits. These two materials are not really related to each other in any functional sense, though; the HEC serves as a lubricant and to help tame the drying effects of xanthan gum, while the sodium lactate is used to make the soap both more pliable when it's hot and harder when it's cool. \n\n>**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate.** Let's go with so-called \"skin food\"...The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property.\n\nAgain, partly correct. Marshmallow and slippery elm are both skin soothers and moisturizers (their internal \"mucilage\" helps keep your skin feeling nice, and they contain various other classes of molecules that serve as anti-irritants. I actually experimented with using a few other botanicals as well, most notably licorice, but found that most of them provide limited benefit and impart weird colors and/or aromas to the base, which, if I'm being honest, smells faintly of graham crackers off the puck.\n\nXanthan gum serves the same function that it did in Excelsior and Soft Heart, which is as a lubricant. However, as noted, it has a tendency to try people's skin unless you dump HUGE amounts of water into it, so I opted to remedy this effect by replacing some of it with hydroxyethylcellulose, which is much easier on the skin, but not perfect on its own.\n\nSaccharide Isomerate is a contact moisturizer that can tolerate alkaline environments, and the level at which we use it can actually increase moisture retention in skin to which it's applied by as much as 10%.\n\n>**Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin.** Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\nCorrect about the TED: it's biodegradable, unlike tetrasodium EDTA, and doesn't present the same \"OMG IT'S POISON\" vibe that the green community has applied to EDTA. Both are harmless, for those curious.\n\nAs for glycerin, we use additional glycerin in the soapmaking process, which is why it appears on the ingredient list so prominently.\n\n>**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here.\n\nAh, the magic material. Also known by its equally inscrutable trade name Rheocare HSP-1180, this is a synthetic anionic polymer produced from renewable feedstocks. It improves lubrication dramatically and imparts a luxurious, talc-like post-shave without sealing the skin or exhibiting comedogenic behavior, meaning that it cannot clog pores or cause breakouts. It's fascinating stuff, and one of the most exciting things that I have ever come across in cosmetic chemistry.\n\n>doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit.

And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nI too really appreciate your saying this. I believe strongly that much of the improvements that we have seen in the past decade of shaving soap development are due to radical technological advancements over the last 70 years, and it seems absurd to me to exclude things like renewable polymers and chelating agents from that conversation simply because they have scary sounding names. My explanation to folks regarding natural materials is generally along the following lines: Arsenic, cyanide, and lily of the valley are all completely natural. All three will kill you. Painfully. Natural does not mean safe or better, and synthetic does not mean dangerous or bad. They're all just tools.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll in all, you did really well! It's important that people understand what is being used in the products that go on their faces, and, while there's a \"secret sauce\" aspect to this, but I've said nothing here that someone couldn't learn with Google, and the real secrets are in the proportions and methodologies, not the list itself. I have nothing to hide, and everything that we use is quite safe according to every authority that I can find (that isn't, you know, some dimwit screaming about how \"chemicals\" are bad).\n\nEither way, I appreciate your taking the time to break it down for folks; I mean to put up a blog post on the subject by the end of the week, but we'll see if that actually comes to fruition. :D",

I used this in the AM. Doesn’t react with tret creams. Loved using this although fragrance can be a downside.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow S Foaming Facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*currently using in the AM*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid\n\nBrief review: Bought this because i was tired of purchasing 50ml small bottles of foaming facewash since this was available in a 100ml pack. The ingredients are ok. Not as good as oraface. The pump is wasteful and more product is wasted than used. Didn’t cause breakouts. Decent face wash.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetaphil oily skin facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 years + {*currently using in the PM*}\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product. Holygrail face wash, can always rely on this face wash. I first started using this when I first started breaking out and this delivered well. I still use it in the PM only to avoid actives overload.\n\n>WRP. Holy grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Toners*\n\n**Simple kind to skin toner** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 months {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, witch hazel\n\nBrief review: Decent, beginner friendly toner. I loved using it and so did my friends after purchasing it on my recommendation. The witch hazel was the right amount so it did not strip off my skin. It also had some moisturising ingredients because my face did feel supple after use. Although since the production has begun in India and someone said the quality of the moisturiser has deteriorated so did not repurchase.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist PHA Toner** {*bought on a friends recommendation*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Inulin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Glycerin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate. \n\nBrief review: I did not like this toner and I was very hopeful for this toner because it had good reviews, great ingredients and budget price point.. For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H. Cordata Extract** {*self bought - youtuber influenced purchase*}\n\nUsage: 9 weeks {*currently using in the AM/PM*}\n\nIngredients:  Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexaniediol\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product for its affect on my skin as well as how multifunctional it is. It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly. Although I have been using it for the last 9 weeks and have only finished a little more than half the bottle. Although, once I finish this I might try a different one from the ONE THING range.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Serums*\n\n{*Since I was seeing a dermatologist for my acne and acne scars I used a couple of actives that were doctor recommended and since all of those were rx products I would not be reviewing those*}\n\n**Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin + 1% HA** {*bought on reddit recomendation*}\n\nUsage: 7 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin \n\nBrief review: Love it. Since I stopped using all rx products I wanted a serum for my PIH and PIE and reddit had some really good recommendation for this active. So I gave in and bought this and I lve lve love it, in 7 weeks i can see my old pih scars faded and any new red acne I have has a fast healing time after using AA. So definitely have a raving review for this product. I use 2 drops on moist skin (from toner) and it evenly layers out.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Suganda 5% Niacinamide** {*bought after i received a sample*}\n\nUsage: 8 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Niacinamide (5%), Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin \n\nBrief review: Again, very glad that my skin loved this product. It helps boost the effect f my minimalist AA serum. Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised. So if you hate fragrance, steer clear of this product.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed Clear Gel** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 3 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Panthenol\n\nBrief review: Loved the moisturiser especially in Delhi summers. Helped skin feel supple and moisturiser, can call this a substitute for HA serum.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Sepicalm Oat Moisturiser** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate \n\nBrief review: My skin hated this, it cause cc all over my skin and was very thick in consistency. I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP. Holy Fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 10 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: I love this, my skin loves this and I really hate that I love it because it is a very problematic brand. But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money. I also love how it is in an aluminium tube instead of a plastic one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Sunscreen*\n\n**UV Doux Sunscreen gel**\n\nUsage: currently in use {*only use when I step outside*}\n\nBrief review: I love this, bought this on recommendations from this channel and the texture is oh so lovely. The only con is the smell as it smells like baby powder x old deo lol but still a good purchase.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Sheet Mask - The Face Shop**\n\nReally loving these face masks these days incase anyone wanted a review, hehe.",

I got it for free from Myntra App along with their Vitamin C Serum.\n\n**Ingredients:** Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Isododecane, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Squalane, Solanum Lycopersicum (Tomato) Fruit Extract, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Microcrystalline Wax, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Quaternium-90 Sepiolite, Quaternium-90 Montmorillonite, BHT\n\n**Packaging:** Tube \n\n**Texture:** White P\nOpaque Gel\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\n**My Experience:** I didn't use this regularly, it was mostly kept in my office bag for applying during evenings while leaving work. \n\nAs the name suggests, there was never an issue of white cast due to its texture and colour. With invisible sunscreen, you gotta know till when you to massage the sunscreen. I feel with other sunscreens, you've an idea on how long to blend or massage. With invisible sunscreen, if not applied properly, it starts pilling off.\n\nThe texture was matte, so probably it felt on my face for a while post application. My biggest issue with this was that it irritated my eyes if I accidentally brushed over anywhere near my eye area (I didn't directly touch my eyes). And seeing as it happened multiple times, I think i was turned off this product, wanting to never purchase it.\n\nWhich won't be an issue coz I don't see this product anywhere. It's probably discontinued.\n\n**(2)Cosiq Airgel Nmf-15% Moisturiser For Oily Skin**\n\n**Price:** Rs. 599/- for 100 ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract, Bacillus/Carrot Root Ferment Filtrate, Glycerine, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Gluconate, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Betaine, Sodium Carbomer, Allantoin, Betaine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Pca, Serine, Alanine, Glycine, Glutamic Acid, Lysine Hcl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Water, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Vitamin E, Sodium Gluconate, Menthyl Lactate, Menthol\n\n**Packaging:** Airpump in a Tube\n\n**Texture:** Lightweight Airy gel.\n\n**My Experience:** I was influenced to buy this from this Oily Moisturizer guide of one of the IG influencers. \n\nPros - Very affordable and comes in good quantity. It's a steal for its price. Very lightweight, blends easily , gives a matte finish but doesn't feel that it's sitting on your skin (like many matte products). \n\nIf your skin type is combination leaning to dry side, this won't be sufficient for you. As it states, it's great for oily skin as it feels nothing when you apply, and works wonderfully for Summers. \n\nCons: Tbh, None. It's not as great as some other moisturizers that I've used, but for the price, it's a great product.\n\nI might repurchase it again unless I get some k-beauty products on good discount.\n\n**3)Vaseline Gluta Hya Antioxidant SPF 50 PA+++ Sunscreen**\n\n**Price:** 699/- for 175ml\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Disodium Phenyl Dibenzimidazole Tetrasulfonate, Triethanolamine, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Hydroxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cystine, Glycine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glutathione, Cyclopentasiloxane, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Perfume, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Cyclomethicone, Petrolatum, BHT, Tocopherol\n\n**Texture:** Serum like lotion\n\n**Fragrance:** Yes\n\n**My Experience:** It's a wonderful sunscreen at a very decent price. \n\nPros are that it's  very lightweight, has a serum like texture that blends in seconds. It's claim of serum bursting into water and absorbing quickly, is true. It always gives a very dewy and shiny finish.\n\nCons - Very sticky, though it does feels normal after a few minutes. \nIt doesn't prevent tanning. My hands are quite tanned, and since its texture is like a serum, I did use quite a lot of product while applying it on my hands. There was no pilling, but no saving from tan.\n\nI would repurchase it for other seasons like winters or monsoons. For now, I've purchased Nivea sunscreen again, my HG for body sunscreen.\n\nDo share your experiences if you've tried these or similar products.\n\n",

    "body": "Hi guys. :) I just thought I should share how I've been making my serums. I modified u/theacidqueen's [DIY Skinceuticals Vitamin C Dupe](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/01/12/fun-with-diy-skinceuticals-dupe-vitamin-c-tutorial/) recipe for the vitamin C. She is brilliant.\n\nI usually make my serums at the same time. I will link where I got the ingredients and equipment, but you can get them from any source of your choice.\n\nThe reason I switched out the solvents is because when I made the serums with ethoxydiglycol and propylene glycol, I found them incredibly sticky (my eyelids were sticking together), a little greasy, and heavy-feeling. Ethoxydiglycol really helped to make the serum feel lighter to Ally (sorry if I misspelled) but to me, it made it feel much heavier/stickier. I guess that just goes to show you how subjective skin-feel and such are (could've been other factors too)!\n\nI wanted to share how these recipes worked out **for me** and talk about how effective they have been so far. I always see recipes and doing things right on DIY sources, but not how effective they are in practice. So I thought I would add that as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**=** [**PICTURES ON IMGUR.**](https://imgur.com/a/7zKLhoF) **=**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Materials Used (for both serums):**\n\n\\- 2\\~3 [weigh boats](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/weight-boats?_pos=9&_sid=a801f914b&_ss=r) *(to weigh powders)*\n\n\\- 3 [small scoops](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/Dispensing-Spoon_p_342.html)/any plastic spoons *(The ones I got from MC were too dang small, but great for very small test batches.)*\n\n\\- [Scale weighing to 0.01g](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E6RE3A0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) *(I've had this for years and I love it.

Combine WATER PHASE into the bigger beaker.\n2. Weigh it, record the weight (the entire beaker + contents) on a piece of paper/flashcard.\n3. Put the silicone trivet into the flat pot and fill it up water. Then heat it to 70 °C.\n4. Take the smol 50ml beaker and fill it with some distilled water.\n5. Put them on top of the trivet and heat for \\~20 min. (Heat should be between 70-75 °C)\n6. Meanwhile, you can mix COOL DOWN PHASE in a different beaker.\n7. Take them out, weigh the bigger beaker. Subtract the new weight from the beginning weight.\n8. Take that much out of the smol 50ml beaker, add it to bigger beaker.\n9. Leave it til it reaches 50 °C.\n10. Pour the COOL DOWN PHASE mix into the bigger beaker and mix with mini mixer (or by hand).\n11. Test the pH, adjust to pH 6. (I used [citric acid](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/citric-acid?_pos=1&_sid=c2f3237c7&_ss=r) mixed with distilled water to lower, and triethanolamine to raise. I got triethanolamine at Lotioncrafter's but they no longer carry it. I read that you can use baking soda instead, or sodium hydroxide/lye. You can use sodium lactate too, but you would need asssssloads of it as it's a weak base.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes**\n\n\\- Makes a lightweight, very watery but slightly viscous, colorless serum. A bit tacky while drying down, but once absorbed fully, not tacky at all.\n\n\\- You can cold process this, but I've had better results hot processing it for whatever reason.\n\n\\- I definitely noticed a difference in how my skin looks using dimethyl isosorbide VS ethoxydiglycol + propylene glycol or propylene glycol alone, in all my other past iterations of this serum (it was a gel-cream at first). My skin looked brighter and a little smoother faster compared to the past recipes.\n\nThe reason you don't see this ingredient more in both DIY and in commercial products is because it's really expensive compared to glycols/alcohol. :\\[ I have only seen them in The Ordinary & Drunk Elephant, but some other high-end brands use it too apparently, according to INCIDecoder.\n\nI was frustrated that I wasn't getting the same results as commercial niacinamide serums with my cold processed gel-cream. But I'm finally seeing results. I find niacinamide *incredibly* helpful for keeping my super dry skin/skin barrier healthy. I love it most of all for how it smooths out my skin texture like I'm wearing a primer. It helps slowly fade PIH as well, but don't expect any miracles.\n\n\\- Don't be alarmed when the white powder doesn't dissolve and is chunky when you're making your HA stock. Just shake it a little and leave it overnight. It'll be clear and non-chunky in the morning! :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VITAMIN C SERUM**\n\n(The directions are pretty much from the original post.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*WATER PHASE*\n\n0.5% [ferulic acid](https://lotioncrafter.com/search?type=product&q=ferulic*)\n\n15% dimethyl isosorbide\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n15% hyaluronic stock\n\n50.2% distilled water\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*OIL PHASE*\n\n1% [tocopherol](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/vitamin-e-mixed-tocopherols-95?_pos=2&_sid=94731dbdb&_ss=r)\n\n3% [laureth-23](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/laureth-23?_pos=1&_sid=697dc4bd7&_ss=r)\n\n*(Next time, will be adding something here to help weigh down the beaker more, but it's not necessary if you aren't clumsy like me and spill stuff all the time. Just make sure the beaker doesn't fall over in the double boiler.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*COOL DOWN PHASE*\n\n15% [l-ascorbic acid](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/Vitamin-C-L-ascorbic-acid-USP_p_321.html) (ultra fine. Don't use the supplement crystals!! It's not worth the trouble!)\n\n0.3% liquid germall plus\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Combine ferulic acid & dimethyl isosorbide together in beaker #1 (bigger beaker). Stir with rod until dissolved. (It took me less than a minute or something.)\n2. Once dissolved, add distilled water & HA stock in into beaker #1. Mix.\n3. Weigh and **record** the weight.\n4. Combine OIL PHASE into beaker #2 (medium size beaker is fine).\n5. Pour some distilled water into smol 50ml beaker #3.\n6. Set up double boiler and heat til water is 70 °C.\n7. Stick all three in there and wait \\~20 min.\n8. After 20 min, take them out, wipe bottoms, weigh beaker #1 (biggest beaker).\n9. Add the difference from smol beaker #3 to beaker #1.\n10. Dump beaker #2 contents into beaker #1. (Or whichever beaker is bigger/you like more.)\n11. Stir that sucker with the mini mixer for 2 minutes (timer). If it gels, stir in bursts.\n12. Leave til room temp to touch.\n13. Add the 15% ascorbic acid powder. Mix gently with the rod til dissolved.\n14. Add liquid germall plus, stir.\n15. Test pH. Aim for pH 3. (I needed a LOT of triethanolamine to up the pH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes**\n\n\\- Lotion crafter's ferulic acid is darker and more vibrantly yellow compared to the Making Cosmetic's one. MC's also smells a little like vanilla to me. Not sure if this implies anything about quality.\n\n\\- I was ***shocked*** at how easy and fast the ferulic acid powder dissolved in the dimethyl isosorbide compared to propylene glycol. I had to stir an insane amount for a very long time to get it to dissolve in PG.\n\n\\- I tried dissolving 0.5% ferulic acid in 10% dimethyl isosorbide, but used Making Cosmetics ferulic acid powder instead of Lotioncrafter's. I had to stir like a madman again, and it wasn't dissolving as easily. It didn't take as long as doing it with PG though. Not sure if 10% lowers the solubility too much or because the MC's powder is harder to dissolve than LC's.\n\n\\- Do noooooooooot overmix. I didn't know what theacidqueen meant when it starts \"gelling\", I was like, huh, it still looks liquid, so I mixed and mixed because my supplement vitamin c crystals weren't dissolving (and it didn't dissolve overnight). Ended up with jelly chunks. Had to heat it. Stuck it back in the fridge and it got even chunkier after a few weeks. I literally had ZERO issues with gelling when I used the ultra fine vitamin C powder.\n\n\\- The vitamin C serum I made with supplement crystal oxidized much faster than I expected. I used to use Timeless's vitamin C serum, and it remained clear til I used the whole thing up unless it was summer (applied 2x a day, about a month & a half. Timeless takes \\~3 months to start oxidizing for me in the fridge. I went through many bottles over the years.) It gets to be over 100 degrees F here during the summer and even Timeless oxidized pretty fast when left out on counter.\n\n\\- Previously, I have used SAP and MAP serums before as well. I had nearly zero results from these. I think my skin just weirdly gives ingredients a hard time to penetrate it, because actives that work really well for other people don't seem to impact my skin a whole lot.\n\n\\- Results: I haven't used this long (only several days) so I can't say much. However, I did find that my skin (and my mom's) started glowing again, in the glass-skin way and not grease-all-over way. Results have been a little slower/slightly less impactful so far than Timeless's serum. I apply this twice a day because I had much better results applying twice a day than once with Timeless's serum too. Smaller pores in the morning, much better skin texture even after not getting much rest. Will update if results change.\n\n\\- This serum actually has some sort of a smell, unlike the previous one made with the food-grade vitamin C powder. It's,, hard to describe. It's not strong nor does it linger.\n\n\\- Make sure to adjust the pH right. The first serum I made, the pH was too low and it stung my skin and made my eyes hurt. But the new recipe does not.\n\n\\- Makes a serum very similar to the niacinamide serum. Every so slightly heavier feeling than NIANAG serum. Much more stickier drying down than NIANAG, takes much longer to dry down.\n\nI think, with the vitamin e oil I use, it's just the nature of the beast. It's EXTREMELY thick, heavy, and sticky. I can't get it off of anything it touches even with multiple washings with soap.\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I didn't mean to make it sound like the vitamin c serum is unusable. I just meant compared to the nianag serum. It's not sticky once absorbed all the way. But I put lotions and stuff on top of it anyways, which takes care of any lingering stickiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VITAMIN C GEL-CREAM EXPERIMENT**\n\n\\- Test batched 0.5 oz because laureth-23 can be a trigger for acne for some people. I never had any trouble myself.\n\n\\- [Sepiplus 400](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/sepiplus-400?_pos=1&_sid=7c2c0b41a&_ss=r) is a cold process emulsifier (looks hella expensive, but you literally only need a few drops at a time), so I attempted to cold process a vitamin C + E + ferulic gel cream. No HA stock.\n\n\\- 0.5% of sepiplus 400 has no trouble emulsifying 5% mineral oil. However, this DID NOT work out with 1% vitamin e oil because of the extreme thickness. The emulsion broke.\n\n\\- Sepiplus 400 DOES work to emulsify everything together into a workable vitamin C gel creme. But you have probably have to use much more than 0.5%. At 2%, it makes a pretty thick gel, pale yellow color.\n\n\\- It was SUPER DUPER DUPER sticky. It took FOREVER to dry down and it left a weird white residue. Sepiplus 400 by itself is not sticky at all. Once absorbed, it literally feels like nothing. So I'm guessing it's the vitamin C + E that may be making it so sticky.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**IN CONCLUSION**\n\nI did SO much research over the years and slowly collected all the materials, and I finally made something I'm happy to use. 5%+ niacinamide and vitamin c + e + ferulic are skincare ingredients that I CANNOT live without. They have made my skin so much better, glow, and helped fix my decimated moisture barrier that I destroyed doing unsafe DIY when I was a complete noob. I'm happy to no longer have to pay $25 a bottle for vitamin C, and my niacinamide serum works just as well for me as Olay.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps someone!\n\nEdit 2: Woke up with amazingly glowy, beautiful skin this morning. I'm chuffed.\n\nEdit 3: Doi, I forgot the most important: [Batch size calculator](https://www.wholesalesuppliesplus.com/Calculators/Batch_Size_Calculator.aspx).

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "**Review (Long Term Usage; 1+ years)** I have been using a few CeraVe products for more than an year. Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

    "body": "[The Tobacco Throwdown Round 9 - Stirling Soaps Haverford](http://imgur.com/a/p2i9QUA)\n\n* **Brush:** Lancaster Brushworks\n\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n\n* **Blade:** GSB\n\n\n* **Lather:** Stirling Soaps Haverford\n\n\n* **Post:** Stirling Soaps Haverford Splash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStirling Soaps should be no secret amongst this community, but in the unlikely event you have taken residence under a rock for the last few years, here you go: Stirling Soaps was founded in 2012 by Rod and Mandy Lovan as a way to embrace a more relaxed soap making lifestyle and take advantage of a passion for wetshaving that Rod acquired while serving overseas.  Stirling has been known to offer one of the best price to performance ratios in the wetshaving world. After becoming a household name for wetshavers Stirling has expanded into other beauty products including shampoos and body butter, and has recently started roasting and selling coffees. Stirling is aiming to upgrade your entire morning routine!\n\n*Haverford* is named after  the debonaire Tom Haverford of Parks and Recreation fame and inspired by the equally suave Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford, one of my personal favorite scents. The scent notes on *Haverford* are listed as: *tobacco, woods, vanilla, tobacco leaf, tonka bean, fruit, and cocoa* \n\n*Haverford* is sweet and strong off the puck, lathering it up does give the scent a little more room to breathe, while not changing its essential character. \n\nA rich note of caramelized vanilla immediately wafts forward. This ultra sweet note is rounded out on the bottom by a hint of almondine tonka bean and accented by notes of dried fruit.  The vanilla transitions smoothly into a bold note of tobacco which takes center stage while being grounded in an earthy base of cocoa.  The spicier notes of the tobacco accord close the fragrance in an approachable manner, but do not tread into overly dry cured tobacco territory which can push some  fragrances into more controversial territory.  The matching aftershave splash follows the same basic blueprints but moves more quickly through the sweeter opening into a richer tobacco closing,  the spicier notes no longer blunted by the soaps base.\n\n There is nothing revolutionary in *Haverford*, but it is a very well executed take on the Tobacco and Vanilla tango.  *Haverford* strikes a fine repose between the incredible sweetness of HSSC's *Havana* *Vieja* and the thinner, dirtier take of A&E's *Vanille* *de* *Tabac*.\n\nStirling makes a few kinds of tallow base, and *Haverford*   is produced in their beef tallow base.  The ingredients are as follows: *Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, and Sodium Lactate*\n\n\n\nAs mentioned before, Stirling's beef tallow soap base provides a wonderful balance between high performance and low cost.  It is quick and easy to lather and provides great cushioning and slickness for 1/2 to 1/3 the price of some of the most upper echelon artisans. Stirling does not provide the exotic skin foods or post shave refreshment of some of those more luxurious brands. If you are having trouble getting a great shave with Stirling products, howver, odds are that the issue does not lie with the soap.\n\n*Haverford* is a great homage to a classic tobacco fragrance. It hits the middle nground between sweetness and spicy tobacco funk that should make it an attractive option for anyone wanting to explore the tobacco vanilla genre. I really enjoy this scent, and while it is not groundbreakingly innovative it certainly makes for a   great staple in any den. I do prefer A&E's *Vanille* *de* *Tabac* for the same basic scent profile but that is just a personal preference.\n\nAs of round 9 the standings for the Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n\n* [#1. Ariana & Evans Vanille de Tabac](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m6y9qa/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_5_ariana_evans/?)\n\n* [#2. Henri et Victoria Cognac and Cuban Cigars](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lvwwij/tobacco_throwdown_day_1_henri_et_victoria_cognac/)\n\n\n* [#3.

Stirling Soaps Haverford](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/mtas10/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_9_stirling_soaps/?)\n\n* [#5. Highland Springs Soap Company Havan Vieja](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lyb2k8/tobacco_throwdown_round_2_highland_springs_soap/)\n\n* [#6. Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m4tdmg/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_4_summer_break_soaps/?)\n\n* [#7. Pre  de Provence No. 63](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m1786o/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_3_pre_de_provence_no/)\n\n\n* [#8. Barrister and Mann The Full Measure of Man](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/mju9xy/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_7_barrister_mann_the/?)\n\n\n* [#9. Maurer & Wirtz Tabac Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/moox08/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_7_mauer_wirtz_tabac/?)\n\nI do want to say that as this challenge has progressed, I have used each set at least 3 times in an attempt to really get to know each individual fragrance. I keep a fresh bowl of lather on the desk next to me for reference as I write. I have continued to revisit past scents that I have already reviewed to help maintain perspective. I don't want to say that I have shortchanged anyone in my reviews (and I hope I am correct in that belief) but I do think that weighting the rankings so far toward my personal tastes may not have been the best way to approach this challenge. I love *Vanille* *de* *Tabac*, *Haverford*, and *Havana*  *Vieja*  but by and large, they are basically the same scent, and arguably should not be occupying multiple ranking spots in the list above other more original fragrances. I will not be reordering my rankings as they currently stand, they are an accurate reflection of my feelings towards the scents. However, after I wrap up this review series I will be reviewing a retrospective where I take Artistry and creativity into account for ranking more than my own personal preferences. I feel this is only fair to some of the fantastic fragrance work that may not be getting quite enough credit as things stand now.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed week 9 of the Tobacco Throwdown, and I look forward to bringing you another review next weekend!",

Clove? smell and didn't last long enough for me. Stirling haverford is my number one shave scent of all time. I have it in everything they sell and body butter for it is coming out very soon I'm told. I have my finger on the order button. I have a shelf full of tobacco vanille scents.. Stirling Haverford takes the cake for me. #1. Also if you keep haverford on the shelf.. the EDT and aftershave changes and gets darker and deeper. Purchase dates are below the bottles of aftershave.

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much. Would repurchase the other 2 probably but none of them made me go WOW. \n\nMeanwhile I’m still hoarding the tiny sample of the skinceuticals cream I got and it’s been my go-to whenever I get a random dry patch.

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on. But if it's out of budge liek way off then keep your search on😅 for me it's cleansers. Ppl spend thr least on it but for me the perfect cleanser was something I badly needed. Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to create a space to discuss the new reformulation of Stratia's Interface moisturizer, and how it compares to Drunk Elephant's Protini. The new Stratia formula seems quite similar to Protini, at a much lower price point. It launched last week, so I imagine most people haven't been able to try it out yet, but if you have - please share your experiences as well! There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

Kinda went crazy with my own recipe even though I’m still fairly new.\n\nIt was a bit overwhelming because I felt like I had to work fast between stick blending and pouring into the slab. My colored soaps started to set in the pouring pitchers as they were getting stick blended and I waited until right before pouring to add fragrance. Is it possible that I used too much shea butter?\n\nIt’s possible I may have also over-mixed because it looked like a pretty thick trace.. like gloppy pudding instead of a flowy batter. I wish I had taken pictures but again, I was feeling rushed lol. Is it advised to undermix for an easier pour/this technique? I was worried it wouldn’t reach trace. Aesthetically I also probably should have poured the white last to add more contrast against all the dark colors. \n\nOverall I’m happy that I got some kind of swirl! I’m trying to embrace the mistakes and remember that the soap is still usable even if it’s not what I envisioned (that is if it’s still safe to use). Obviously I could’ve done a much smaller batch but I was too excited to use the dividers.. :)\n\nRecipe: 75oz\n\n40% lard\n25% sweet almond oil\n25% shea butter\n7% jojoba oil\n3% castor oil\n\n2.25 oz Bramble Berry fragrance\n6 tsp sodium lactate (I think I fudged on this and put a tad too much?)\n\n8% superfat\n40% lye concentration \n\nThis was also my first time going this high on lye. I did 33% on all my previous batches and I always got a ton of soda ash. I had a feeling it had to do with my city’s hard water even though I have an RODI filter. I also sprayed with 99% isopropyl alcohol and left it covered in the oven (off and overnight) after pre-heating at 175.\n\nI know I was making a huge gamble with this big of a batch but only time will tell once I unmold these bars to see if it was worth it. I will post another picture once I do!\n\nOpen to any tips on how to better prepare for more advanced techniques like this or what I could have changed about the batter setting too soon before pouring. I’m still playing around with recipe percentages and different oils & butters so any advice is greatly appreciated!",

        "body": "That much Shea butter likely isn't helping the thick trace issue, but people newer to soaping do tend to over blend as well, and with a tight lye water ratio, you blend even less. Shea is high in stearic acid, which makes it thicken the batter at a faster rate than some of the other hard oils. I find my bars are too waxy for my taste with that much Shea, but everyone has their own preferences and others like it just fine. The lard probably helped you out though, as it slows things down. \n\nI use a 40% lye concentration, and I manage swirls just fine, so I personally think its worth it to try to work with that ratio if soda ash is a problem. I would personally lower the Shea and up the lard, and just be much more judicious with the stick blending. Get the batter to trace and then do much more hand stirring from there. Patience is your friend when it comes to stick blending.\n\nThat being said, the thicker trace likely helped you keep the colors from getting too muddy. Trace can be a bit of a dance with swirls, depending on the goals for your soap design. Too thick, and you risk not getting a good swirl and air pockets trapped in the soap become a risk, but too thin and the colors can bleed into each other in a way you may not like and your colors can get muddied. \n\nYou won't know about the true swirl and air pockets until demolding, but from this view your soap looks absolutely lovely and is a gorgeous example of a swirl. I really like the crisp delineation of the colors here. You'll have to wait to see what you think about the properties of the soap itself to see of you want to change the recipe, but from my view, this looks fabulous!",

Similar issues on my back, mostly closed comedones (clogged pores) and scarring from them.\n\n🦋 **Climate:** Mumbai monsoon. Ranges from slightly cool to slightly warm, humid.\n\n🦋 **Current routine:**\n\nI avoid using shower gel or anything on my back, just plain water. No moisturizer, either (I just do my arms and legs). And use just this glycolic toner on my back on alternate days.\n\n🦋 **Age:** Early 30s\n\n🦋 **Usage timeline:** From Dec 2022 to Oct 2023, used twice a week at first, then alternate days. Finished the 200ml bottle.\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \n\nAqua/​Water, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Tocopherol, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Aloe Vera Extract, Oat Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, D-Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Lactate, Propanediol, Xylitol, Erythritol, Maltitol, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride\n\nNotably contains \"17 amino acids\", and a couple soothing ingredients. pH is a low, low 3.6. \n\nI have the old packaging, which unfortunately listed the ingredients out of order, but hopefully the new one corrected that issue.\n\n🦋 **Price:** MRP ₹549 for 200ml, currently available for ₹429 on Amazon. Also available in 100ml pack.\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\nHas no added fragrance, but smells distinctly acidic, like apple cider vinegar. Smell doesn't linger, and dissipates fast (can't speak for use on the face), but it may be a turn-off for some people. Not a spa experience, almost medicinal 😂\n\nIt's a watery consistency. A yellow-brown tinted liquid.\n\n🦋 Packaging - a twisting nozzle-top bottle. Very convenient. Easy to use, you can change the rate of dispensing with how much you twist it open (perfect for the watery texture) - all the pros of the Ordinary product (AFAIK) at a lower cost. \n\n#✨️Effects\n\nSinks in fairly quickly on towel-dried skin, and doesn't stain or affect clothing in any way. It's pretty strong, so any scratches or broken skin sting for a bit when applied - getting a little on my underarms post shaving is an immediate emergency rinse 🥵\n\nOver the course of a couple months, it largely resolved my comedonal back acne, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and overall texture on my back. My skin heals pretty slow, so people may see faster results. I still have some comedones, texture etc. on my back, but I'm satisfied with it as is. I think that's realistic results for acne-prone skin. \n\nIt hasn't done much for scar tissue bumps from the ocassional cyst, maybe just softened their appearance slightly.\n\n#✨️My experience and final thoughts\n\nHaving used a spray product for bacne before, I much prefer this packaging. I have mild hand dexterity issues, a spray nozzle gets hard to press repeatedly. As convenient as it sounds in theory, it was also hard to position it so the spray would get on the right areas. This product is easy to just dribble over your shoulders and down your back, then spread with your hands. \n\nThe results were what I expected, so I'm satisfied.\n\n🦋 **Repurchase status:**\n\nWRP - just placed an order for a new one 😂 5/5 for body acne. I'm very basic when it comes to body care, and this is a seamless part of my routine now.\n\nI can't speak to use on the face, of course. It's quite a strong product, and I currently prefer using the Minimalist 10% AHA serum on my face, because it's gentler and has a nicer texture and overall experience. \n\nHope this was interesting and/or helpful ☺️ Byee!",

A&E's name comes from Peter's daughter's middle name Ariana and his own, Evans. A&E splits its production into its own brand and a separate but related membership- only brand, The Club.  The Club started out commissioning soaps, scents, and splashes from other artisans in the community,but now A&E produces its own products. Ariana & Evans has been somewhat controversial in the wetshaving community for the consistent use of scantily-clad women and sexually suggestive imagery in its label artwork, using preformulated scents, and the ridiculousness of needing to pay for the privilege of buying soap as is The Club's business model. Despite any controversy,  though, A&E has been well known for exceptional performance and strong fragrancing.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Vanille de Tabac comes in a nice solid translucent tub that seems similar to the ones used by Stirling Soaps, just translucent not green. The tub is adorned with one of the aforementioned controversial labels, a pinup girl posing seductively on a cigar. I don't personally mind this label and actually enjoy the art. But I understand why some would, especially since this type of art appears on many of its products.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Vanille de Tabac is a duplicate of Tom Ford's Tobacco Vanilla, very similar to Highland Springs Soap Comoany's Havana Vieja which I reviewed earlier in this series.VdT is described as:  a smooth oriental, opening immediately with opulent essences of tob*cco leaf and aromatic spice notes. The heart unfolds with creamy tonka bean, tob*cco flower, vanilla and cocoa and finishes with dry fruit accord enriched with sweet wood sap. \n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scent notes in Vanille de Tabac are listed as: *tobacco leaf, tonka bean, ginger spices, cocoa, and fruit*. Vanilla is not listed as a scent note nor is the sweet wood sap mentioned in the description.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For me the scent opens with a very thin vanilla note followed by a whiff of cinammon that moves into an air of tangy fruit and cocoa before immediately diving deep into a dark and spicy tobacco note. The tobacco here is relatively natural based on my college aged rcollections of swisher sweets. It gets very spicy and funky, delving almost as deep into that territory as the actual Tom Ford scent but with a lot less oomph. Vanille de Tabac comes across as more natural than HSSX Havana Vieja and I think the de-emphasis on the vanilla note is a large reason why. Jumping quickly through aromatics into the tobacco note really grounds the scent. I also want to add that the spice of the tobacco note comes through a lot more clearly in Ariana & Evans Kaizen soap base than it does in most other tobacco soaps I have reviewed here and tried elsewhere. I know soap is not a true or pure medium for scent and I appreciate that achievement. The matching splash brings out a hair more vanilla but is otherwise the same. The scent on this splash is very strong and will easily stick around all day, which I love.\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanille de Tabac is in A&E's Kaizen base and while I beleive the company is now on Kaizen 2, the Kaizen base is still its most available for most products. \n\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaizen's ingredients are listed as: *Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Aqua, Goats Milk, Potassium Hydroxide,  Kokum Butter, Shea Butter, Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Manteca, Aloe Juice, Avocado Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Apricot Kernal Seed Oil, Lanolin, Agave, Slippery Elm, Sodium Lactate, Xanthan Gum, Silk Amino Acid, Tussah Silk, and Marshmallow Root.*\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&E's Kaizen base is frankly a stellar performer with its only close competition coming from Wholly Kaw and their Siero Base, and maybe Declaration Grooming's MilkSteak base too. Kaizen is very easy to lather; despite benefitting from a lot of water the lather comes together quickly and easily. Kaizen still performs better than average when underhydrated and can handle a ton of water before breaking down. Cushion, slickness, residual slickness, and post shave feel are all top notch. I could honestly do two passes on my head as well as touch ups with only one application of lather with no real issues, but I will admit heads are a little easier to shave. \n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&E's ' Skin Food' splash is nice and refreshing too. Skin food's ingredients are: *Aloe Vera Juice, Vegetable Glycerin, SD 40B Alcohol, Rose Hydrosol, Calendula Extract , Red Clover Extract, Chamomile, Plantain Leaves, White Willow Bark, Vitamin E, Caprylic Triglycerides ( combination of plant sugars and fatty acids derived from palm and coconut oils for silkier feel and as a natural preservative)*\n\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is refreshing and light and very similar to Noble Otter's splash and is bested by Zingariman recovery splash which is just a bit lighter and more refreshing. A&E skin food is still a great splash and I personally enjoy the heavy perfuming.\n\n\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the other soaps I have reviewed so far Vanille de Tabac comes out on top in both scent and performance for this reviewer. I personally really enjoy the balance of the scent here, despite being a dupe, it is very well executed. The vanilla is toned down to a level where its presence is just noticed and the aromatics of fruit and chocolate add an air of complexity to an otherwise simple scent. The tobacco itself is very dark and dirty without being overly dry and brings quite a lot of spice to the picture which suits my personal taste. I like that VdT is a more natural version of Havana Vieja and brings more punch than Cognac and Cuban Cigars.

And whether it's preformulated or not Vanille de Tabac is a fantastic scent. A&E has some issues, but I do think that Kaizen base is worth a shot and A&E probably has a scent you would like. That said I have toned down my enthusiasm for their products since learning more about their controversies (I'd totally buy a bottle of Dirty Ginger AS Splash if you have one to sell though).\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I hope you all have enjoyed this segment of the Tobacco Throwdown, I will be back with another this weekend!\n\n\n*I purchased these products on my own and I am in no way affiliated with Ariana and Evans*",

        "body": "Thank you so much for the review. I really appreciate it and glad you enjoyed the soap. Controversial is not necessarily a bad thing, but I do understand how some feel about the pinup series (our take on the Varga pinup girls of the 50’s). Some will be happy to know that I’m phasing those labels out, although I really love Vacanza Romana, so I may keep that. Otherwise, I invite anyone to visit our site and report back what is offensive. Ohhh, I won’t be changing the label on Vanille de Tabac, which I think is fine. Yes, I do have a model Justine and may do another photoshoot for a different line, so hope you guys don’t find her so offensive. We are growing and in the beginning I must admit, I wanted to turn heads and get noticed (marketing), with the understanding that some would find it a bit less than tasteful. I was willing to take that risk. I have no regrets for that decision. Strictly from a business perspective it was the right move initially. Now time to standardize a bit more, but we will continue pushing the envelope as that’s just what we do and who I am. Love me or hate me, there’s nothing quite like our brand and brand differentiation is critical. All that said, thank you once again. I’m honored to be here.",

    "body": "Greetings fellow Redditors and Doctors! As the title suggests my nephew is suffering from vomiting and high temperature ranging from 100-103 over past few days (6 days to be exact). So, it started with a vomiting, before which he was perfectly fine and active showing no symptom of any disease. After sometime he drank water and immediately vomited again. Been given Syp. Motilium (Domperidone) which he threw out as well. In short, he vomited 6 times in those 3 hours. Meanwhile, his body was warmer than usual and the thermometer was hitting 100 on the Celsius scale. Took him to the Doc who injected him with Oxidil (Ceftriaxone) 500mg along with Flagyl (Metronidazole) via DNS drip, and given Syp Panadol and Syp. Motilium (Domperidone). His condition remained same till next day besides his temperature increased to 103 and the vomiting continued (he would vomit even if he drank one sip of water); the same treatment continued for the next day. Seeing him not getting any better, we took him to another Doctor whose prescriptions I have attached below in the photos. Nevertheless, I’ll mention here in text as well what he injected him with (details of which you can see in the prescription photo attached). It was Inbufin (Ibuprofen) (400ma/100ml), then Medisol (compound sodium lactate, intravenous infusion BP (Ringer-lactate) 500ml alongwith onset injection mixed into it. Besides that, he prescribed Merisol (Meropenum USP) (500mg/vial) injection twice a day, Decadron (Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate USP) (4mg/ml), Gen-M (Artesunate) (30mg). This was the third day of his treatment but he wasn’t showing a sign of recovery instead he started to show neuropsychiatric signs (such as calling his mother with a different name, becoming extremely fearful, making facial expressions that he doesn’t normally do, and shouting; I cannot explain for the lack of better words), and he slept very little and kept crying for as long as he remained awake, with an atrabilious behavior. So at the night the doctor had to give him tablet valium (Diazepam) 3mg, after which he could sleep for only 4 hours and woke up crying and continued crying. On this day his vomiting stoped and for some hours his temperature was showing normal (which again rose to 100 that day, and to 102 the next day). We stayed there for two days but discontinued because things were not getting better. The next day we took him to another doctor who prescribed different medications (I’ll attach this in the photos and write Doc #3 on the photo). We are back home now, he was active in the day but he has started to vomit again (he vomited 5 times previous night). I am here to ask what do y’all have to say about this -and what do you suggest?",

Ideally this should include inpatient admission, and it's not clear to me from what you wrote that he's had an inpatient stay, or if that's even an option.  \n\nChanges in mental status can mean many things:  dehydration / shock from all the vomiting and lack of intake, a central nervous system infection like meningitis, the systemic effects of a more severe infection like sepsis, the effects of the 8 million medicines they've given him, among others.  \n\nBut he's also seen multiple doctors who keep discharging him, so perhaps he's just recovering from gastroenteritis and dehydration and the vomiting is just taking longer than usual to completely resolve (which is common in younger children).",

(https://www.stirlingsoap.com/) is a veteran owned artisan founded in January, 2012 by owners, Roderick and Amanda Lovan. The company is focused on high quality offerings for budget friendly prices with regards to grooming and accouterments. They also focus on staying environmentally conscious with their product making processes. Stirling Soap Co.’s offerings can be purchased direct or at third party resellers like Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStirling Noir represents Stirling Soap Co.’s version of the famed Drakkar Noir cologne. The fragrance features notes of: Oakmoss, Leather, Lavender, Fir, Sandalwood, Lemon, Vetiver and Geranium. The scent is spot on in its representation of the cologne. This aromatic fougere is both green but also has a darkness to it. It will remind you of the late 80’s/early 90’s when it was one of the most commonly worn colognes, by high school boys. Mrs. Ruds isn’t a fan of Drakkar Noir and as such, not a fan of this scent. Scent strength is strong out of the container and remains this way through lathering. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Viking Shaving Soap Valhalla and Mickey Lee Soapworks Pantie Dropper. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStirling Soap Co. uses a tallow based soap featuring the following ingredients: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate. The soap base is in the middle of the firmness spectrum and loads with ease. The soap is thirsty and the lather created with proper hydration will be the consistency of Greek yogurt. I have been using Stirling Soap Co. more and more because their scents are mostly in Mrs. Ruds wheelhouse. Through more familiarity and better hydration technique, I have come to find it better than previously rated. Slickness is excellent, both in terms of primary slickness and residual slickness. Post shave leaves the skin well hydrated and feeling silky once lather is rinsed away. The post shave is excellent. Given the improvements in my technique lathering this, the new ShaveScore for Stirling Soap Co. is a 91. For similar soap performance I suggest: First Line Shave and Oleo Soapworks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Stirling Soap Co.

    "body": "The ingredient list is the most honest part of any beauty product. It tells you exactly what you’re putting on your skin.\n\nHow Ingredient Lists Are Structured\n- Ingredients are listed in descending order of concentration. The first five ingredients usually make up the bulk of the product and largely determine its effects.\n- Ingredients used at concentrations below 1% can be listed in any order, but not before those above 1%\n- Ingredients are often listed by their INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) name, sometimes followed by their common or botanical name in brackets.\n- “Aqua” or water is commonly the first ingredient, making up 75–80% of many formulations. \n\nHow to Read and Interpret Ingredient Lists\n\n- Focus on the First Five Ingredients- These ingredients are present in the highest concentrations and have the most impact on your skin.\n- Identify Key Actives, Popular actives in India include Vitamin C, retinol, glycolic acid, niacinamide, and traditional ingredients like turmeric, neem, and sandalwood\n- Parabens, sulfates, and mineral oil, Fragrance and Alcohol and certain harmful substances like mercury, lead, and arsenic in cosmetics\n- Look for certifications such as “dermatologically tested,” “non-comedogenic,” “clinically proven,” and compliance with Indian standards like BIS\n\n Decoding Label Claims and Certifications\n\n- Dermatologically Tested: Tested for skin compatibility, but not always a guarantee for everyone.\n- Non-Comedogenic: Won’t clog pores-important for oily or acne-prone skin.\n- Clinically Proven: Backed by studies but check if the studies are credible.\nBIS Compliance: Indicates the product meets Indian safety and quality standards.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLet’s apply these steps to our two snail mucin products:\n\n1. Focus on the First Five Ingredients\n\n- COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence:\nThe very first ingredient is Snail Secretion Filtrate (96%). This means the product is truly centered around snail mucin and you’ll get the maximum benefit from it.\n\n- Riyo Herbs Snail 98 Mucin Essence:\nThe first five ingredients are Water, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Lactate. Snail Secretion Filtrate appears only as the sixth ingredient, suggesting a much lower concentration.\n\n\n\n\n2. Watch Out for Red Flags\n\n- COSRX:\nNo fragrance, no harsh preservatives, and no alcohols-making it suitable for sensitive skin.\n- Riyo Herbs:\nContains Perfume (fragrance) and Imid Urea (a formaldehyde-releasing preservative), both of which can irritate sensitive or allergy-prone skin, especially in India’s climate.\nTakeaway:\nAvoid products with fragrance or harsh preservatives high up in the list if you have sensitive skin.\n\n\n\n\nAs you saw with the COSRX and Riyo Herbs snail mucin example, the ingredient list quickly reveals the true nature of a product-helping you cut through marketing hype, avoid harmful ingredients, and choose products that genuinely benefit your skin.\n\nAlways check the ingredient list, not just the front label. Your skin will thank you!\n\n\n ",

If you see the listing of the same products according to US regulations you'll suddenly find the hero ingredient listed lower, not the 1st ingredient.\n\nDespite Cosmetic regulations in India stating that ingredients should be listed in order of concentration, the supervision regarding proper application is lax, so Kbeauty brands get away with listing extracts as a first ingredient instead of listing the whole thing.",

There is just an overwhelming array of artisans on the scene, Noble Otter just hadn't made it to my radar.  Fortunately, a fellow wet shaver gave me a heads-up regarding this limited release, and I snagged a set.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the artisan acquiesced to a small faction of followers who were pining for a dupe of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb EdT.  While the quaint hand-drawn modification of their label intended for the unscented offering, \"Bare\", is charming, it's my understanding moves are being made to have more professional labels for future limited offerings.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, the container is a standard rigid ~~89~~ 100 mm Parkway polypropylene tub holding approximately 4 oz. of product topped with a matching threaded lid.  The satin-finish waterproof labels are straight and devoid of blemish or bubbles.  The art is crisp and the text is easy to read.  The overall design is both classy and whimsical, the focal point of which obviously being the austere otter.  In the regular offerings, the otter's attire is reportedly indicative of the respective fragrance.  Perhaps it's been done elsewhere, but this aspect is reminiscent of Zoologist's scheme.  My only critique would be that the actual Noble Otter brand name and stylized logo is small and somewhat difficult to feature in a SOTD photograph unless one employs a macro shot.  Of course, the understated text is probably by-design in keeping with the formal presentation.  The aftershave splash is the standard 4 oz. glass amber apothecary bottle with ribbed threaded black lid that was secured with a break-away safety seal.\n\nOff the tub, the scent strength is quite light, but it essentially doubles (I refuse to say \"explodes\") upon lathering, opening with a fresh spicy clean resin topped by a lemony citrus enveloped by a rounded floral that stops just short of rose.  The fragrance warms up with time revealing a leathery tobacco with wisps of cinnamon, never becoming heavy.  The paired splash presents similarly, but certainly sharper bergamot in the opening.  The spiciness is more distinct in the splash, and this phase obviously lasts longer before warming up.  The leather and tobacco, while still present in the splash's dry down aren't as easily separated suggesting a skilled blending.  After about three hours, I begin to lose the fragrance just as the cinnamon steps in.  There is also a final smoky sweetness in the vanilla realm.  I think I went nose blind at the four-hour mark because I could no longer detect it, but my wife did. \n\nI have no experience with target fragrance, so I can't speak to the accuracy.  I did, however find it to be pleasant enough that I'm entertaining the thought of picking up a bottle of the Spicebomb EdT or the \"Extreme\" variant EdP.  My limited research suggests the two versions do differ in more than strength, so if someone can tell me which fragrance more closely matches Kaboom!, I'd appreciate it.\n\nIn terms of performance, if not for the thirst, this beef tallow base could pass for a Talbot shaving creation, loading and lathering in a very similar nature.  Noble Otter functions with moderate hydration, yielding a voluminous thick lather similar to high-butter vegan bases like that of PAA's Crown King base.  However, if you stop here, there is a bit of spackling which is a good indicator that more water will optimize it.  Prior to the shave, test palm lathers proved this base can handle a fair bit of water thereby achieving elite levels of slickness, so I proceeded to push the water for the head and face lathering.  Slickness is competitive with any soap I've tried.  Residual slickness takes that up a notch more such that long sweeping scalp passes were easily obtained on residual slickness alone.  Being a shower shaver, I'm less concerned with where the lather falls, but with this kind of slickness, my carelessness made the all metal Schick injector a little precarious to hold on to.  This is incredible slickness despite my hard water.\n\nThe post shave is also similar to Talbot's and Catie's Bubbles' jojoba bases.  That is to say, the post shave is spectacular, requiring no post-product whatsoever. Thus the splash was simply about continuing the experience.  I was surprised with how the splash was distributed.  Using only a couple in my palm to spread on my dome and face, my hand glided as if the splash were mostly oil.  I anticipated at least some degree of greasiness, but instead, it soaked right in leaving a silky smooth, natural feel.  I searched the ingredients for something like glycerin, but it's not there.  This surprising slickness could be attributed to reconstitution of the soap base, but I thoroughly rinse in the shower and towel dry before I apply aftershave, so I fine that to be unlikely.\n\nUltimately, this was a perfect shave both in terms of enjoyable fragrance and high-level performance.\n\n*DISCLOSURE:  I purchased the aforementioned products for retail price directly from the artisan's web site.  I received no gifts or other incentives in return for my comments.*\n\nSOAP INGREDIENTS: stearic acid, beef tallow, coconut milk, aloe vera, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, castor oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, lanolin, tucuma seed butter, kokum butter, sodium hydroxide, bentonite clay, tocopheral acetate, citric acid, watermelon extract, whitewillow bark extract, tussah silk.*\n\nAFTERSHAVE INGREDIENTS:  denatured alcohol, witch hazel, water, sodium lactate, panthenol, carrot extract, chamomile extract, seaweed extract.*\n\n*Fragrance is an assumed ingredient. As previously stated, the labels are from the \"Bare\" unscented variety and have been modified by hand to accommodate this limited fragrance.\n\nBONUS PIC:  https://i.imgur.com/cMRQNYR.jpg",

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

To be fair I've already been using vit c's daily prior to trying this formula so there's not much more brightening I can reasonably expect at this point.\n\nYou can absolutely see the colour change as it oxidizes, it was red when I first got it, now it's more orange (colour started changing at around week 5). It's been [hypothesized that glutathione protects against oxidized vit c radicals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-7424-3_11), which I found quite interesting, so I gave the serum a shot. \n\nI tested it with my pH strips and it has a pH of around 3.\n\nAlso interesting is that I didn't get a flush from the LAA/niacinamide combo. Previously I had used Purito's c serum and that caused Kim Kardashian vampire facial level of flushing. When I started using the serum, there was a very strong prickling sensation, but no redness or itching. I persevered and it went away by the 4th day, although I find that if my face is damp upon application, I'll still get some prickling/ tingling. For that reason I use this prior to any toners and always once my face is dry after cleansing.\n\nI haven't tried the OST vit c, so I wouldn't be able to tell you how it compares to that. The other LAA serums I have tried are Skinceuticals ce ferulic (greasy and smells like hot dogs) and Purito (extreme red flushing). I have sensitive atopic skin (which is under control right now thank god), combination normal skin with slightly oily t-zone.",

I was under the impression that the LAA version of Vitamin C should not be used in conjunction with/at the same time as Niacinamide. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that the two ingredients had a canceling-each-other out effect.\n\nAlso, I've used the original Tiam C and it was super strong and nothing like the Vitamin C serum that I'm using now (Skin Actives) in terms of how tingly it feels applied to the skin, so I feel like Tiam is doing something right. (?)\n\nLastly, glutathione itself/alone has been shown to have some anti-aging activity IN ADDITION to its known brightening/whitening qualities. It's supposed to be an extremely potent antioxidant (I supplement with it daily.) I've actually been looking for skincare products with glutathione in them but haven't found much other than a ridiculously expensive serum from Perricone and a couple things from Skin Actives, hence my interest in this product.",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/Jlqlyzj7Oio)\n\nZingari Man (https://www.zingariskin.com/) is the men’s line of shave offerings from Zingari Skincare. The artisan, Heather Melton is a certified Cosmetic formulator through the Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild. To celebrate the company’s one year anniversary, Zingari Man released their Sego tallow soap base. The artisan’s focus is on nurturing your skin through the use of vitamins and minerals proven in skin health. The Zingari Man line offers shaving soap, post shave, beard care and skin care for a complete grooming experience. Zingari Man can be purchased direct from the site or at; Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/).  \n\nThe Explorer is an homage to the fragrance Bvlgari Man Wood Essence. This masculine fragrance features notes of; Citrus, Coriander, Cypress, Vetiver, Benzoin, Cedarwood and Ambergris. This is a fresh, clean scent that is approachable and safe. The top of the accord is bright citrus that is complimented by a woody middle and anchored by an ambergris base. Mrs. Ruds approves of this smell for all occasions. I had suspected this would be in her wheelhouse. Strength of scent is light to mid out of the jar and remains this way for the duration of lathering and shaving. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Stirling Soap Co. Stirling For Him as a similar scent profile.  \n\nZingari Man Sego is the company’s first tallow based soap offering. The tallow base is lanolin free for those with a sensitivity to lanolin in mind. The base features ingredients of: Stearic acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Beef tallow, Shea butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor oil, Palm oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Jojoba oil, Oat bran oil, Shea butter (and) Glyceral Rosinate (and) Olive oil unsaponifiables, Coconut oil, Daikon Seed extract, Goat milk, Coconut milk, Sodium lactate. This base mid-firm and loads without a lot of effort. This base requires a lot of water, a lot more than most soap offerings that you may be used to. When dialed in, the lather will have a consistency similar to Greek yogurt. Slickness is now in the elite class in terms of both primary and residual slickness. Post shave, like slickness is elite. The post shave rivals even the most nourishing offerings in the current soap market. The overall improvements to previous base offerings by Zingari Man are evident and welcomed. Zingari Man Sego receives a ShaveScore of 99. For similar performance from a soap base, I suggest; Ariana & Evans or Barrister and Mann.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Zingari Man The Explorer (purchased) \n* Brush - Mocek \"Green Tea\" w/ 24mm Maggard SHD (purchased)\n* Razor - Gold Dollar W60 (PIF)\n* Post - Zingari Man The Explorer (purchased)",

It could also be because its notoriously difficult to find ingredients list for Lotus products - they are not mentioned on any retailer & even Lotus' own website. They are printed on the products, but unless you see them in store/in person you wouldn't know. \n\n3. Lotus likes to harp on about natural ingredients as hero ingredient which are often not a majority constituent of their product. That along with hard to find inci list puts it into Biotique adjacent category for many people. Natural isn't trendy anymore, science is. Lotus isn't catering to the growing skincare conscious demographic anymore. \n\n4. Lack of proper reviews of current products leads people to not check out the brand & there continues the vicious cycle, so Lotus keeps getting written off. \n\nBut aside from that from what I've observed people like shitting on the brand as a whole without trying much from it. In my very subjective opinion, people hate legacy brands because ghar ki murgi dal barabar (tl : the chicken at home is considered equal to Dal ; ie familiarity breeds contempt). You'll see the trend across Lakmé, Lotus, Lacto Calamine, Nature's Essence etc. Most people either hate them or write them off as relics of yesteryears. \n\nMany people feel victimised by how mass market Indian brands championed fair skin with white beauty etc type names, so they've grown averse to such brands as a whole.\n\nFor some reason this doesn't apply to massy brands of foreign origin that are guilty of same things like Ponds.

    "body": "I love MBD sheet masks, but I’ve always suspected that they are not actually that different from one another, even though there are lots of different types that [supposedly have different properties.](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+beauty+diary+masks&espv=2&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=vLF3VL6dGvKHsQSF24C4BQ&ved=0CDYQsAQ&biw=1093&bih=514) I compared the ingredients in 12 of the masks and wanted to share my findings and solicit the opinions of others. All ingredient data comes from Amazon.com or Makeup Alley, so it might be imperfect.\n\n*My questions for you:* Are any of these ingredients especially noteworthy? Do you think there are any functional differences between the masks?\n\n*Observations:* The top 5 ingredients in all of the masks are nearly identical, although they appear in different orders on the list, indicating that there may be more or less of them in different masks. They are: **Purified water, Glycerin(e), 1,3-Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel/Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice/Aloe Extract.** (Not sure of the differences between the aloe ingredients, I'm counting them as one item for the purposes of this comparison.)\n\nA few masks had a unique item in their top 5 ingredients.

I personally have not come to a conclusion on reactions from long term exposure to fragrance, whether citrus extracts increase photosensitivity, and the effectiveness of formulas with lots of plant extracts like here. When I saw how much phenoxyethanol the Imperial Bird's Nest contains I was immediately turned off. \n\nApple polyphenol seems low in irritants and Aloe is high in sodium hyaluronate.\n\nMBD is a very established mask brand in Taiwan. They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD. I haven't looked at any of them.

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/qDAoTGJaeUQ)\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts (https://southernwitchcrafts.com/) is an artisan soap and aftershave maker based in Georgia. The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts (https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/). Samhain is SWs fall 2019 offering and will release on September 24, 2019. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nSamhain is a blend of; bourbon, tobacco, pumpkin, sandalwood, nutmeg, oud, incense, amber, vanilla, hazelnut, charred wood, musk. The fragrances is inspired by the “Gaelic festival marking the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter”. This scent is a perfect autumn scent that open with smells of pumpkin, vanilla and bourbon, before the slight spice of nutmeg rolls through. From there, the scent is enveloped in a nutty, resinous blanket. The entire presentation is grounded by a woodiness. Mrs. Ruds likes this scent, likely because of her affinity for New England falls and pumpkin spice offerings. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and remains this way for the shaves duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends  Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Atomic Pumpkin as a comparable scent profile.\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Samhain (purchased)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers “Scorpion” (purchased)\n* Razor - Jerry Stark #502 (gift)\n* Post - Southern Witchcrafts Samhain (purchased)",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 9th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Barrister and Mann Barrister's Reserve Spice](https://i.imgur.com/wicKqBi.jpg)\n\n*A note: Unlike most of the previous dupes I had actually used Barrister and Mann before, though not the Omnibus base. I had enjoyed my shaves with them but never found the soaps all that great for me so I went into this with a bit of a previous bias.*\n\nAnd so we come to what might be the most popular Old Spice dupe out there. We're not anywhere near the end here but my selection has been random and Barrister and Mann's Barrister's Reserve Spice (I guess saying Barrister once wasn't enough) is up next and it is, along with Stirling Spice, the soap that most people point you towards when you're looking for a dupe. u/BostonPhotoTourist, whose name annoyingly has nothing to do with shaving, has clearly made something people like here but I'm not people so maybe my opinion will differ. You'll actually have to read words to find out...\n\nNot really. There are numbers. You can just look at the numbers.\n\nReserve Spice (I'm not typing Barrister's anymore) seems to be going for a straight dupe, though its description doesn't even mention the words Old Spice. There's a little bit of play with the scent, I think, but it isn't trying anything new. As the description says, this is a vintage scent that your grandpa would wear or maybe your great-grandpa -- we're getting further and further away from when OG Old Spice was on the shelves. Carnation, nutmeg, vanilla, and tonka bean are listed as the scent notes and you can definitely get the nutmeg and carnation in there with plenty of spiciness coming off. It's lacking some of the citrus notes that other dupes have featured and the \"soapy/powdery\" base that I associate Old Spice with definitely takes a back seat.\n\nThis is the much-hyped Omnibus base featuring Aqua (Water), Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Tallowate, Parfum (Fragrance Oil), Sodium Stearate, Garcinia indica Seed Butter (Potassium Kokum Butterate), Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Cocos nucifera Fruit Juice (Coconut Milk), Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) Butter, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma grandiflorum (Cupuaçu) Seed Butter, Sodium Cocoa (Kokum) Butterate, Potassium Cocoate, Hydroxethylcellulose, Sodium Ricinolate, Saccharide Isomerate, Caprae Lac (Goat Milk) Powder, Persea gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sodium Cocoate, Althaea officinalis (Marshmallow) Root Extract, Ulmus rubra (Slippery Elm) Extract. Goat milk again... my old friend. Also of note is the Marshmallow extract, which will come into play in my lather description.\n\nThe soap itself is not soft or hard but... you know... in between. If someone asked me how hard a shaving soap is this is the hardness I'd think of.\n\nIf you'd like to read my first shave with the soap you can find them here: [Shave 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/us64ii/comment/i957yr9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [Shave 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/utmoiu/comment/i9bsdzz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\n**Oldness: 4**\n\nStraight off the puck, this is definitely an Old Spice scent. Opening it up and taking a whiff would give anyone a hit to the nostrils of vintage Old Spice for sure. It's good and for many I think it might be the exact Old Spice they remember. However, I think it actually leans a bit more towards modern Old Spice. The soapy base is missing here leaving just a slight change to the scent that makes it a bit more modern in its take than the OG Old Spice. That may be part of the reason it's so popular because it's kept the scent but also made it feel just slightly more modern. The scent stays consistent throughout the shave.\n\n**Spiciness: 4**\n\nDespite the \"update\" to the scent this is still a vintage Old Spice scent and it conjures all the same scent memories that Old Spice should. Opening the puck is indeed like stepping into Grandpa's bathroom and the scent lasts so well throughout the shave that the feeling never leaves. There's something expressly masculine about the way the scent hits the nose while you're shaving and lingers around the bathroom. While it isn't quite the Old Spice of memory it is really something quite nostalgic.\n\n[**Lather: 5**](https://i.imgur.com/SghdbB1.jpg)\n\nBlown away by the lather on this omnibus base, which is saying something since I came into this expecting to have the same opinion as I did with my non-Omnibus samples. This stuff lathers like nothing I've seen. It's nearly impossible to get bubbles in it and you'd have to dump a gallon of water in to even try to break it. Getting it where you want it is as easy as a simple precision lather and once it's there it's thick, runny, and fantastic. The only weird thing, and I'm not even taking a point off, is that during the lathering process it becomes something akin to melted marshmallow, which I'm now thinking is from the literal marshmallow extract that's in the soap. It looks weird as the soap kind of sticks and stretches, but once you get enough water in the effect is gone and I'm guessing it adds to the fantastic cushion by keeping things structured.\n\n**Shave: 5**\n\nOmnibus is effing legit, though you probably didn't need yet another wet shaving degeneret to tell you that. Somehow slick and cushiony with a residual slickness that seems to last forever, the shave is just fantastic all around. No matter what razor I used it simply slid perfectly, with issues only stemming from me being careless because it felt so good. Maybe a little less quality, Will? You know, so I have to pay some attention?\n\n**Post: 3**\n\nPost-shave is really the only place where Reserve Spice hits the middle ground. The post-shave is absolutely fine but it's nothing more. The scent never lingered that long throughout the day despite how strong it is during the shave (and my other B&M scents being some of the best at sticking around). I will say that it mingles wonderfully with the Indian Old Spice, layering together fantastically and reaffirming my belief that it leans more towards a vintage version of the modern-day take. However, it gets completely lost in my OG Old Spice scent. Maybe that's from the similar scents mingling too much but other on-the-nose soaps complimented OG Old Spice instead of disappearing in it so I don't really like how it does. Skin feel after shave was usually good but never spectacular, despite the Goat Milk!\n\n**Final Verdict: 21**\n\nAs I said, coming into this I thought I'd be all edgy and come out saying things like B&M is good but not great. Well, that's just wrong. It's great. Omnibus delivers what might be the best lather and shave combo out there I've tried so far and Reserve Spice's scent is both a great dupe and just different enough to bring something new. I wish it stuck around a little bit more but that's hardly a complaint when the shave is so damn good and the scent takes you back in time while keeping itself firmly in the present.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

There is hope that this amazing fragrance may eventually be offered to the public though. Catie’s Bubbles is on of the original artisans to gain popularity and has been making wet shaving products since 2013. You can find their current offerings on their website, Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nEau De Thé is a green and black tea based scent with tops of aquatic notes and floral notes. Scent notes are listed as:  bergamot, ginger, green tea, black tea, aldehydes, orris root, aquatics, warm musks, woods, and  incense. The resulting fragrance is vibrant but delicate and really highlights the teas. This is one of the best tea scents I have come across to date. Mrs. Ruds approves of this fragrance for casual wears. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the container and remains this way for the entire shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Talbot Shaving Howick Hall as a comparable scent profile. \n\nCatie’s Bubbles luxury soap base is a stand out in all measurable areas. This vegan soap was the first to blur the lines between performance as it relates to the vegan v. tallow argument. The soap is of mid firmness and is easy to load. Listed ingredients: stearic acid, water, coconut oil, potassium hydroxide, shea butter, fragrance, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, sodium lactate, and glycerin. The soap base is of average thirst and when dialed in has a similar consistency to that of cool whip. The slickness and residual slickness are elite. The post shave is excellent and where the luxury soap base goes next level. Catie’s Bubble post shave bridges the gap between tallow based soaps and vegan soaps. The base leaves your skin moisturized and supple. The ShaveScore for this soap base is a 95. Comparable soap bases that I’d recommend are First Line Shave and Wholly Kaw (donkey milk) \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Catie’s Bubbles Eau De Thé (purchased)\n* Brush - ​Mocek \"Green Tea\" w/ 24mm Maggard SHD (purchased)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - Catie’s Bubbles Eau De Thé (purchased)",

([https://www.stirlingsoap.com/](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/)) is a veteran owned artisan founded in January, 2012 by owners, Roderick and Amanda Lovan. The company is focused on high quality offerings for budget friendly prices with regards to grooming and accouterments. They also focus on staying environmentally conscious with their product making processes. Stirling Soap Co.’s offerings can be purchased direct or at third party resellers like Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nSatsuma is a citrus forward scent which utilizes notes of mandarin and spices to create a sweet citrus smell with hints of oriental spice. The mandarin note is most dominant as intended, and it’s a realistic smell that is not overly sweet and not synthetic at all. The spices are subtle and add some depth to this simplistic accord. Because of its uncanny resemblance to the fruit, I consider this a casual wear. It is bright enough for the cold damp months and refreshing enough for the warmer months, therefore it’s multi seasonal approved. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains this way once lathered. Similar scent from the hobby are: Eleven Organic Sweet Orange and Maggard Razors Orange Menthol.\n\nStirling Soap Co. uses a tallow based soap featuring the following ingredients: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate. The soap base is in the middle of the firmness spectrum and loads with ease. The soap is thirsty and the lather created with proper hydration will be the consistency of Greek yogurt. Both primary and secondary slickness is very good, bordering on excellent level slickness. Post shave is very good, as can be expected based on the ingredients used in the process. Overall this soap base receives a ShaveScore of 88. Soap bases with a similar performance are Bufflehead Soap Co. and Summer Break Soaps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Stirling Soap Co.

There is just an overwhelming array of artisans on the scene, Noble Otter just hadn't made it to my radar.  Fortunately, a fellow wet shaver gave me a heads-up regarding this limited release, and I snagged a set.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the artisan acquiesced to a small faction of followers who were pining for a dupe of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb EdT.  While the quaint hand-drawn modification of their label intended for the unscented offering, \"Bare\", is charming, it's my understanding moves are being made to have more professional labels for future limited offerings.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, the container is a standard rigid ~~89~~ 100 mm Parkway polypropylene tub holding approximately 4 oz. of product topped with a matching threaded lid.  The satin-finish waterproof labels are straight and devoid of blemish or bubbles.  The art is crisp and the text is easy to read.  The overall design is both classy and whimsical, the focal point of which obviously being the austere otter.  In the regular offerings, the otter's attire is reportedly indicative of the respective fragrance.  Perhaps it's been done elsewhere, but this aspect is reminiscent of Zoologist's scheme.  My only critique would be that the actual Noble Otter brand name and stylized logo is small and somewhat difficult to feature in a SOTD photograph unless one employs a macro shot.  Of course, the understated text is probably by-design in keeping with the formal presentation.  The aftershave splash is the standard 4 oz. glass amber apothecary bottle with ribbed threaded black lid that was secured with a break-away safety seal.\n\nOff the tub, the scent strength is quite light, but it essentially doubles (I refuse to say \"explodes\") upon lathering, opening with a fresh spicy clean resin topped by a lemony citrus enveloped by a rounded floral that stops just short of rose.  The fragrance warms up with time revealing a leathery tobacco with wisps of cinnamon, never becoming heavy.  The paired splash presents similarly, but certainly sharper bergamot in the opening.  The spiciness is more distinct in the splash, and this phase obviously lasts longer before warming up.  The leather and tobacco, while still present in the splash's dry down aren't as easily separated suggesting a skilled blending.  After about three hours, I begin to lose the fragrance just as the cinnamon steps in.  There is also a final smoky sweetness in the vanilla realm.  I think I went nose blind at the four-hour mark because I could no longer detect it, but my wife did. \n\nI have no experience with target fragrance, so I can't speak to the accuracy.  I did, however find it to be pleasant enough that I'm entertaining the thought of picking up a bottle of the Spicebomb EdT or the \"Extreme\" variant EdP.  My limited research suggests the two versions do differ in more than strength, so if someone can tell me which fragrance more closely matches Kaboom!, I'd appreciate it.\n\nIn terms of performance, if not for the thirst, this beef tallow base could pass for a Talbot shaving creation, loading and lathering in a very similar nature.  Noble Otter functions with moderate hydration, yielding a voluminous thick lather similar to high-butter vegan bases like that of PAA's Crown King base.  However, if you stop here, there is a bit of spackling which is a good indicator that more water will optimize it.  Prior to the shave, test palm lathers proved this base can handle a fair bit of water thereby achieving elite levels of slickness, so I proceeded to push the water for the head and face lathering.  Slickness is competitive with any soap I've tried.  Residual slickness takes that up a notch more such that long sweeping scalp passes were easily obtained on residual slickness alone.  Being a shower shaver, I'm less concerned with where the lather falls, but with this kind of slickness, my carelessness made the all metal Schick injector a little precarious to hold on to.  This is incredible slickness despite my hard water.\n\nThe post shave is also similar to Talbot's and Catie's Bubbles' jojoba bases.  That is to say, the post shave is spectacular, requiring no post-product whatsoever. Thus the splash was simply about continuing the experience.  I was surprised with how the splash was distributed.  Using only a couple in my palm to spread on my dome and face, my hand glided as if the splash were mostly oil.  I anticipated at least some degree of greasiness, but instead, it soaked right in leaving a silky smooth, natural feel.  I searched the ingredients for something like glycerin, but it's not there.  This surprising slickness could be attributed to reconstitution of the soap base, but I thoroughly rinse in the shower and towel dry before I apply aftershave, so I fine that to be unlikely.\n\nUltimately, this was a perfect shave both in terms of enjoyable fragrance and high-level performance.\n\n*DISCLOSURE:  I purchased the aforementioned products for retail price directly from the artisan's web site.  I received no gifts or other incentives in return for my comments.*\n\nSOAP INGREDIENTS: stearic acid, beef tallow, coconut milk, aloe vera, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, castor oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, lanolin, tucuma seed butter, kokum butter, sodium hydroxide, bentonite clay, tocopheral acetate, citric acid, watermelon extract, whitewillow bark extract, tussah silk.*\n\nAFTERSHAVE INGREDIENTS:  denatured alcohol, witch hazel, water, sodium lactate, panthenol, carrot extract, chamomile extract, seaweed extract.*\n\n*Fragrance is an assumed ingredient. As previously stated, the labels are from the \"Bare\" unscented variety and have been modified by hand to accommodate this limited fragrance.\n\nBONUS PIC:  https://i.imgur.com/cMRQNYR.jpg",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 23rd installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Van Yulay Spicy Man](https://i.imgur.com/5wieHPf.jpg)\n\nVan Yulay Spicy Man is a... OK, I just need to stop right here and say this name is just the worst. I usually save the branding/packaging stuff until the end of these openers but, honestly, all I can think of when typing Spicy Man is some guy in a silk shirt unbuttoned too low with chest hair overflowing asking \"How you doin'?\" while giving [the Buddy Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Christ). I don't want to be a Spicy Man. I'm not one of [two wild and crazy guys](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=487208695287987). The weird, outer-spacey design on the label doesn't help nor does the discordant font that Spicy Man is written in. The ~~soap~~ croap does come in the tub squeezed out into kind of florets as if it was put in there by a cake icing tube so it does have that going for it.\n\nAnyway, onto the actual store itself. Van Yulay (I have no idea what it means) is a weird store that's been around since 1999, which is a long time in the soap world, though they started out, it appears, with bar soaps. That bar soaping expanded further to where it has become quite the broad spectrum of skin care products and other... things. You can buy not just shaving soap, bar soap, and other shave stuff but things ranging from soap molds to nipple cream to emu feathers... in case you need emu feathers. They have somewhat of a decent following in the wet shaving world and, looking at search, get used every so often around here. They also have every damn scent imaginable available, most of which are probably not built/designed/created (whatever term you use for making a scent) by Van Yulay but still, it's a lot.\n\nSpicy Man is, obviously, their Old Spice dupe and I'm guessing not a scent built by her as the listed scents from the profile are copied word for word from Fragnetica's page. Accompanied by the copy-paste is \"Enjoyed for all generations. A perfect blended cologne scent.\", which, yea, is true, but doesn't really reflect an understanding of the scent. Then again, half these dupes' descriptions just say something along the lines of grandpas and classic with little unpacking of the actual scent.\n\nAnd now for your convenience the scent notes copied from Van Yulay, which were copied from Fragnatica: top notes are Nutmeg, Star Anise, Aldehydes, Orange and Lemon; middle notes are Cinnamon, Carnation, Pimento, Geranium, Heliotrope and Jasmine; base notes are Benzoin, Vanilla, Musk, Tonka Bean, Cedar and Ambergris.\n\nI put a lot of effort into copying and pasting that so I hope you're all grateful.\n\nAs indicated by the strikeout in the first paragraph, Van Yulay makes Spicy Man as a croap, not a soap, arguing it isn't a hard puck but also isn't a soft cream. That's fair as it is definitely on the softer side, though I think it's more semantics than anything else as I've had plenty of \"soaps\" this soft as well. The ingredient list has one unique characteristic: emu oil. Van Yulay says that emu oil has 2-4 times the penetration ability of normal oils so it's super moisturizing. I don't know how this study was conducted but I hope not too many emus were hurt in the process.\n\nThe rest of the ingredients list is stuff you'll find in a variety of soaps, including tallow and some clays: Stearic Acid, Coconut Fatty Acid, Palm Stearic, Castor, Glycerin, Potassium & Sodium Hydroxide, Aloe Vera, Coconut-Tallow-Lanolin-Babassu-Manteca-Argan-Emu Oils- Shea & Kokum-Butters, Sodium Lactate, Calendula, Extracts, Poly Quats, Allantoin, Silica, Bentonite & Kaolin Clay, and Fragrance.\n\n**Oldness: 2**\n\nI'm not quite sure whoever designed this scent ever actually smelled original Old Spice in any way except in passing. Like maybe someone described Old Spice to a person vaguely and then that person taught a moose very basic English and then told that moose the scent profile and then the moose tried to make the scent but realized it didn't have opposable thumbs but went ahead anyway. While the mid and bottom notes are kind of there the citrus and spice top notes are completely gone, replaced by a kind of chocolatey baking scent. Maybe some of the sweeter base notes like vanilla and Tonka are too strong and giving me that scent but whatever it is the overall effect is something only slightly akin to Old Spice.\n\n**Spiciness: 1**\n\nThis scent is just entirely off for me. While I would instantly tell you it is Old Spice adjacent nothing about it really works, including how incredibly weak the scent is overall. The scent never changes during the shave and doesn't get any more interesting. Maybe if Van Yulay said this was a riff I'd be slightly more inclined to enjoy it but their claim is definitely a direct dupe and it couldn't be any more removed from that.\n\n**Lather: 2**\n\nSpicy Man can eventually kick up a really nice-looking lather that's pretty thick if a little on the airy side, but getting it to that point is a pain. All three of my shaves required far more soap than I usually need. You'd definitely tear through this tub really quickly using it regularly from the amount you need to use to get a decent lather. It's also pretty tough to dial in, especially for a croap. I never felt like I was getting it to the spot I wanted, partially because I kept needing to put more soap in.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nYou know what's a great part of shaving with a specific scent? Actually smelling that scent while you're shaving. I mean, it would be hard to justify buying the same soap in 20 different scents if you couldn't really smell it while shaving, right? Unfortunately, Spicy Man's scent drops down to nearly zero upon lathering so that as you're shaving it's almost imperceptible and your nose goes nose blind almost instantly. While the shave itself is actually pretty good once dialed in, with one of the softest face feels of any soap (power to the emu) and a great cushion and a nice dose of slickness, the fact that its scent is so incredibly weak once lathered drags it down.\n\n**Post: 2**\n\nLook, soap scent for most soaps doesn't hang around all that long and it's not meant to. That's why, if you're not me and only use Old Spice, you buy a bunch of aftershave and other splashes. However, having no scent at all stick around is big problem. It's not that the scent is weak (I've had plenty of lighter scent soaps), it's that it's like it was never there at all. I was also a little disappointed the emu oil did increase my face's moisturization by 2-4 times either. It's definitely on the more moisturizing side in post but let us say 1.5 times. Van Yulay's highly scientific emu oil research was clearly off.\n\n**Overall: 10**\n\nVan Yulay Spicy Man isn't a bad shave soap as this score might reflect but it's a terrible Old Sice dupe, especially since you can't really smell its flawed dupe scent anyway. While the lather might take some work and use a chunk of soap and the shave may be decent the fact that the scent is so off to start and then completely gone by the end means it's hardly an Old Spice dupe at all. I hate being harsh with a base that's actually perfectly acceptable but every time I shaved with it and lost the scent [this is all I could think about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yptXkLglKkA).\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

Lauren, the owner and man behind the soap making is an avid reader. Reading provides a respite from the stresses of life and his hope is that Storybook Soapworks hand crafted soaps and post shave products will do the same for its users. It has been quite some time since I have used a Storybook Soapworks product. This particular offering is a part of a trilogy created by various artisans for the Reddit sub, r/wetshaving. The scent was designed by the famed fragrance house, Chatillon Lux ([https://chatillonlux.com/](https://chatillonlux.com/)). Storybook Soapworks can be purchased direct from their website or at  Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nWest Egg named for the city of the newly-rich from the Great Gatsby, is a whimsical scent featuring scent notes of: white grapes and sparkling aldehydes. The culmination of these notes represents the smell of champagne. To my nose, this is an accurate recreation of the bubbly drink that signifies celebration. The scent is vibrant and fun, it is approachable and feels almost unisex for use. Mrs. Ruds likes the scent. While she does not find it sexy or masculine, she approves of casual ring. Strength of scent is mid out of the soap tub and remains this way once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends the Chatillon Lux eau de parfum as a complimentary scent profile.\n\nStorybook Soapworks uses a tallow based soap featuring listed ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Fragrance, Shea Butter, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Bran Oil, Avocado Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol. The soap is soft and therefore care should be taken to ensure it is not overloaded. The soap is of above average thirst, but not the thirstiest soap out there. When properly hydrated and dialed in, the resulting lather will display the consistency of sour cream. Both primary and residual slickness are very good. While short of the upper tier soaps in terms of slickness, it gets the job done without any problems. Post shave is protective and nourishing to the skin. The post shave, like the slickness is very good. Storybook Soapworks soap base is more than a serviceable base in terms of performance and as such receives a ShaveScore of 88. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest: Purely Skinful Handmade Essentials and Stubble Buster.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Storybook Soapworks West Egg (loaner)\n* Brush - DS Cosmetics “Gel Tip” (promotional gift)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Chatillon Lux West Egg (loaner)",

I was using these for the first time, and I was expecting to get tanned, even though I applied it regularly. I was a bit surprised that it saved me from tanning.\n\nI didn't feel any cooling sensation as such, but it did the job of protecting against tanning, no white cast and didn't even pill.

Can't say the same for this sunscreen. \n\nIt's not sweat proof or water proof, and can burn your eyes if you accidentally rub them before the product seeps into your skin. I wouldn't recommend it for oily skin too, as it feels greasy.\n\nThe product does its job of protecting against sun, but I haven't been out for longer hours after applying it. Plus, reapplying it while being out under the sun might lead to pilling. The positives are that it has no white cast, is affordable and might work for dry skin.\n\n**Repurchase:** No\n\n\n",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/WgZ0Na3WnBU)\n\nAriana & Evans ([https://shavingshopclub.com/](https://shavingshopclub.com/)) is releasing their newest soap base reformulation imminently. Ariana & Evans was my 2019 Artisan of the Year and continues to remain at the top of the artisan market in both popularity, software performance and scent popularity. Ariana & Evans is available at these third party retailers; Maggard Razors (www.maggardrazors.com), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/), Smallflower (https://www.smallflower.com/), Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/) and TVB Shaving (https://tvbshaving.com/).​ \n\nKaizen is a bright weather scent featuring notes of: mandarin, bergamot, lemon peel, green apple, rose honeysuckle, sandalwood, cedar, Haitian vetiver, tobacco absolute and cinnamon leaf. This scent opens sweet and citrusy with a hint of spice. An added creaminess becomes present mid journey before the earth tones balance this fragrance out. To me this is a Colonia style scent, in the vein of Aqua di Parma, but with a bold twist in typical Ariana & Evans fashion. I suspect this scent will appeal to the masses.Mrs. Ruds approves of this scent for casual use. Strength of scent is strong off the puck and remains strong when lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Fine Accoutrements - Italian Citrus as a similar scent profile.  \n\nKaizen, also the name of the new soap base from Ariana & Evans aims to improve upon the already elite level performance customers have come to enjoy. Ingredients are listed as: Stearic, Tallow, Aqua, Goats Milk, Kokum Butter, Shea Butter, Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Glycerin, Manteca, Aloe Juice, Avocado Oil, Agave, Hemp Seed Oil, Apricot Kernel Seed Oil, Lanolin, Slippery Elm, Sodium Lactate, Xanthan Gum, Silk Amino Acid, Tussah Silk and Marshmallow Root. This is a mid-firm soap base that is of extreme thirst but is a mindlessly easy lathering soap. Water is your friend when dialing in this lather. The resulting lather will have the consistency of marshmallow fluff. Slickness is amazing, so slick that rinsing your hands is required before grabbing your shave tool of choice. Elite in class in terms of slickness may not do it justice. The post shave brings an already best in class post shave to another level. It literally feels like a high end moisturizer was applied to your skin after you rinse the lather away. Ariana & Evans previous base was damn near perfect, but somehow Kaizen eclipses it in noticeable fashion. Ariana & Evans receives a ShaveScore of 101.

Thanks to everyone who placed orders with us; the response was far greater than we had initially anticipated. **Just a Reminder: These orders will not ship immediately, but will definitely ship before April 18th**\n\nHere’s how the label contest will proceed:\n\n1) From today until noon EST on Monday, March 14th, we will be accepting submissions for soap and aftershave labels. After that time, they will be put up for a vote and the winner will receive a free jar of soap and bottle of either Kyovu or Tonique aftershave (winner’s choice).\n\n2) Please email the designs directly to us at barristerandmann@gmail.com\n\n3) **Because the soap and aftershave are not being wholesaled, these labels do not require a UPC, so it's best if you omit any space for one.**\n\n4) We need both a soap and a Tonique (alcohol) aftershave label. The dimensions are as follows:\n\nThe soap label should be a **circle 3.875 inches (9.842 centimeters) in diameter**. *If you wish for us to create a double-sided label like we did for Night Music, please indicate that and submit both sides.** If we only receive one side, we will assume that the label is meant to be single-sided. **The fill weight for the soap is 4 oz**\n\nThe aftershave label should be a **rectangle 2.25 inches (5.715 centimeters) tall by 5.25 inches (13.335 centimeters) wide.

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 20th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Cooper & French Old Goat](https://i.imgur.com/LFSB4NR.jpg)\n\nIn my initial searches for Old Spice dupes Cooper & French Old Goat came up quickly and repeatedly. While not one of the top recommended ones by Wet Shavers (though it was recommended) the soap did come up easily on Google searches and in online stores, which is saying something given half the soaps I find take incredible amounts of Google sleuthing or come from someone directly linking them. What I'm trying to say is that C&P had been sitting on my radar since the beginning but I just hadn't jumped onto it. Then Maggards had a sale that was too good to pass up and I finally ordered a puck. Not that at $21.99 a puck it's an especially expensive soap but why pass up a good sale... especially when you're buying *a lot* of Old Spice soap.\n\nC&P is a husband and wife pair from the great city of Minneapolis, MN, where they started their company in a quest to find a good shaving product. Founded in 2017, they spent a few years before that messing around as hobbyist before taking the leap into actually selling their soap. It's the classic soapmaker story of boy meets DE razor, boy starts making soap, boy and girl launch shaving soap company. No, really. That's the story behind, like, every soapmaker, plus or minus a boy/girl. Anyway, now they make soap we can shave our faces with.\n\nOld Goat is described as a scent they developed to \"pay homage\" to Old Spice, which seems to mean they're going for direct duplication here. It is a bit confusing, however, as their scent profile for the soap calls it a mix of vanilla and bourbon on their page, mentioning elsewhere citrus notes as well. Now, bourbon and Old Spice do share some of the same scent profile -- including vanilla and especially in the base scents -- but I wouldn't in a million years call Old Spice a bourbon scent or even something that plays with bourbon scent. Obviously, vanilla is a part of the Old Spice scent profile and the top notes are all citrus, but describing your Old Spice dupe as vanilla and bourbon is pretty odd unless you're going for a bourbon riff on the scent. It's a very weird description.\n\nThere's also some confusion in the ingredients for the soap as well! Old Goat doesn't use the same base as the rest of C&P's shave soap line. As the name suggests (along with the big red label on the container) this version of their base uses goat milk (one of my favorite soap ingredients) in place of the water that's usually in the soap. Or maybe as part of. Or maybe in a very small amount? I've found three versions of the ingredients in this base. While C&P 's website lists the ingredients as containing no water, the side of the tub lists water as the very first ingredient with goat milk missing, and, finally, TTS lists water as the first ingredient and goat milk second. I'm going to discard the tub label as I'm guessing it's just their normal base ingredients unchanged for Old Goat labels (I also don't have it with me at the moment so I may just have missed the goat milk ingredient in the list and can't double check). TTS's description may not have been put in by the soapmakers themselves so I won't use that either. \n\nThus, for the purposes of this review, the ingredients in the soap are: Goat Milk, Potassium Stearate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Glycerin, Fragrance, Sodium Lactate. Yup, a goat milk *and* tallow base! I don't think I've had one with both, so definitely an interesting combination. \n\nI really dig the labeling on this one. There's something classic about the C&F font in their logo and I love the way it looks over the old ship. Just kind of looks classic all around, though maybe a bit overcrowded in terms of design. Also, the bright red \"Made with Goat Milk\" makes me feel like I'm buying something being sold on an infomercial (\"Did you say goats milk, Steve?\" \"Yes, Mary. I did! Can you believe that the milk of a goat can do all this!\").\n\n**Oldness: 4**\n\nI don't think any other word than classic could possibly be used to describe this take on Old Spice. Despite the odd scent description mentioned above this flat out smells like classic Old Spice. Despite the vanilla being mentioned prominently, I wouldn't say it stands out and there's absolutely no bourbon to it. C&F have found a nearly perfect balance that hits the kind of muted Old Spice scent wonderfully. The only reason I wouldn't say it's perfect is because the citrus is a bit stronger than I think of in OG Old Spice. Only a small bit, though, far different from the last few soaps I've been shaving with where a specific aspect seems randomly pulled to the forefront. \n\n**Spiciness: 5**\n\nPardon the seeming non-sequiter, but I've reviewed a lot of things in my life (mostly movies and video games) and one thing I've learned is that there is no such thing as a non subjective review. Our experiences help define how we perceive things and our experiences are very based in the moment we are in. See, in looking back, I noticed that I'd been on a run of scents that seemed to want to play around or pull out a specific aspect of Old Spice and so in opening the tub of Old Goat and finding a scent that actually seemed to want to duplicate the wonderfully complex yet somewhat dull scent of Old Spice I was instantly excited. I'm not sure if I had reviewed this at another time it would get a 5 here (though still a higher score) but, thankfully, Spiciness is my entirely subjective section so I can simply say opening this puck and finding a fantastic, no frills dupe made my day.\n\n**Lather: 2** \n\nOld Goat's lather is easily the weakest part of what is a very strong soap. While it's not super challenging to get it to turn into a big lather, that lather is incredibly airy and light without some serious work. I never, in fact, got it to that wonderfully messy, shiny, slickness that I like to bring from the bowl to my face before finishing up the lather on the face. This just isn't a satisfying soap to lather.\n\n**Shave: 4**\n\nIt is, however, a satisfying soap to shave with. We've had a few soaps that don't lather all that well or pretty but provide a solid shave but this one really surprised me. While the soap seems thin it provides a good (but not great) cushion, even on more aggressive razors. The slickness, though, is beyond fantastic, with a glide I found almost perfect and a residual slickness that allowed for easy shaving throughout the experience. If I hadn't used a truly aggressive razor on one shave that need a bit more cushion this probably would have been a 5. \n\n**Post: 4**\n\nOld Goat left my face feeling great (thank you, goats milk) after every shave. I found it incredibly moisturizing and soft despite not being one of the more complex soap recipes. The scent also melded wonderfully with both the Indian Old Spice and the vintage one... at least when I could smell it. The soap's scent doesn't linger around all that long, unfortunately, getting lost mostly in the aftershave very quickly after it applied. I would have liked a bit more staying power, but I can't argue with how good my face felt for the day. \n\n**Final: 19**\n\nPart of this just might be the fact that I'd been on a rash of soaps that were off  on their duplication so landing on one that finally felt like it was actually in the realm of the OG just made me really happy. But that shouldn't discount the fact that Cooper & French have a fantastic duplication scent (despite describing it horribly) that also provides a great shave. While the lather might be a bit challenging and lackluster, that's not really a worry when you get consistently great shaves out of it. \n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

This hobbyist artisan has spent a significant amount of time testing recipes and formulating the best base possible before releasing. On November 16, 2018 the first Mammoth Soap was sold on West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), with whom, the artisan has an exclusive distribution agreement with. Mammoth Soaps donates $1 per tub sold to fight human trafficking. Their current charity for this effort is Love146.org. This charity focuses on battling child trafficking.\n\nMammoth Soap’s first scent is called Hygge (pronounced hue-guh). Featuring notes of orange, bergamot, fir, juniper, amber, frankincense, musk, and castoreum, it is billed as a barbershop base with a wintery/christmas vibe. The scent is warming and certainly fits the intended theme. Notes of fir and juniper present most prominently and the faint smells of amber and musk add some animalic quality to the scent. The citrus is noticeable, but only slightly and complimentary. Strength of scent is light to mid both off the container and remains this way once lathered. Scent in a similar vein are: Noble Otter The Trail and Tallow + Steel Rainforest.\n\nMammoth Soap utilizes a tallow and duck fat soap base. The ingredients are listed as: stearic acid, water, beef tallow, duck fat, kokum butter, glycerin, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, murumuru butter, argan oil, lanolin, sodium lactate, tocopherol. The soap is of mid firmness and load very easily into your brush. The base can take a lot of water but doesn’t demand anymore than would be expected from an animal fat based soap. The lather structure is much like cool whip when dialed in. It has high volume and average density to it. The slickness stands with many good animal fat soaps both in terms of primary and secondary slickness. Post shave is luxurious and is the star of this base. Given the overall performance of this soap base, Mammoth Soaps receives a shavescore of 89. Soaps with similar performance are Chiseled Face and Mickey Lee Soapworks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Mammoth Soap Hygge (gift)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers “Raptor” (purchased)\n* Razor - Jerry Stark #502 (loaner)\n* Post - Mammoth Soap Hygge (gift) ",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 23rd installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Pinnacle Grooming The Good Ship OS](https://i.imgur.com/pHSGMkg.jpg)\n\nPinnacle Grooming is a UK-based soapmaker with a pretty solid following around the wetshaving community. I couldn't find exactly when they launched but their Facebook page says it was created in October of 2019 and since we all know social media is nothing but a bastion of truth I'm going to say it was around then. They say their ingredients are ethically and sustainably sourced but it's a little hard to trust them on the whole for reasons we'll dive into in a few paragraphs. (That's called a teaser, now you have to keep reading to find out THE SHOCKING TRUTH).\n\nThe Good Ship OS was a late addition to the series despite launching in 2021, well before I began digging around for Old Spice dupes. That may be because, from what I've seen, Pinnacle Grooming released this soap on a limited release, meaning once it was gone it was gone and it appears that The Good Ship OS is gone (outside of The Razor Company's stock, which is where I picked the soap up). This actually seems to be something they do often as their site notes, in some awkwardly written English, that they release limited editions of scents in order to cater to their cutomer's needs. Those scents seem to range from the weird (nutmeg/green appple/rose) to their \"take\" on already established scents.\n\n\"Take\" is, of course, a controversial word in the land of duping and there's no clear statement from them on if they're just using dupe scents they've bought or actually building their own but most soapmakers aren't very clear on that anyway. I think this is meant to be a straight dupe but they do list two scent notes that don't always appear in descriptions of Old Spice: Clary Sage and Frankincense. So in the top layer you have the addition of Clary Sage alongside the more normally listed notes of Orange, Lemon, Spices, Anise, and Aldehydes. The middle notes are all the same with Cinnamon, Carnation, Geranium, Jasmine, Heliotrope, and Pimento berry. Then the base notes add in Frankincense to accompany the traditional Vanilla, Musk, Cedarwood, Benzoin, Tonka, and Ambergris.\n\nThe base is a bit of a hodgepodge of stuff you find in shaving soaps, with a wide variety of oils, butters, and other soapy things tossed in. It honestly reads like the creation of a child in their dad's soapmaking lab who just pores everything into the pot and lucks out with creating a soap: Beef Tallow. Potassium Stearate. Mango Butter. Distilled Water. Avocado Oil. Castor Oil. Goats Milk. Olive Oil. Aloe Vera Juice. Kokum Butter. Vegetable Glycerine. Almond Oil. Shea Butter. Silk Amino Acid. Coconut Oil. Lanolin. Grape Seed Extract. Bentonite Clay. Cocoa Butter. Camellia Oil. Sodium Lactate. Vitamin E Pure. mica pigment s (CI77019, CI77891, CI77288) Fragrance & Essential Oils. Gotta give props as always for goats milk, though. The soap itself is on the harder side and a darker color, heading into dark brown territory.\n\nOn a side note, Pinnacle Grooming did something pretty awesome with this soap. For every purchase £2.00 was donated to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which seems to be the British equivalent of the the U.S. Coast Guard... or maybe the Coast Guard is the U.S. equivalent of the RNLI. Anyway, it seems like a good cause and they even posted a picture of the donations being sent to their Facebook page.\n\nSadly, no matter how good this review is or isn't and no matter where some of the proceeds go, I can't recommend buying from Pinnacle as they appear to be thieves. I thought at first that Pinnacle Grooming had some of the coolest artwork around with a variety of unique images, unfortunatley that seems to be because they've stolen most of it. I ran about 10 searches on random artwork on their tubs and every single one of them came from either an artist's website, a literal official piece of character artwork, or one of those t-shirt design sites. This extends to The Good Ship OS artwork, which appears to be [taken from an artist named Ian Gowdie](https://digitalkangaroo.co.uk/product/lifeboat-print/). The piece itself is a fantastic rendition of what I assume to be an RNLI lifeboat cutting through a brisk sea, supposedly on its way to save someone's life while smelling really fucking good. I bet whomever it saves will instantly say something like, \"Thank you for saving me, and damn you smell good.\" But despite being perfect for an Old Spice soap container, it's not theirs to use. They don't credit any of the artists anywhere on their page that I can see nor do they mention it on the tub so even if they did pay for a digital copy of *every* piece of art on a tub it's still pretty shitty and a total bummer.\n\n**Caveat:** I would be happy, by the way, to be proven wrong about that and discover that they are paying the artists for their art but it seems unlikely. And now I've spent two hours doing research on a shaving soap company and the images on some fucking tubs, basically ruining my desire for the soap itself so... now I'm just grumpy. Let's get on with the review (which was actually written first and not influenced by any of the above).\n\n**Oldness: 3**\n\nWhile they may be aiming for a dupe, Pinnacle Grooming should really market this as a riff. They aren't veering far off from the original but the scent feels different. Off the puck, the soap is especially strong in the anise with the citrus playing hard in there as well. That settles down on the shave with the on-point middle notes and base coming through stronger but it still isn't a traditional Old Spice scent. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely an Old Spice scent but there's something a bit fresher and more modern to it. Maybe it's the Clary Sage but I couldn't tell you what that actually smells like or who this suspicious Clary person is and why he's got special sage.\n\n**Spiciness: 5**\n\nHonestly, I love this scent. It feels fresh and modern for some reason and at some point I'm going to have to buy some U.S. Old Spice to see if it maybe matches closer to that. Part of this is, of course, the fact that it's just something different enough from the OG scent I'm using all the time to stand out but it's also really great to smell. There's something incredibly refreshing about Good Ship OS that makes it actually fit with the sea-faring theme of Old Spice -- like a brisk breeze on the ocean air. It's not aquatic but it feels like something you would wear while on a boat, going fast,  wearing a nautical-themed pashmina afghan.\n\n**Lather: 2**\n\nPinnacle's Base builds up easily enough for sure but what it builds into is kind of lackluster. The lather is kind of airy no matter how long you work it. It's not so bad that it looks broken or overly thin but it never heats that glorious zone where the lather turns into a slick, fluffy mess. It's also super thirsty, which isn't always a bad thing but does mean that it can be tricky to dial in if you're not patient, which we all know is a strong suit of people shaving their faces at 6 a.m.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nSometimes an airy lather can still deliver a great shave, which is one of the reasons that I separate shave and lather. The Good Ship OS kind of does. In fact, the shave is all sorts of \"kind of.\" It's got kind of good cushion, and kind of good slickness, and kind of good face feel. Nothing stands out especially about it but it's definitely not delivering a bad shave either, plus it helps that the scent is so good. I will say that it doesn't do much in the residual slickness department but, again, it's not terrible.\n\n**Post: 2**\n\nGood Ship doesn't do anything to special on the face despite the presence of goat milk (and a bajillion other face-softening ingredients)! I'm not sure how that's possible but maybe they're getting their milk from lackluster goats. You know, the shady kind that eat the wrong kind of grass. Anyway, it's a perfectly fine post-shave feel but now we come to the real rub. This more \"modern/brisk\" verson of Old Spice doesn't play so well with the classic scent of the aftershaves. It's OK with the Indian version, where the elevated anise and crisper scents mingle fine, but put it with the vintage one and it goes together about as well as stolen art and a moral compass. (OK, that last sentence was edited post research it originally said \"a fish and a bicycle.\") While its score could easily be improved by one by just not using an aftershave that doesn't work with its scent, the point here is to use Old Spice as much as possible so I had to ding it.\n\n**Final Verdict: 15**\n\nWhy, oh, why is this fantastic scent stuck in this middling soap (and attached to a crummy company). The Good Ship OS delivers one of my favorite takes on Old Spice but can't manage anything else great and has a shave that is simply on par. The soap is a cut above the truly terrible ones, easily, but it can't deliver anything special either. Maybe, outside of the confines of this review system, I'd like it more but within the bounds of The Great Spice Off it mostly misses the mark.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

Erik and Fran have toughted the release as year five of this but with a twist. This year, the project uses an oak barrel aging process to impart “ghost notes” into the fragrance blend. PAA offerings can be purchased directly on the artisan’s website.   \n\nBlue Samhain is a fall inspired scent that features notes of: Sandalwood, Burnt Sugar, Bourbon and Pumpkin. The fragrance is matured in an oak barrel. The resulting fragrance is a sugary sweet accord with hints of sweet pumpkin and creamy sandalwood. The sugar note is most dominant and opens the accord with a cloyingly sweet blast. The pumpkin and sandalwood slightly temper the sweetness, but it is present for the entire scent journey. This actually smells like a pumpkin cookie to my nose. Mrs. Ruds does no approves of this scent, even casually. She finds it far too sweet for her taste. Strength of scent is strong off the container and for the entire shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Mike's Natural Soaps Sweet Pumpkin Spice as a comparable scent profile.      \n\nThe new base is known as CK-6 in the wet shaving community and according to the website features the addition of Bacuri Butter, Cupuacu Butter and Murumuru Butter. Overall the ingredients are listed as: Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Potassium Kokumate, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Castorate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoa Butterate, Potassium Avocadoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Capuacu) Butter, Astrocaryum (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Platonia Insignis (Bacuri) Seed Butter, Parfum \\[Fragrance\\]. The soap is soft and care needs to be taken to not overload your brush because it is also insanely thirsty. The lather explodes with water and when properly dialed in resembles Cool Whip. Slickness is improved, both primary and residual aspects are noticeably better than the regular PAA soap base. Post shave also improves upon the regular PAA base. This soap delivers on it’s promise to bridge the tallow gap, much like Catie’s Bubbles, Wholly Kaw and Grooming Dept have previously done. Considering the improvements, the ShaveScore for the CK-6 soap base is a 92. Soaps with a similar overall performance are: Wholly Kaw vegan and Southern Witchcrafts. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Phoenix Artisan Blue Samhain (loaner)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers Scorpion (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Vector (promotional gift)\n* ​Post - Phoenix Artisan Blue Samhain (loaner)",

    "body": "Barrister &amp; Mann is the brainchild of William Carius (/u/BostonPhotoTourist) who began his company in March 2013. The soaps quickly became the quintessential product to own in order to get a luxurious and classy shave. Will, is devoted to producing soap of the highest quality and that is proudly hand made in the United States. This includes the sourcing of his ingredients. Barrister &amp; Mann offers soap, alcohol based aftershave toniques and non alcohol based aftershaves (Kyovu). The site has a dedicated area for lady wet shavers and also has a budget line of soaps, dubbed Latha. Latha is a budget offering from Barrister &amp; Mann which by no means speaks to the quality of this soap line. Barrister &amp; Mann can be purchased directly from their [website](http://www.barristerandmann.com/) or from other third party resellers such as [Shave Revolution](http://www.shaverevolution.com/collections/shaving-soap/barrister-mann) or [Maggard Razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/soaps-creams/barrister-mann/).  \nAs always, I will provide my complete honest review and I have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review. This is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions. Most importantly, these are my opinions and mine alone. If you do not like them or disagree with them, I respect that and ask that you do the same.  \nPlease note that I often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time, the introduction, packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked. The uniqueness normally will be found in scent, price and overall.  \n**Packaging:**\nLatha Le Petit Chypre (LPC) comes in a slightly smaller jar than the traditional B&amp;M soap line, but it is still made of the same high quality polypropylene. The jar is translucent in color and features a screw top lid. The soap fills about three quarters of the jar, leaving ample room to load the soap directly from the jar. The label on the screw top is waterproof and simple. It features the soap name, company name, scent description and ingredients list.  \n**Lather:**\nLPC is a strong performer in the lathering category despite having a budget price point. With the soap bloomed, I am able to load the brush for 10-15 seconds and produce enough soap through a face lather for 3 or 4 full passes, not that it’s necessary. The Latha line hits all the metrics within the lathering domain, cushion, slickness, post pass/post shave are all better than average. If you had never tried the evolved soap bases like B&amp;M Glissant, MLS new soap base or Catie’s Bubble Luxury Cream, you would be more than happy with the lather performance of LPC and the Lahta line as a whole. \n**Scent:**\nThe scent on LPC is at heart a chypre, as the name indicates. For me, I do not get an evolving scent, I get a blended scent straight out of the gate and it remains the same to my nose throughout the lather and shave. This is not a bad thing by any stretch, just an observation and a slight variation from the norm, which would be the evolution of complex scents that I most often use. I am dancing on this because I struggle to really nail the scent down. Best I can so is that it’s like Aqua Velva went to a high end fragrance boutique for a make over and walked out with a new look and more high end complexity. The main scents of Oakmoss, Petirgan and Labdanum blend together to make a very crisp clean scent that really picks up one’s spirit.  \n**Price:**\nAt $11.00 for 4 oz of soap, this is soap comes in at $2.75/oz. This is where the soap stands out as one of the absolute very best bang for your buck. The ingredients list is clean: Aqua, Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Cocoate, Fragrance, Argania spinosa (Argan) Oil, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) Butter, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate, Tocopherol Acetate.  \n**Bottom Line:**\nToo often, price is perceived to be a reflection of quality in the soap world. LPC and the entire Latha line dispels that notion with its jack of all trades performance and a very high quality scent. I imagine most of the readers out there have tried Latha in one scent or another, given people’s desire to curb spending. That said, LPC is another strong offering from B&amp;M for those discerning folks who are looking to enjoy a good shave without breaking their bank.  \nHere is a [link](https://youtu.be/SMrfbT8Gt8w) to my initial impressions video of you care to partake.",

This drop supports the charity Love146.org, to which Mammoth Soaps donates $1 per tub sold to fight human trafficking, specifically, this charity focuses on battling child trafficking. Recognizing that this soap is pretty difficult to get your hands on, I am offering this soap up, unused except a small sample taken out for this review. This will be a silent auction style event. 100% of the proceeds raised will be directly donated to the Love146 charity. The auction begins as soon as this video is posted and will remain open until Sunday, February 3, 2019 at 12:00P ET. In order to enter, email me your highest bid. At the close of the auction the winner will be informed via return email. There will be no formal announcement unless the winning bidder asks to be made public. I will cover CONUS shipping and the first USD $10 for International.\n\nFunny Valentine is inspired by the lyrics from “My Funny Valentine”, written by Larry Hart. Scent notes for Funny Valentine are: strawberry, currant, rose, neroli, amber, cognac, and howood. The scent opens fruity and floral before a woodniess and some spice balance out the accord. This will be a polarizing scent because of the strength of the floral component in the opening. The scent is complex and in my opinion feels like a unisex offering. I would consider it a casual wear and it is definitely acceptable for multi-seasonal use. The scent strength is mid-strong off the container and remains there once lathered. In wet shaving, the following offerings share a similar vibe: Barrister and Mann Sinfonia and Grooming Dept Ambrosia.\n\nMammoth Soap utilizes a tallow and duck fat soap base. The ingredients are listed as: stearic acid, water, beef tallow, duck fat, kokum butter, glycerin, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, murumuru butter, argan oil, lanolin, sodium lactate, tocopherol. The soap is of mid firmness and load very easily into your brush. The base can take a lot of water but doesn’t demand anymore than would be expected from an animal fat based soap. The lather structure is much like cool whip when dialed in. It has high volume and average density to it. The slickness stands with many good animal fat soaps both in terms of primary and secondary slickness. Post shave is luxurious and is the star of this base. Given the overall performance of this soap base, Mammoth Soaps receives a ShaveScore of 89. Soaps with similar performance are Chiseled Face and Mickey Lee Soapworks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Mammoth Soap Funny Valentine (purchased)\n* Brush - WCS Red Jasper (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Best Quality” (gift)\n* Post - Geo F.

Whatever is very faint...\n\nAnd while these days I don't get the body wash because I want to avoid plastic where I can when I can, the body cream: **yes.** It has 10% of a complex that includes both lactic acid and urea, and on the inci I read it also has retinol:\n\n*Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum Mineral Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-100 Stearate, Dimethicone, Urea, Sodium Lactate, Lecithin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Zea Mays Oil, Calcium Pantothenate, Inositol, Retinol, Biotin, PEG-20 Castor Oil, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Alcohol Denat, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower ) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Parfum (Fragrance), Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Citronellol, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycine, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate*\n\nI have KP and this does help keep my skin smoother. Smells really nice too, kinda sweet powdery, but it doesn't linger. I hate HATE body creams and just that sensation of stickyness and this doesn't leave that.\n\nBest thing is the price point, I get this Amazon or Walmart for the equivalent of $4.11usd, the brand is Spanish, and for those of you in the US you can get it on Amazon for $10usd.

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/k_dOPTHgXgc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr. Jon's Shaving Soap Co. (https://www.drjonshandcraftedsoapco.com/) is an artisan soap maker based in Columbus Ohio. Jon and Kim, the owners have a passion for cruelty free, vegan soap making. Dr. Jon’s offers shaving soap, aftershave, cologne, pomade, razors and brushes. Dr. Jon’s has been hard a work and will be releasing their update base, V3 on June 3, 2019. Dr. Jon’s is available across the globe at a long list of stockists which can be seen here: https://www.drjonshandcraftedsoapco.com/apps/store-locator/.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFlowers in the Dark is a blend of lavender, coffin wood and ozone. The scent opens with a sharp punchy lavender before being met with the coffin wood and ozone. The scent is dark and almost chilling. This is a very well balanced scent. Each note has a role and plays it well. Mrs. Ruds approves of this scent, as lavender is one of the only floral accords she likes. Scent strength is mid-strong out of the tin and once lathered on the face. This scent is a nice alternative to straight lavender scents, although the lavender is a true star in this accord. Similar lavender forward scents that are available in the market are Crowne & Crane Lavender & Cedar and The Los Angeles Shaving Soap Company Woody Lavender.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDr. Jon’s is a vegan soap base. V3 lists the following ingredient: Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Mango Butter, Babassu Oil, Sodium Lactate, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Myristyl Myristate, Avocado Oil, Sunflower Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Meadowfoam Oil, Soy Wax, Cucumber Extract, Licorice Extract, Candelilla Extract, Sodium PCA, Sensolene, Squalane, Slippery Elm Bark, Aloe Vera Concentrate, Citric Acid.. The V3 base is on the firmer side of mid. It loads easily, a noticeable improvement from V2 in terms of loading and lather generation. Thirst remains the same between V2 and V3 in my experience. When dialed in, V3 will have a consistency similar to cool whip. Slickness is improved from V2 in both primary slickness and residual slickness. The slickness metric is very good overall. Post shave is also improved over V2, less so than slickness, but still noticeable. Overall V3 has an excellent post shave that really disguises the fact that it is a vegan soap base. I am impressed with the improvements from V2 to V3. It is apparent that Dr. Jon’s listened to customer feedback and improved where needed. The ShaveScore for Dr. Jon’s V3 is a 90. Soaps that perform in a similar manner are: Highland Springs Soap Co. and Oaken Lab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Dr. Jon’s Flowers in the Dark (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers Scorpion (purchased)\n* Razor - Worcester Razor Co. “Royal Worcester” (purchased)\n* Post - Talbot Shaving Mont Ventoux (gift)",

    "body": "I haven't done a stand alone review/first impression post in a while. Cutting Edge Soap is a new artisan out of Arizona, and I thought I'd post my first impression thoughts in addition to those of /u/Dendj55, who reviewed this soap a couple of weeks ago. I had mentioned to a friend that I was curious about this new company, and he generously offered to send me his set as a PIF. \n\nI've not been able to find out a lot of information about Cutting Edge Soap. They have a [website](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com), but not a lot of information about the artisan. The website does contain a section about how Cutting Edge Soap got started, which you can find [here](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/blog/background-info/).  The proprietor of Cutting Edge Soap credits Mo from Grooming Department, Tim at Mick's Grooming, and Ryan at Tallow & Steel for assistance and encouragement in developing his [product](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/blog/thank-you/).\n\nMaol Grooming is an established artisan from Canada, which is known for making excellent splashes. I don't know the story about how the two companies linked up for this endeavor, and I've not been able to find out any information in the brief few minutes of research I did. I would assume there is some connection between the two companies' owners, as it was a bit surprising to see an established artisan like Maol collaborate with a brand new soap company. \n\nThe soap appears to be no longer available on Cutting Edge Soap's website. You can view all eight of their current scent offerings [here](https://www.cuttingedgesoap.com/shaving-soap/). All of their regular offerings appear to be fairly basic scents like \"Evergreen & Cedar,\" \"Lemongrass & Lavender,\" and so forth. At $20 for a tub, the price seems fair.\n\nThe website lists the ingredients of the soap as follows: Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Castor Oil, Duck Tallow, Kokum Butter, Cocoa Butter, Mango Butter, Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Lanolin, Mirumiru Butter,  Gylcerin, Aloe Water, Xanthan Gum, Silk Peptides, Allentoin, Meadowfoam Oil, Vitamin E, Broccoli Seed Oil, Sucrose Cocoate, Punarnava, Silk Peptides, Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Lactate, Abyssinian Oil, Sunflower Lecithin, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Fragrance Stabilizer, Fragrance.\n\nThe soap is mid-firm, and has a bit of a orange/beige tint to it. I used a synthetic brush to load the soap, which is what I always do when testing new soaps, as I feel it's a bit more forgiving. I used a Pajeet-like method of starting with a fairly damp brush, loading fairly long, and adding water slowly to the puck. The lather on my brush during loading seemed quite foamy, and I was concerned. Foamy lather is usually bad news, but thankfully, the foam dissipated as I began to face lather.\n\nSoaps right now, especially elite level soaps, seem to be very thirsty. This soap, by contrast, was not very thirsty at all. I appreciated that it made it easy to get a nearly-dripping (lest I be trippin') lather built on my face very quickly. The lather was slick and dense, but did not have much of a sheen to it. I am not going to assign a score to it, but I will say that it fits very comfortably among high-quality soap bases currently available. All of the qualities one would look for in a soap base are certainly there, with slickness being very good, both primary and residual. \n\nThe scent is...interesting. The soap has a fairly light scent, and I actually enjoyed it more than I expected given my uncertainty smelling it from the puck.  Maol Grooming describes [Heliopteris](https://maolgrooming.com/product/heliopteris-aftershave/) as its take on a fougere, with \"hints of wood, earth, and spice. A very interesting and unique fragrance,\" having \"Egyptian Geranium, Egyptian Coriander, Marjoram, Cedarwood, Nutmeg, Patchouli, Atlas Cedarwood.\" It is interesting and unique. I went back and forth between thinking, yeah, I like this, and no, this isn't for me. I'm still not sure where I fall on the scent. I don't get a lot of sweetness, but instead I get more green notes, and a hint of bitterness, like the type of bitterness than comes from a grapefruit rind. Will I come back to this scent often? I don't know.  But, I'm a couple of hours post-shave, and I don't dislike it.  \n\nThis was my first time using a Maol aftershave. It has a very good reputation, and I would certainly agree that it's a fine product. It is a low alcohol splash, which is my favorite type. Drops of oil were visibly present in the splash upon splashing it into my palm, and that's a very good sign for me. I actually forgot to use a balm today in my rush out the door for work. Even though I forgot to use a balm, my face feels smooth and hydrated. That's probably the biggest compliment I can give.\n\nIn sum, Cutting Edge Soap's first offering fits nicely into the premium soap world. The slickness and lather quality is very good, and I enjoyed using the set today. Will I purchase more on my own? That remains to be seen. I'd like to see more interesting scent offerings, as basic Evergreen & Cedar type of scents aren't really something I want a lot of in my rotation. \n\nBrush: Dogwood Handcrafts Milkglass Timberwolf (purchased)\n\nRazor: Wolfman WR2 .95, WRH7 (purchased)\n\nBlade: Perma Sharp (purchased)\n\nSoap: Cutting Edge Soap/Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)\n\nSplash: Maol Grooming Heliopteris (PIF)",

Among the released scents was Forbidden Fruit. This offering completes the trifecta based around Khalifa, along with Chasing the Dragon. This will be available to the public in late May 2019. A&E offers a wide range of scents from ground up fragrance ideas, collaborations with fragrances houses and duplications of popular fragrances for men. Ariana & Evans is available at these third party retailers; Maggard Razors (www.maggardrazors.com), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/), Smallflower (https://www.smallflower.com/), Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/) and TVB Shaving (https://tvbshaving.com/).​\n\nForbidden Fruit consists of notes of: Apple Brandy, Jasmine, Rose, Anise, Resins, Hashish, Cannabis, Sandalwood, Oud and Cedarwood. This mysterious blend is the completion of the trifecta built around Khalifa and Chasing the Dragon. While Khalifa is dark and mysterious, Chasing the Dragon is sensual and foreboding and Forbidden Fruit is a friendly variation. The scent opens with the sweetness of the apple brandy before the resinous notes envelope the apple. The base is dark but smooth. Having a deep affinity for Khalifa, this variation is right up my alley. Mrs. Ruds approves of this scent and finds it appropriate for use for multiple occasions. Strength of scent is strong out of the container and remains this way throughout the entire shave. Similar scents from wet shaving are the aforementioned offerings from Ariana & Evans. \n\nAriana & Evans uses a tallow and goat milk based soap. Ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Shea Butter, Strangistó Giaoúrti, Potassium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Mango Butter, Cocoa Butter, Manteca (Lard), Glycerin, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Camellia Oil, Bentonite Clay, Beeswax, Sodium Lactate, Argan Oil, Fragrance & EO's.The soap remains on the firmer side of the spectrum and loads effortlessly into your brush fiber of choice and is a very thirsty soap. When dialed in, the lather resembles greek yogurt. The slickness is elite in both primary slickness and residual slickness. Post shave rises above all and provides the best post shave experience I have had to date. The resulting ShaveScore is a 96. Similarly performing soaps are Barrister and Mann and Talbot Shaving v2. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Ariana & Evans Forbidden Fruit (purchased)\n* Brush - ​Simpsons Chubby 2 Super Badger (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - Ariana & Evans Forbidden Fruit (purchased)",

This warm, spicy scent serves as an homage to the druid celebration of the Winter Solstice. The fragrance features notes of: Cedar, Oakmoss, Rosewood, Moss, Cypress, Tobacco, Mushroom, Sandalwood, Myrrh, Amber, Ginger, Orange. This accord is balance with an opening of earth tones, a heart of tobacco and mushroom and a finish of orange and spice. This is indeed a warm scent with a hint of spiciness. I like this scent quite a bit, although Mrs. Ruds is not a fan because of the earthy depth. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the container and remains that way once lathered. Scents with similarities from the wet shaving world are: LASSCo Bespoke #1 and Wholly Kaw King of Oud. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Druantia (loaner)\n* Brush - Lutin Brushworks (gift)\n* Razor - Nate’s Straights (loaner)\n* Post - Southern Witchcrafts Druantia (loaner)",

Mohammad, the proprietor and self proclaimed foodie and road cyclist, has continued to reformulate the soap base in order to provide the best possible wet shaving experience. In 2018, the brand received improved packaging and several variants of the popular vegan soap base, and animal fat soap base. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/).  \nCitric is a citrus forward fragrance. The scent notes are listed as: Bergamot, Petitgrain, Lemon, Lime, Kaffir Lime Leaf, Blood Orange, Sweet Orange, Angelica, Grapefruit, Black Pepper, Mandarin, Lavender, Castoreum, Pink Pepper, Benzoin, Nepalese Citronella, Litsea Cubeba, Ginger, Clove, Cinnamon Bark, Oakmoss Absolute, Coumarin, Jasmine Absolute, Geranium, Ylang Ylang. Violet, Leaf Absolute, Fir Balsam Absolute, Elemi, Vetiver and Amyris. Make no mistake, this is much more complex than just the litany of citrus notes. The scent is punchy with bitter, sharp citrus notes initially but is quickly subdued by spice, smokiness and earth. This bold scent will be polarizing based on individual scent perceptions. This is a casual wear because of its polarizing nature but it is also multi seasonal due to its complexity. Scent strength is mid strong off the container and stays this way once the lather is built. Similarities in wet shaving are: Crowne & Crane Citrus Melange and Catie's Bubbles Maggard Meetup 2017.\n\nGrooming Dept’s “janus tallow” formula is utilized for this soap. The base explores multiple animal fats (beef and lamb tallow) according to the artisans formula page (https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas). The ingredient list is as follows: Aloe Vera Juice, Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goat Milk, Castor Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Lamb Tallow, Camelina Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance\\*, Marshmallow Extract, Glycerine, Sunflower Lecithin, Grape Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Mango Butter, Coconut Oil, Larch Arabinogalactan, Glucomannan (Konjac root), Silk Peptides, Kaolin Clay, Allantoin, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate, Grape Seed Extract, Chamomile Extract, Green Tea Extract and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap is on the firmer side of the spectrum but loads with little effort into your brush fibers. This soap is very thirsty, among the thirstiest soaps I’ve used much like the previously review “primus tallow” formula. When dial in, the lather is a mid structure lather with the consistency of sour cream. Slickness stands with the elite class soap bases with regards to both primary and secondary slickness, although I find the “primus tallow” slightly slicker. The post shave also takes its place among the standout elites, better than the “primus tallow”. Given the overall experience with this luxurious soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 96. Similar performing soaps are Declaration Icarus and Arianna & Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Citric (gift)\n* Brush - Elite Razors Disco Taylor (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Razors Vector (promotional gift)\n* Post - Stirling Soap Co.

The fragrance is a blend of balsam, wet stone, exotic musk and black tea. The scent opens with a wonderful dark black tea smell. The musk notes and wet stone compliment the earthy dark tea so nicely. The balsam adds depth and continues the earth-centric vibe. While billed as a winter seasonal, I can see this fragrance being used year round. Mrs. Ruds enjoys this scent for casual wearing.

Their goal is to help bring to market affordable vegan shave products, as well as interesting scents.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Scent\n*A tribute to the druid celebration of the Winter Solstice or “Yule”, Druantia is woodsy and spicy scent perfect for crisp Winter days.*\n\n\nSo Druantia smells similar to that of a snicker-doodle followed up by some earthiness. Its an interesting combination and one I haven't smelled in the wetshaving game. I would rank the scent strength probably mid-strong to mid. I paired Druantia with Santal Auster due to sandalwood within both and I felt like they worked very well together. I defeinetly enjoy this scent and will be picking up the EdP and possibly the matching aftershave.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Performance\n**Ingredients:** *Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay, fragrance*\n\n\nSo as I stated above, Southern Witchcrafts is a vegan base. The current base is their 2nd iteration, which I feel is a real step up from their previous version. Personally, I prefer tallow over vegan but this base really stood out to. Lathering up from the soap puck was effortless, as this is a medium to soft soap and this boar brush was going to take no for an answer. I **swirled** the Thater for maybe 30 or so seconds and the lather was already starting, so straight to the face I went. I normally load heavy so I needed to add water a few times to really get it going, but once I did, the lather became very voluptuous, dense and slick. Normally, I do two passes but I am growing the beard back out so I only cleaned up the cheeks and neck. I always go XTG on my neck, as that is really the only way I can get a close shave without irritation and WTG/XTG/ATG on my cheeks. Soap helped glide the razor across my skin with no issues. Results were stellar. No weepers, creepers, nicks, cuts, butts or coconuts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Overall\n\nI highly recommend checking out Southern Witchcrafts offerings. They have quite different scent offerings compared to other artisans. Their V2 base is quite stellar and I look forward to the next offerings from Southern Witchcrafts. If you're looking for some recommendations, I highly recommend Autumn Ash and Necromantic.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#Disclaimer\nI purchased this soap with my own money, leave me alone /u/Hyvasuomi79. Thater Boar was received as a PIF from u/dendj55.\n",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 28th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Wet the Face Spices From the Sea](https://i.imgur.com/QSjRotb.jpg)\n\nSpices From the Sea was not on my radar until u/OnionMiasma mentioned it a few Spice Offs ago just as I was seeing the light at the end of the tunnel of this series. Like Willy Wonka guiding a tour boat through a tunnel on a chocolate river he stretched the madness out even longer and I can only ~~hate him forever~~ thank him for it. To be honest, Wet the Face wasn't really on my radar as a brand in general. They don't get much play in these parts so I hadn't really poked around the store.\n\nWet the Face was founded by Donald Youngner as an online shaving community (yes, really. There are places where people just get together and talks about shaving. The Internet is weird.) But eventually he decided to make his own soap, went and learned how to from a soapmaker, and now has a glut of soaps you can buy, while still maintaining a regular shave blog, YouTube page, and a plethora of online shaving communities across the social medias. Meanwhile, the moderators of r/wetshaving can barely mod a single page and have not turned The Great Spice Off into the hit TV show it should be. How lazy.\n\nI actually joined Wet the Face on Facebook, where I've heard tell in the past wetshaving communities were pretty big. Everyone's pretty nice over there, though on the whole, it's mostly dead. I watched some of his YouTube shaves as well. Seems like a nice guy but I'm sure someone in the comments will inform me of how he's a horrible person and eats baby seals. But we're not here to discuss everyone sucking and the slow death of wet shaving as we know it as the inevitable destruction of this and all other wet shaving communities creeps ever slower. We're here to discuss soap.\n\nSpices From the Sea is a direct dupe of Old Spice, which the page says is \"my take on the original or classic scent of Old Spice. Old Spice original was launched in 1938.\" However, all the text after that is copied directly from the Fragnatica page for Old Spice and I think Wikipedia, leading mean to think it may not indeed be his at all but an \"off-the-shelf\" pre-blend dupe. Wet the Face does make some of his own fragrances so there's every chance it is indeed his creation too. Either way, that isn't a ding as every soap offers its own unique scent even if it is a purchased dupe. Anyway, I spent the hours and hours it takes to copy and paste scent notes from one page to another on my Spicy Man review so I'm not going to do it again and risk cramping my Crtl+C fingers.\n\nWhile Wet the Face has two soap bases, a vegan and a tallow, Spices From the Sea only comes in the vegan base. Actually, all but four of their scents come in the vegan base so I'd say the vegan base is the default for them.  Ingredients are stearic acid, coconut oil, distilled water, potassium hydroxide, castor oil, glycerin, sodium hydroxide, lanolin, sodium lactate, shea butter, and fragrance. Literally nothing out of the ordinary hear to the point of the list feeling almost cliche but it's got all the fixings of a solid soap. (Edit: As u/wyze0ne noted the base has lanolin, which comes from lambs and thus is not vegan despite being listed as vegan on the Wet the Face webpage.)\n\nNow onto something I usually pass over with one sentence but here cannot: the soaps firmness and feel. Usually, that's either soft or hard or somewhere in between but Spices From the Sea is the weirdest feeling soap I've ever had. It's definitely a soft soap and visually when you open it it looks like any other soap and you'd guess it was firm. However, the moment you touch it that all goes out the window. This base isn't soft, it's slimey. Scooping it is a chore as it sticks to your fingers like Slimer from The Ghostbusters just gave them a sloppy kiss. I can't imagine brush loading this stuff but at points struggled so hard to get it off my scoop and into my bowl because it wouldn't come off my fingers that I almost did it. So, yeah, I'm adding another category to soap firmness: slime.\n\nSpices of the Sea's packaging and labeling are pretty nice, with a boat on the sea on the front in a sepia tone and an acceptably maritime font. It's also just a great name for an Old Spice dupe and I like that some thought actually went into it versus some of the other names out there (looking at you \"Old Spice Type\").\n\n**Oldness: 3**\n\nThis is one of the more challenging Oldness ratings I've had to give because Spices From the Sea unfolds like no other Old Spice dupe I've used, presenting almost all the notes of Old Spice but never at the same time. When you unscrew the lid and sniff the puck it's almost nothing but cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg (the spices), but upon lathering the soap the citrus literally explodes out of it becoming nearly the only smell it has, upon everything settling on your face the musk and cedar take over. It's all there but never together. I've never had a scent unfold like this and I have no idea why. The end result, though, is that it both is and isn't a great Old Spice dupe, which is hard for my simple brain to comprehend.\n\n**Spiciness: 5**\n\nWhich is why we have a spiciness category! It's just plain fun to enjoy a kind of unpacking of a scent I love. There have been other soaps that change and morph into different things when lathered but never so distinctly and so separately and it's a really cool experience. All the while the scent maintains the *je ne sais quoi* of Old Spice meaning it still hit all the right nostalgia keys as well.\n\n**Lather: 2**\n\nThis should be a three but I am docking a point for having to put my fingers in slimey stuff just to get the soap into a bowl. Maybe you like slime and if that's the case add a point to your personal score. Once you do have the soap in your bowl Spices of the Sea explodes very quickly and very big, almost overflowing my bowl every time I used it no matter how big the scoop was. This is a stupid big soap but that does come at the price of thickness. The soap never quite seems to get that nice sheen that a solidly thick soap does, instead staying a bit airy... and big... just... so much soap. Like, it may still be producing soap behind my back.\n\n**Shave: 4**\n\nSometimes, when my first shave is with a mild razor, I go a bit too fast because a soap is slicker than I expected. Well, with Spices From the Sea my razor slid down my face so quickly it I nearly dropped it as I shouted out \"Slow down, Speed Racer!\" at it because I speak to my razors. This is just an insanely slick soap, which, maybe I should have guessed given the slime aspect. Mild and medium razors sail down your face with it easily and quickly. The downside comes when you're using a more aggressive razor. While the slickness obviously helps, there's just not enough cushion to deliver a great-feeling shave with a more aggressive razor.\n\n**Post: 3**\n\nSpices From the Sea absolutely destroys in complimenting both vintage and Indian Old Spice aftershave. I mean they slap together like peanut butter and jelly. Like  James Bond and a martini. Like wet shaving and men with far too much time on their hands. Why a three then? Because it doesn't do much of anything else. With all the oils and the shea butter I would have expected to feel super soft but, instead, my face either felt a bit dry or just kind off. Just nothing special here after the shave.\n\n**Final: 17**\n\nSpices From the Sea is easily up there on the high end of the slickness scale, delivering a soap that lathers up massive and allows milder razors to shave like they're nothing. Sadly, it's slimey base leads to a struggle to lather and its post shave isn't that great. That's all a shame because it has one of the more intriguing scents that unpacks like nothing I've used previously. Now, if you'll excuse me I think there's still some soap overflowing from my shaving bowl.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

    "body": "I finally got the chance to make another batch of soap, iterating, tinkering and learning in the process. That means its time for another PIF.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/hritjp6](https://imgur.com/a/hritjp6)\n\nFor grabs is a 4oz tin of my lastest batch. Scent dominated by Juniper, with hints of Clary Sage, Warm Woods, and Patchouli, it reminded me of some time I spent in Sedona, AZ. A high desert smell with a dose of hippie.\n\nThis batch omits the beer and mead in the Kitchen Sink formula, but adds a bit more NaOH to the lye ratio, and introduces a little Sodium Lactate (a hardener), Tetrasodium EDTA (a chelation agent to improve performance in hard water), and Titanium Dioxide (to give it a creamy whiteness and possible secondary use as a stylish sunblock\\*). The result was, well, weird. The consistency is a bit like a thick putty, but after using it for a week, I can say that it makes for a prodigious lather. Frankly, I quite like it.\n\n(For what is it worth, I'm throwing in a 1oz tin of SEDONA with the next three orders of Kitchen Sink placed on our square site.)\n\nThis PIF is open to all in the USA. International are welcome, but I'll cover just the first $5 of postage. The rest is on you.\n\nLatherbot lottery 50 24\n\n\\*Do NOT use it as a sunblock. That would be foolish.",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/8liyUCGdMsM)\n\nPhoenix Artisan Accoutrements ([https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/](https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/)) has been transitioning their scents into their latest soap base. Many of their latest offerings have been released in this soap base, known as CK-6, despite being originally released for their Doppleganger line of premium soaps. PAA offers preshaves, soaps, aftershaves, and shaving hardware through their website. The PAA brand is one that is widely popular in the wet shaving community despite many missteps ([https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9yz4ep/wiki\\_entry\\_phoenix\\_artisan\\_accoutrements/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/9yz4ep/wiki_entry_phoenix_artisan_accoutrements/)). As always, I encourage consumers to research small business and decide for themselves. Although I will continue to review the brand, I do not support them by purchasing and rely strictly on loaner sets in order to provide reviews at the requests of viewers. PAA is hosting a shaving meet up “The Big Shave Southwest” ([https://bigshavesouthwest.com/](https://bigshavesouthwest.com/)) in Chandler, Arizona on April 27, 2019 if you are in the area and care to check it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlanet Java Hive is a blend of honey and coffee. The scent is a cloyingly sweet gourmand type scent. With a backbone of coffee, the top is pure sweet honey. The fragrance reminds me of something you would find ordered at a coffee shop by someone who is unfit to drink coffee the way it is intended to be consumed (black). This scent is not for me. Being a fan of coffee and scents based on the richness of coffee, this misses the mark. Mrs. Ruds disapproves of this scent because of the sweetness as well. PAA is known for their strongly scented soaps and this one is no different. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe new base is known as CK-6 in the wet shaving community and according to the website features the addition of Bacuri Butter, Cupuacu Butter and Murumuru Butter. Overall the ingredients are listed as: Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Potassium Kokumate, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Castorate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoa Butterate, Potassium Avocadoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Capuacu) Butter, Astrocaryum (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Platonia Insignis (Bacuri) Seed Butter, Parfum \\[Fragrance\\]. The soap is soft and care needs to be taken to not overload your brush because it is also insanely thirsty. The lather explodes with water and when properly dialed in resembles Cool Whip. Slickness is improved, both primary and residual aspects are noticeably better than the regular PAA soap base. Post shave also improves upon the regular PAA base. This soap delivers on it’s promise to bridge the tallow gap, much like Catie’s Bubbles, Wholly Kaw and Grooming Dept have previously done. Considering the improvements, the ShaveScore for the CK-6 soap base is a 92. Soaps with a similar overall performance are: Wholly Kaw vegan and Southern Witchcrafts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Phoenix Artisan Planet Java Hive (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Showtime” (purchased)\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* ​Post - Phoenix Artisan Planet Java Hive (loaner)",

    "body": "Holy Snails - Double Shark Serum\n\nPart or writing this review meant going back to January 2019 and re-reading my review of a very similar product, from the same brand, and with the same name...well...let me back up LOL!\n\nIf you are not familiar with Holy Snails...you need to be. Check out my previous review about one of their offerings for an in-depth description. But in essence, they are a US based (but K-Beauty inspired) e-retailer out of Alabama.\n\nThe owner/founder (Chel) is herself a K-Beauty blogger and K-Pop nerd. She alongside three other K-Beauty queens host a podcast called The Snailcast. They cover all things Korean/Asian beauty from skincare to makeup...and don’t hold punches when it comes to calling trends/brands out. \n\nI’ve been so informed and guided by their content in the past two years or so of diving into K-Beauty (okay...back to the review at hand). \n\nThe first product from Holy Snails to hit my routine was the Shark Sauce: Sauce Du Mois Hanbang Edition. That product is a spin-off of their original Shark Sauce Serum that features Niacinamide and Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nAdding Ginseng Root, Ginger Root, and Goji Berry Root Extracts to the special edition formula created something I absolutely fell in love with. The brightening and hydrating power of the product (even with its slight sticky residue) made me a believer in all things Shark Sauce and Holy Snails.\n\nCut to a year and a half later and I have another spin-off of the original Shark Sauce in my hands. This time...it's the Double Shark.\n\nRather than adding wonderful Hnabang-style ingredients to the original formula, only one thing is changed...double the Niacinamide! Double Shark brings the concentration of Niacinamide to 10% vs 5% found in the original. \n\nNeedless to say, I was curious to see how this product performed against the Hanbang version since that one also contains just 5% Niacinamide.\n\nAside from the formulation...there were some clear differences between the two products. I found Double Shark to be a little more fluid/watery. Also, while the Hanbang Shark had a slightly sweet/honey scent...Double Shark has no real scent that I noticed. \n\nBut, the biggest initial difference was in feel and application. My one complaint with Hanbang Shark was the slightly sticky/tacky residue left behind after applying the product. My workaround for this was mixing it into my moisturizer (which worked nicely and resolved the issue).\n\nBut, Double Shark...she (or he, or neither/both) does not play like that. I LOVED the way this serum absorbed into my skin without any trace of sticky-ness. I found myself applying a couple of thin layers to amp up the benefits. It also worked fine mixed in with my moisturizer. \n\nThe consistency and result after application made Double Shark a bit more versatile and approachable when compared to Hanbang Shark.\n\nOutside of that...I found both products to perform similarly. Both offer a great amount of brightening, skin tone balancing, and hydrating power. It’s been over a year since I used the Hanbang Shark but my review of the two products would read pretty much the same.\n\nIn practice, I don’t think I noticed anything major that the Hanbang-style ingredients did that Double Shark missed. Nor did I notice the increase of Niacinamide having a major difference on my skin as compared to the 5% in the Hanbang Shark or original Shark Sauce. \n\nAll in all..it was pretty much a tie for me. If I was particularly mad at the sticky residue of the Hanbang Shark (which I wasn’t) I’d go for the Double Shark. If I really missed that sweet/honey scent of the Hanbang Shark...that’s where I would land. \n\nEither way, the Shark Sauce line from Holy Snails seems to be a knockout product no matter which iteration you select.\n\nI look forward to exploring the other Sauce Du Mois options to see what ingredients take Shark Sauce to the next level. It’s nice to know that regardless...each bottle will help to brighten, hydrate, and bring that K-Beauty glow to my skin that I have come to love.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Distilled Water, Lactobacillus/Nereocystis Luetkeana Ferment Filtrate (Sea Kelp Bioferment), Niacinamide, Licorice Root Extract, N-Acetylglucosamine, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea Extract, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Holy Snails $34.00 USD): [https://www.holysnails.com/products/double-shark](https://www.holysnails.com/products/double-shark) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nilnzfhjbeh51.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3af6c1fe6f47dd3c6144cc033a97b775897dcd29",

This is my 4th soap I’ve ever made, and maybe I shot a little above my skill level. As you can see the TD and natural indigo pigment didn’t fully disperse and left flecks all throughout.. although I think this should only affect it aesthetically. I wanted the bottom layer to be much darker than how it came out, so I guess I didn’t add enough activated charcoal. I completely forgot to add the sodium lactate and this recipe has a 10% water discount, so it was a lot of fun trying to un-mold this beast. Overall I’ve learned: tiny whisk is not good enough for TD- always use the mini blender. Natural indigo pigment has to be dispersed in water- not oil. And try not to forget the sodium lactate! \n\nScented with: BB Coastal Rain (which caused a slight discoloration as well).",

Anyways.\n\nThis is how my lazy ass make my niacinamide serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Finished product](https://preview.redd.it/76og9kh9eax21.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c70dbcf0bf953989f025ab78f0bd88167cfa39d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

Wash your filthy hands\n2. Wipe everything down with alcohol or boil your stuff to sanitize - even the table/work area\n3. Put down some paper towels\n4. Weigh out powders then add to beaker, press Tare\n5. Weight out liquid germall plus and distilled water and add to same beaker, mix til powders dissolve, press Tare\n6. Weigh out sepiplus 400 then add to the same beaker\n7. ~~Spice~~ Mix it well\n8. That's it\n\nI'm super lazy so I just add all the powders & watery stuff in one beaker then just dump the sepiplus 400 in there. But don't do this kids. You will mess up the %. Like I did when my hand slipped and accidentally added like 1. something grams instead of 0.2%. -\\_-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdeal pH for niacinamide is pH 6. But it can be 5 or 7 too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may look like a lot but it actually only takes like 10 minutes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Changes you can make:**\n\n\\- Leave out sepiplus 400 to get a toner, but why? It'll be annoyingly watery. >:(\n\n\\- How thick you want this;  If you want slightly thicker watery feel, you can do 0.2-0.5% Sepiplus 400.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this is probably like 0.7-1&#37; lmao idk](https://preview.redd.it/8sfgabbcsax21.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a16106c6a4c23820d467280c141bb3fb93c95536)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnu7afgw3bx21.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8480c2938a7bb0ab06d3efa5f37d8f6892865b6e\n\n\\- Add 2-3% sepiplus 400 & 5-10% fav oil if you want a cream gel like this.

FOR THE LOVE GOD DON'T USE MINERAL OIL AT THIS LEVEL, SUPER HEAVY & GREASYYY. I wanted to add squalane oil but I ran out. So I just used whatever oil was in my bathroom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***SLIGHTLY FANCIER RECIPE***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/974khbjpgax21.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ecaa3be11def2cf2eb451e54cded0294911e820\n\nI bought all my ingredients at [Lotioncrafter](https://lotioncrafter.com/). It costs a bit upfront but it's coo bc you get to 3432435 serums for pennies later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I added the things I did:**\n\n[**Sepiplus 400**](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/sepiplus-400)**:** This sounds expensive but you literally only need a few drops at a time so it's gonna last til you die, probably. This is a cold process emulsifier. **Heating & holding** to a certain temp. is **super important** for DIY, but if you're incredibly lazy like me, then it's a good choice bc it's really easy to use & you don't have to worry about pH levels (Stable between pH 2.5 - pH 11)\n\nTexture: feels kinda sticky when you first put it on but it dries to feel like NOTHING by itself. Takes a little while to absorb, me thinks. But with extracts and humectants and oils added, it obviously will feel different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Niacinamide**](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/vitamin-b3-niacinamide-usp)**:** you know it's good. That's why you here. 5% is where efficacy peaks, so you don't, like, need 10%. I add 6% bc why not.\n\nIt helps strengthen your skin barrier, is soothing, smoothing, and helps fade acne marks. I love how it smooths out my nasty skin texture. Olay cream or random 5% milky niacinamide serum on amazon = same results.  (Ideally, pH 6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**N-Acetyl Glucosamine**](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/n-acetyl-glucosamine-nag)**:** You only really need 2.5% to get results, but I like adding 3-4%. Boosts niacinamide up like crazy to fade spots, treat sun damage, heals, etc. LC lists all the benefits. [(Stable at pH 5\\~7)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/2cp57d/diy_101_active_ingredients_and_ph/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Allantoin:** reparative, soothing. Good for sensitive skin. Don't add more than 0.5% bc it's not gonna dissolve that well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hyrolyzed oats:** Good for sensitive skin. Film former and real nice. Don't need to add this. If you hate stickiness with every fiber of your being, don't add this. Mine's a glycerin base, which gives a slightly sticky feel. Next time I'm gonna use green tea extract instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Propylene glycol:** Again, don't need to add. It's a penetration enhancer and helps with the serum's viscosity. It's what they use to deliver meds into the skin in medical formulations or whatever. But lots of other things help penetration stuff into your skin, like oils/fats, so don't sweat over it. Some people are sensitive to this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Liquid germall plus**](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/liquid-germall-plus): is a good preservative, easy to use, stable. You HAVE to use a preservative. Any time you use water or water containing shit like honey, hydrosols, etc. you hAVE TO. I don't make the rules.\n\nYou can leave it out if you like to spread around a bunch of moldy and nasty germy shit all over your face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Distilled water** \\- the body of the serum. You can use other stuff like aloe and hydrosols or whatever but this is cheaper and easier. If you add too many botanical stuff you have to add 0.2% or so disodium EDTA and the like so your creations don't get all nasty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvrzu4kuwax21.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b58085f450dc58bdf76d75fc2904ed66b2357ffc\n\nIt won't kill you if you don't test the pH but if you want, you can buy some from a reputable brand that has 1-14. I use [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S1ULSY8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\nThe pH came out to be 5 at the end and I could have left it at that but for some odd reason I wanted it higher. Idk. I used water mixed with Triethanolamine to bring up the pH and [citric acid](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/citric-acid) mixed with water to bring it down. Clench your ass cheeks proper and use only a few drops at a time if you're going to do this!!\n\nI think you'll probably be around pH 5\\~7 if you use distilled water and don't add too much other stuff.\n\nIf you're super bothered by it, then this recipe I came up with came out to be pH 6:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvbh24v19bx21.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=0beeea1d06e149ff5c611fdf3dd5e2a4090e2e0d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Changes you can make:**\n\n\\- You can replace propylene glycol with 3% propanediol 1, 3. It's a humectant. Or add other humectants like glycerin, honeyquat, sodium PCA, sodium lactate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Add 2% for a thicker gel if u want & add some of your fav oil(s) to 5\\~15% to get a milkier cream gel. The one I made is an aqueous gel, bc it doesn't have oil. I'm gonna experiment with adding oils like squalane, seabuckthorn berry, pomegranate, babassu oil someday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do use an oil, just do the same thing but add the oil with sepiplus 400, mix, then pour all the water stuff into the oil stuff and mix it well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You can swap out or add hydrolyzed oats with licorice root extract to make it even more brightening. Or other extracts like green tea, centella, calendula, chamomile, etc. Don't be a greedy butthole and add too many extracts. You pro want 5% at max, bc it's gonna get sticky. Unless you have them in a different base, [like alcohol, water, ferment, or whatever](https://www.formulatorsampleshop.com/Extracts-s/3523.htm). Just remember that actives will give you infinitely better results than random plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- You can also replace hydrolyzed oats with other hydrolyzed proteins like rice, baobab, wheat, silk. Use at 0.5\\~2.5% total.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Add 2% [alpha arbutin](https://lotioncrafter.com/products/alpha-arbutin) if you want even more brightening. But if you add propylene glycol, only add 0.2%. Arbutin is stable at pH 3.5\\~6. So pH 5 or 6 should be fine for the end product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut try things with more experienced [DIYers recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/) before trying to come up with your own!\n\nShoutout to [Susan](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/blog/) for all the learning material!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT (08/15/2019): Hello, all! I'm sorry to poop all over this post, but I have found that cold process, FOR ME, does not give the same results as what I get from commercial niacinamide products. This is totally an anecdotal thing, so keep that in mind, but I think I'm having penetration/efficacy issues. **So I don't recommend cold process niacinamide serum anymore.** However, it seems to still work out for Susan?? If you do want to make niacinamide serum, I suggest using heat and hold and mixing the stuff at the same temp. and using another ingredient to prevent recrystallization and keep things well-mixed.  \n\n[**Info from professional chemists**](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/4592/is-there-anything-i-can-do-to-make-this-product-actually-effective-on-my-skin) **on the penetration/recrystallization issue.** [One talking about powdery residue.](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/4346/sticky-feeling-and-powdery-residue-issues-with-serum-formula)\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/8q6ynv/anyone_have_an_idea_as_to_why_this_serum_formula/) mentions DMI for that, but I think I've read in other posts that some other ingredients can do the same, but I can't remember on top of my head.\n\nThe Ordinary's uses DMI in their niacinamide serum, while other companies use certain glycols, like 2sol's Facial Recovery Booster & Good Molecules 10% niacinamide serum, etc. You may also want to look for niacinamide serums with fat/oils added to it, which I thinkkkk may help with penetration, like Eva Natural's 5% niacinamide serum for example.",

    "body": "*Before we begin and before there are 20 questions in the comments about what's wrong with PAA, you can find the wiki* [*on it here*](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/wiki/artisanwiki/paa)*. It's everyone's own choice whether or not to buy from PAA (I personally have stopped, but bought a brush from them before I knew the history that I still use) but I obtained this soap through a third party for the purpose of being a completionist and to review a soap many who do buy from PAA might want to hear about. With that out of the way, I'll review the soap without any commentary toward the makers themselves.*\n\nHello and welcome to the 15th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Cold Spices](https://i.imgur.com/mxWbbkm.jpg)\n\nPAA's Cold Spices is unique in the world of Old Spics dupes in that it is the only dupe that comes mentholated. Thus the name of Cold Spices, which, as a father, I can appreciate that level of dad joke punning in a name. It was also the first mentholated soap I've ever used, though I do use a tonic that has menthol in it before and after my shaves. As such this was somewhat of a new experience for my face and when reading the review you should probably take into account how much you like menthol or not. It turns out, it's not my favorite thing ever in a soap. I don't especially love that brisk feeling for the extended amount of time that the soap sits on your face. It isn't bad but probably not for me in the long run. As such, you may want to add a point to the score here or there if you find that feel pleasant.\n\nI got the soap in PAA's CK-6 formula, which is their more fancier (and $10 more expensive) base featuring exotic oils and things that are supposed to make it better than the soap without the exotic oils. I've never used their normal base so I can't compare (maybe a review in the future if I find a tub) but I figured reviewing their best version is best anyway. The ingredients in this fancy formula are: Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Potassium Kokumate, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Castorate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoa Butterate, Potassium Avocadoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Capuacu) Butter, Astrocaryum (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Platonia Insignis (Bacuri) Seed Butter, Menthol, Parfum \\[Fragrance\\]. That's definitely a few oils and butter you don't see that often.\n\nThe soap is said to be lightly mentholated but I don't have anything to compare to so I'm not going to. Obviously, this makes it not a direct dupe, though I wouldn't call it a riff or different take on it either. It's definitely going for a dupe scent but just with some menthol put in. The description doesn't really give any indication of what they were aiming for other than to mention that girls talked to the soapmaker in high school at one point and made him star using Bay Rum instead so... good for him.\n\nThis is one of the softest soaps I've used (maybe it's all the exotic butter and oils!) with almost no firmness to it and a penchant for giving you more soap than you really need. It's weirdly deceptive when you scoop it, at first looking like it'll have some solidity to it and then bam you've suddenly scooped out half the tub. I didn't brush load but I can see this easily loading a ton if you did it that way. The soap is a light tan/brownish color and I dig the label of an old ship sailing on a wave of snow all tinted in red. Though it kind of looks like some mammoths or elephants are pulling the ship. Not sure what that is. PAA has some weird story things built into their labels and marketing.\n\n**Oldness: 3**\n\nThis is actually a pretty solid Old Spice dupe... except for the menthol. The scent off the puck gives you that familiar kick... except for the menthol. I think a bit more citrus on the nose could bring it to perfection... except for the menthol. Even more so when lathered, when the citrus usually drops and the base notes come in, this gives a great Old Spice scent... except for the menthol. Did I mention the menthol? It changes things, in case I wasn't clear. It adds an astringent scent to the proceedings that kind of sharpens the entire scent and brings the spices forward more. Not saying this is bad but it hits the Oldness down.\n\n**Spiciness: 4**\n\nSee it's not bad! I actually really dig the twist on the scent that the menthol delivers even if I don't especially love the menthol itself. I like that PAA went with something different here and is giving us something unique. The menthol delivers a scent that's brisk and a bit harsher than OG Old Spice and I'm kind of here for it. Plus, this rating is called spiciness so something that adds a \"spicy\" tingle to your face should probably get some credit, right?\n\n**Lather: 3**\n\nPAA's CK-6 formula is a bitch to lather. I didn't actually get it dialed in until the third shave when I finally was able to balance the right amount of water and soap. Part of the problem is the softness. I just kept getting more soap than I wanted. Couple that with the fact that it's insanely thirsty and it just takes a bit to find the spot. Cold Spices never whips into the best lather, being a bit airy, but when I did finally get the balance right it was a solid one. I just don't want to have to struggle to find it this much. This is getting a three because I did find it but could have easily been a two if I hadn't.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nThe same goes for the shave. My first shave with this soap was far to thick with not enough slickness at all no matter how much water I put in. In fairness, I had scooped much more soap than I meant to but the same happened for the second. Descent comfort but not enough slickness. On the third shave I finally found it and got a good, slick shave out of the soap with a surprisingly good amount of residual slickness that stuck around wonderfully. The menthol definitely makes your cheeks wake up too but I'm just not sure it's for me but I'm not deducting any points for its inclusion for the shave.\n\n**Post: 2**\n\nHere's where it's losing points and you can add one back on if you'd like to if you dig menthol. I just did not like the lasting menthol feeling on my face. I love it in my tonic but it stuck around way too long after the shave. Not only that, but my face felt a bit sticky after shaving for Cold Spices. It didn't last all day or anything, but it was there a bit, like too much moisturizer had been put on or something. Maybe it was the menthol. The scent on the other hand blended so well with the aftershave and honestly saved this post-shave from being a one. As I mentioned, the astringent nature of the menthol actually really compliments Old Spice smell-wise.\n\n**Final Verdict: 15**\n\nPAA Cold Spices definitely delivers a mentholated Old Spice dupe and I'd encourage those who like menthol to consider it and probably add 2-3 points to this score (putting it in good standing with other mid-range scores). However, the soap itself is tricky to get dialed in and when you don't have it dialed it underperforms. When you do get it, though, it's got some truly fantastic slickness to it and a good consistent cushion... it's just more effort than other soaps to find it. I wish the post-shave felt a bit better too, especially since many of the ingredients are claimed to leave your face soft, but I felt nothing special.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

I own soaps from a lot of the big names, (Stirling, A&E, B&M, SA, Razorock) and in my opinion it is arguably the best performing soap i have.\n\nGreat review and thanks for the info regarding PAA and its controversy.",

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). Anthropophagy is a Spring seasonal release from SW. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering directly, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nAnthropophagy pays homage to Thomas Harris, the creator of Hannibal Lecter, the protagonist in the all time great film, Silence of the lambs. The fragrance is modeled after a hand cream that is said to have been used by Lecter, and present on the letters he sent to Clarice Starling in the film. Scent notes feature: Tonka bean, musk, lavender, cotton, amyris wood and hedione. True to form, the fragrance is a soft, clean smelling accord highlighted by lavender and cotton. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She finds it somewhat pleasant but not something she gravitates to me wearing. Strength of scent is mid-strong once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Soap Commander Devotion as a comparable scent profile. \n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Anthropophagy (promotional gift)\n* Brush -​ Dogwood Handcrafts “Darkness” (purchased)\n* Razor - HomeLikeShaving Safe Start 1.18 (loaner)\n* Post - Catie’s Bubbles Ménage a Lavande (purchased)",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/NJ8-S33rJdc)\n\nPhoenix Artisan Accoutrements ([https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/](https://phoenixartisanaccoutrements.com/)) has been transitioning their latest scents into their latest soap base. Many of their latest offerings have been released in this soap base, known as CK-6, despite being originally released for their Doppleganger line of premium soaps. PAA offers preshaves, soaps, aftershaves, and shaving hardware through their website. The PAA brand is one that is widely popular in the wet shaving community. They are hosting a shaving meet up “The Big Shave Southwest” ([https://bigshavesouthwest.com/](https://bigshavesouthwest.com/)) in Chandler, Arizona on April 27, 2019. \n\nSupreme Sandalwood Science is a blend of Australian, Hawaiian and Indian Sandalwood. This blend offers a taste of all the wonderful traits a sandalwood can display. It opens semi-sweet before some warm creaminess moves into play. The body of the scent is woody and natural. To my nose, this smells like an improved variation of the popular Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood scent. This scent is right in my wheelhouse but Mrs. Ruds gives it two thumbs down, as she doesn’t like earthy scents in general. Strength of scent is strong both off the container and remains this way once lathered. Similar smells from wet shaving are: Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood and Fine Santal Absolut. \n\nThe new base is known as CK-6 in the wet shaving community and according to the website features the addition of Bacuri Butter, Cupuacu Butter and Murumuru Butter. Overall the ingredients are listed as: Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Potassium Kokumate, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Castorate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoa Butterate, Potassium Avocadoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Capuacu) Butter, Astrocaryum (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Platonia Insignis (Bacuri) Seed Butter, Parfum \\[Fragrance\\]. The soap is soft and care needs to be taken to not overload your brush because it is also insanely thirsty. The lather explodes with water and when properly dialed in resembles Cool Whip. Slickness is improved, both primary and residual aspects are noticeably better than the regular PAA soap base. Post shave also improves upon the regular PAA base. This soap delivers on it’s promise to bridge the tallow gap, much like Catie’s Bubbles, Wholly Kaw and Grooming Dept have previously done. Considering the improvements, the ShaveScore for the CK-6 soap base is a 92. Soaps with a similar overall performance are: Wholly Kaw vegan and Noble Otter.  \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Supreme Sandalwood Science (loaner)\n* Brush - Hess Deluxe 5 (gift)\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher Buffalo (gift)\n* ​Post - Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Supreme Sandalwood Science (loaner) ",

    "body": "**Video Link:**\n\n[Click Here](https://youtu.be/eiUUuj4L7LQ)\n\n**Disclosure Statements**\n\n* The Hecho SMA shaving soap and aftershave serum were kindly gifted by u/RobInFresno\n* I bought the Dogwood Handcrafts/Maggard Timberwolf brush with my own money\n* I bought the GEM Damaskeene (Open Comb) with my own money\n\n**Write-up**:\n\n[Hecho SMA](https://www.hechosma.com/) is a cosmetics and grooming company based in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. In addition to making things like bar soaps, hand washes, and pomades, they also make a few shaving items such as shaving soap, cream, and aftershaves. Thanks to u/RobInFresno, this week I was able to try out their shaving soap “Sweet Lumberjack” and their bergamot aftershave serum.\n\nHecho SMA’s shaving soaps all have a relatively simple formula, which includes ingredients like shea, kokum, jojoba, rice bran oil, and other essential soap ingredients like glycerin and sodium lactate. Their shaving soaps are also advertised as being suitable for beard washing, so it makes sense that they have smaller ingredients list and come as circular bars of soap, unlike the typical American artisan soaps. The Spanish name for the soap scent is “Madera Especiada”, which roughly translates to “spiced wood”, which I think better describes the scent I perceive off the soap. It’s lightly scented and I don’t think it would offend anyone. Thanks to the help of r/wetshaving’s newest soaper u/USS-Spongebob, I’m inclined to believe that all of the scents in this soap are added with essential oils, as things like patchouli, lime, and citrus are written at the end of the ingredients list, but there are no other fragrances listed.\n\nPerformance wise, I found the soap incredibly easy to lather up with both a boar and synthetic brush. You can load the brush with basically any amount of water in your brush, as some days I started with a very dry brush and others with a very wet brush, yet I was able to achieve good results with both methods. The ease of lather reminded me of the vintage Colgate soap I reviewed several weeks ago. Is it coincidence that they are both hard pucks of soap? I think not! Hecho SMA’s lather has a bit more density and luxury feeling compared to Colgate, and they are similar in terms of not having much residual slickness, which isn’t a deal-breaker for me. With the addition of a few ingredients and changes in proportions of others, this could easily become an excellent soap. This soap retails for 265 Pesos ($13 USD), and I think it is worth the price. Overall, it’s an easy to use, *good* soap that could surely serve a purpose in some people’s shave dens worldwide.\n\nFor post-shave this week I exclusively used a sample of Hecho SMA’s aftershave serum, which has simple, pleasant bergamot scent. This serum is the oiliest one I’ve used compared to the other balm-like ones I’ve used in the past, but it doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily whatsoever. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves a satisfying feel that would seem to compliment the usually warmer weather in a place like San Miguel de Allende. The aftershave is advertised as a botanical serum containing ingredients like argan oil, rice bran oil, meadowfoam oil, cucumber extract, and sea buckthorn extract. Retailing at 645 Pesos or $30 USD for 50mL of product, this seems like a fair price to me. The next time I order something from Mexico I’ll look to include a full-sized bottle of the serum with my shipment ☺\n\n**Next week** I’ll be continuing the international theme and reviewing a soap and aftershave from Croatia, which were kindly sent to me for review. They both smell great and I’m excited to use them for all of this coming week. Until next time, thank you all for reading this review and watching my videos!",

Their goals are to offer bold, classy scent in high quality formulations for consumers. They offer a wide range of scents from ground up fragrance ideas, collaborations with fragrances houses and duplications of popular fragrances for men. Having no membership requirement like The Club’s Backroom, Ariana & Evans is accessible to all and is among my favorite current artisans. Ariana & Evans which is available at these third party retailers; Maggard Razors ( [http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), Smallflower ([https://www.smallflower.com/](https://www.smallflower.com/)), Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)) and TVB Shaving ([https://tvbshaving.com/](https://tvbshaving.com/)). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpartacus is the A&E homage to the celebrated Aventus by Creed. The accord features notes of: Pineapple, Birch, Black Currant, Musk, Oakmoss, Bergamot, Apple, Patchouli, Ambergris, Jasmine, Vanilla and Rose. This scent is one of the most favored in wet shaving and for good reason. It is complex and masculine. I am initially met with a smoky pineapple and black currant shot before the scent becomes too complex to pull out individual notes. This scent is Mrs. Ruds approved and is among my favorite scents in all of wet shaving and fragrance. Scent strength is strong out of the tube and remains strong once lathered. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Declaration Grooming Sellout, Fine Accoutrements Platinum, Stirling Soap Co. Executive Man, Murphy and McNeil Trinity and Viking Soaps Ragnar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAriana & Evans uses a tallow and goat milk based soap. Ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Shea Butter, Strangistó Giaoúrti, Potassium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Mango Butter, Cocoa Butter, Manteca (Lard), Glycerin, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Camellia Oil, Bentonite Clay, Beeswax, Sodium Lactate, Argan Oil, Fragrance & EO's.The soap remains on the firmer side of the spectrum and loads effortlessly into your brush fiber of choice and is a very thirsty soap. When dialed in, the lather resembles greek yogurt. The slickness is elite in both primary slickness and residual slickness. Post shave rises above all and provides the best post shave experience I have had to date. The resulting ShaveScore is a 96. Similarly performing soaps are Barrister and Mann and Talbot Shaving v2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Ariana & Evans Spartacus (purchased)\n* Brush - ​Mocek “Maul” (purchased)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Ariana & Evans Spartacus (purchased) ",

    "body": "Hi all! I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (°C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 °C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong.

Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility.

Used Betaine as pH adjuster;\n\n>4. Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\nBetaine (also called N,N,N-trimethylglycine) isn't a pH adjuster because it's largely zwitterionic in solution, and has a pKa of around 2.33, and so won't be appreciably protonated (i.e. taking up protons to buffer the solution) until after you've protonated a >50% of the salicylic acid. However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information! Thanks for putting this together!",

This drop supports the charity Restore NYC (https://restorenyc.org/), to which Mammoth Soaps donates $1 per tub sold to fight human trafficking. \n\nAlmond Leather is Mammoth’s first attempt at a simplistic scent. Notes featured are: Leather, Almond, Orange Blossom and Frankincense. This is a leather forward accord, a soft suede like leather is the main note. There is a hint of cherry-ish almond and perhaps some faint orange blossom, but in general, the scent is soft leather dominant. As I do enjoy a leather forward scent, this is in my wheelhouse. This is not approved for use by Mrs. Ruds, however. Strength of scent is mid-strong both off the container and once lathered. Similar scents from the wet shaving environment are:  Chatillon Lux /Declaration Grooming Gratiot League Square and Talbot Shaving /Catie's Bubbles Lantern Hill. \n\nMammoth Soap utilizes a tallow and duck fat soap base. The ingredients are listed as: stearic acid, water, beef tallow, duck fat, kokum butter, glycerin, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, murumuru butter, argan oil, lanolin, sodium lactate, tocopherol. The soap is of mid firmness and load very easily into your brush. The base can take a lot of water but doesn’t demand anymore than would be expected from an animal fat based soap. The lather structure is much like cool whip when dialed in. It has high volume and average density to it. The slickness stands with many good animal fat soaps both in terms of primary and secondary slickness. Post shave is luxurious and is the star of this base. Given the overall performance of this soap base, Mammoth Soaps receives a ShaveScore of 89. Soaps with similar performance are Chiseled Face and Mickey Lee Soapworks. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,  sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Mammoth Soap Almond Leather (purchased)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers Scorpion w/ Declaration B6 (purchased)\n* Razor - Martinez Blades Bullmastiff (purchased)\n* Post - English Leather (purchased)",

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

([https://www.stirlingsoap.com/](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/)) is a veteran owned artisan founded in January, 2012 by owners, Roderick and Amanda Lovan. The company is focused on high quality offerings for budget friendly prices with regards to grooming and accouterments. They also focus on staying environmentally conscious with their product making processes. Stirling Soap Co.’s offerings can be purchased direct or at third party resellers like Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nHot Apple Cider is a fall seasonal featuring notes of apples, cinnamon, and clove. The company advises; “PLEASE NOTE: Our Hot Apple Cider scent HAS CINNAMON, so if you have/may have sensitivities/allergies to cinnamon, please do not purchase from this line.” The scent is extremely real and smells exactly like mulled apple cider that is common and quite popular in the cooler months and as apples are harvested. Scent strength is strong, both off the container and once lathered and shaved with. Similar scents from the wet shaving world are: Oleo Soapworks   \nOld Orchard Cider and Black Ship Grooming Wassail. \n\nStirling Soap Co. employs a solid tallow soap base. Many consider this the gold standard tallow base in terms of performance to price ratio. Ingredients are listed as: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate. The soap is in the middle of the firmness spectrum and is thirsty. The lather created with proper hydration will be the consistency of Greek yogurt. Slickness is very good, bordering on elitist level in both the primary and secondary slickness aspects. Post shave is very good, as can be expected based on the ingredients used in the process. Overall this soap base receives a shavescore of 88. Soap bases with a similar performance are Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements and Storybook Soapworks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Stirling Soap Co.

    "body": "The concept of \"protein overload\" in hair is not present in the scientific literature and its existence is controversial. The purported symptoms of protein overload are usually hair that is:\n\n* Dry\n* Coarse\n* Brittle\n* Won't hold a curl\n* Prone to breakage\n\nNow I got a very old (1999) book from the library called Conditioning Agents for Skin and Hair, edited by Randy Schueller and Perry Romanowski, the original hosts of the Beauty Brains podcast (and Perry still is a host). It's actually [available online](https://askmags.com/conditioning-agents-for-hair-and-skin/) but it's very poorly formatted and missing a lot of pictures (though very helpful that I can paste text from it and not have to try to transcribe from a book that's literally falling apart because it's so old ... like me JKLOL)\n\nOne item in the Humectants in Personal Care Formulation: A Practical Guide (BW Gesslein) caught my eye (emphasis mine):\n\n>Many materials have been claimed to be humectants based on their water- absorbing characteristics when evaluated empirically. Among the many are the collagens, both tropocollagen and the hydrolysates, the keratins, glucose ethers and esters, and various mixtures of materials of botanical nature. In 1980 Deshpande, Ward, Kennon, and Cutie published work done in evaluating these humectants against the known classical materials such as glycerin and sodium lactate (15). In these studies, materials were evaluated in vitro at several humidity conditions ranging from a relative humidity of 20% to one of 90%. **At all humidity conditions, the proteins and derivative exhibited poor results and in fact, at relative humidities of 79% or below, they had negative results.** The glucose ethers and esters gave good results, as did the lactates and lactylates. It must be noted that at 20% relative humidity, no humectant was found to be effective in this study.\n\nThe citation is to industry research that's not publicly available unfortunately.\n\nWe do know that humectants can dry out, and that when they dry out they can make the hair feel brittle and coarse. It leads me to wonder if \"protein overload\" is just dried out humectants, if products are poorly formulated (added film formers, emolliants etc. to help humectants not dry out) or people are not conditioning enough. That would also explain why conditioning is considered a \"cure\" for protein overload.\n\nInterestingly an earlier chapter (Biology of the Hair and Skin by Draelos) also says the protein should wash out of hair easily, but then a later chapter Proteins for Conditioning Hair and Skin  by Neudahl says that protein substansitivity (basically ability to stick on stuff and resist coming off) varies, especially with damaged hair. \n\n>Testing also affirmed that substantial quantities of at least some hydrolyzates penetrated through the cuticle (hair’s outermost, shinglelike protective layer) into the cortex (the fibrillar, main structural component) and that the amount of hydrolyzate bound increased markedly with increasing damage (virgin < bleached <\\*: bleached and waved) (12).\n\nAnd even more so when modified to be cationic (positive charge, to grossly simplify hair usually has negative charge and opposite attract)\n\n>Reaction of fatty tertiary amines with primary amino groups attached these moieties to the hydrolyzate. A quaternary nitrogen atom resulted, imparting cationic character to the hydrolyzate, which was maintained at high pH (> 11). These condensates were thus more substantive to hair and skin than the unmodified hydrolyzates and imparted conditioning benefits to hair and skin.\n\nSo this leads me to wonder if another possible mechanism for \"protein overload\" is that these proteins can build up, but this is not mentioned as a concern in this chapter (most of the stuff about buildup in the book is about \"quats\" like polyquats which is funny because people tend to be most worried about silicones...which seem less likely to build up).\n\nFull disclosure I am not a chemist but I do have a background in food science through my agricultural sciences degree.   \n\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts, more recent research, or experience, I'd love to discuss this!",

        "body": "Thanks for doing a deep dive into the literature for this :) \n\n>or people are not conditioning enough. That would also explain why conditioning is considered a \"cure\" for protein overload.\n\nI've seen a few cosmetic chemists make statements along these lines; that if the hair isn't well conditioned, the existing damage will make the hair brittle, as that is how damaged hair behaves.  Basically the conditioner is not sufficiently masking the damage.  Using a \"moisturizing\" shampoo (i.e. a shampoo without proteins) allows the hair to be conditioned more deeply without proteins that would rinse out immediately, essentially diluting the conditioning potential of the product.\n\nI don't really have enough scientific training to interpret this stuff either, even less than you do, but I explained in more depth my understanding of this phenomenon that many people refer to as Protein Overload based on what I have gleaned from various cosmetic chemists discussing the topic here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1hx33ne/comment/m6ei1ss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1hx33ne/comment/m6ei1ss/)  \n\nI have to imagine that the molecular size and shape of the protein molecules will influence their ability to enter the cortex, which varies greatly.  And if it can get into the cortex, is there evidence that it's helpful?  How does it interact with the protein in the hair?   Or would they be more beneficial if they adsorbed to the surface of the cuticle?  Or does it depend on the protein type?\n\nRegarding the text you quoted about modifying them to be cationic, it seems to indicate that they are able to get a hydrolyzate (hydrolyzed protein?) to be cationic and stay that way at a pH of 11, which is quite high!!   It's not a good idea to expose hair to something that high for long.  Perhaps this approach is used for chemical treatments that expose the hair to extreme alkaline conditions for short periods of time, but I don't know if it has a practical application for topical cosmetic products.  Granted, that was written many years ago, perhaps chemists have found a way to formulate products with cationic hydrolyzed proteins without requiring the product to have such a high pH.\n\nIf you haven't looked through the Journal of Cosmetic Science archive (linked in the sidebar), there are lots of back issues available there to dig into :)   There's also [this 2012 book](https://library.triprinceton.org/1t0nsnb/) from Tri Princeton which is available online for free. Chapters 3 (Shampoo and Conditioner Science) and 10 (Adsorption Properties of Hair) may be helpful to this investigation. \n\nPerry Romanowski also runs another site that's aimed at cosmetic chemists that might have some good info about this as well: [https://chemistscorner.com/](https://chemistscorner.com/)",

The artisan, Heather Melton is a certified Cosmetic formulator through the Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild. The artisan’s focus is on nurturing your skin through the use of vitamins and minerals proven in skin health. The Zingari Man line offers shaving soap, post shave, beard care and skin care for a complete grooming experience. This set offering is a limited edition set that benefits [http://soldierdogs.org/](http://soldierdogs.org/), a charity who assist vets with their needs in having service animals trained for our U.S. Veterans. Zingari Man products can be purchased direct from their website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tribe is a smooth, masculine scent featuring notes of Sandalwood, Amber, light musk, spices, and leather. This scent is well blended and opens soft and creamy with sandalwood. The musk and amber add complexity with the leather and spices being faint supporters. Mrs. Ruds is neutral regarding the scent. She neither loves it nor dislikes it, which these days, I consider a win. Strength of scent is light both out of the container and remains that way once lather is built. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Dr. Jon's Conquest as a comparable scent profile.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nZingari Man has been hard at work improving their vegan based formula. The current vegan base features ingredients of: Stearic Acid, Water, Shea butter, Vegetable glycerin, Potassium hydroxide, Palm oil, Kokum butter, Coconut oil, Castor oil, Sodium hydroxide, Oat oil, Jojoba, Fragrance, Coconut milk and Sodium lactate. The improved base still loads effortlessly into the brush. The level of hydration necessary to build a great lather is now higher. I would consider this a thirsty vegan base. When dialed in, the soap will resemble cool whip, having great density and a slight sheen. Slickness is improved over the previous base. Both primary and residual slickness are excellent. Post shave is the most noticeable of improvements. This post shave is in the elite class regardless of base type. The revised base from Zingari Man is much better than previous iterations and the performance improvements are very tangible. Given my experience with the Zingari Man base, the new ShaveScore comes in at a 94. Soaps with similar perofrmance are: Noble Otter and Tallow + Steel.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Zingari Man The Tribe (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Tusk” (purchased)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - Zingari Man The Tribe (loaner)",

(https://groomatorium.com/) recently release a new line of soaps and aftershaves to compliment their Chiseled Face line as well as their production of the new LA Shaving Soap and Tiki Bar Soaps. This soap line up is called Stubble Buster (https://stubblebuster.com/). The company aims to offering familiar scents with soap that performs amazingly at a very low cost. Soaps are all USD $8.99 for 4 oz of soap and the aftershave line up is USD $9.99 for 3.4 oz. The site offers free shipping on orders over USD $20.00. That represents an amazing deal in the wet shaving space.\n\nBurnish is a citrus forward scent compliments by familiar earth tones. The scent notes are listed as: lemon, neroli, pineapple, rosemary, bergamot, cyclamen, coriander, jasmine, oakmoss, sandalwood, tonka bean, musk, oakmoss, cedar, brazilian rosewood and cardamom. For me, the scent opens with bergamot and lemon, but they are not overly sharp. The scent becomes rounded by the powdery oakmoss and creamy sandalwood. I detect some woodiness and some smokiness, likely from the cedar. Scent strength off the container is mid and remains unchanged during the lather and shave. Similar scented soap recommendations are: Bufflehead Soap Co. Tishomingo or Oleo Soapworks Fiera.\n\nStubble Buster utilizes a tallow based soap formula. The soap ~~is very soft~~  is softer than Chiseled Face's formula by design and it loads into any knot type with little to no effort. The soap is not thirsty, a little water goes a long way with this one. The dialed in lather is reminiscent of whipped cream. This is one crazy creamy lather with both density and volume. The slickness on this soap is very good, both primary slickness and residual slickness. The post shave is also good. Ingredients are listed as: Potassium Tallowate, Glycerin, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Ricinoleate, Potassium Soybeanate, Petrolatum, Aqua, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Olivate, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Cera Alba (beeswax), Tetrasodium EDTA. I cannot think of a soap that performs this well at this price point. This is truly a soap that punches well above, its price point. The shavescore for this Stubble Buster soap base is an 88. This puts the soap in the class of soaps such as Storybook Soapworks and Summer Break Soaps.   \n\n---\n**Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap -  ​Stubble Buster Burnish (purchased)\n\n* Brush - ​​Wolf Whiskers RCE#43 Juliet (purchased)\n\n* Razor - ​​Filarmonica 13 \"Sub Cero\" (PIF)\n\n* Post - Chiseled Face Natural (purchased) \n",

As with their initial release (Hygee), the soap sold out in minutes. The wet shaving community is showing a lot of enthusiasm for this rookie artisan and the brand. This release supports the cause Restore NYC ([http://www.restorenyc.org](http://www.restorenyc.org/)). This charity focuses on ending sex trafficking in New York and Mammoth Soaps donates $1 per tub sold to fight this cause.\n\nMood Indigo is inspired by Duke Ellington’s blues song. The scent notes are: black pepper, oud, vetiver, blueberry, rum and night sky. The scent is quite mellow, warm and smooth. I get just a hint of the berry note and a touch of the black pepper up front, but overall, they fade and the complex scent smells not of individual notes, but of the inspiration behind the blend. The scent is ideal for multi-seasonal use because of its complexity and I would consider this a multipurpose wear because it is smooth and inoffensive. Scent strength is mid-strong off the tub and remains this way during the shave. While this is quite unique, soaps with some similarities are: Australian Private Reserve Ozymandias and Through the Fire Fine Crafts Judy’s Chevelle.\n\nMammoth Soap utilizes a tallow and duck fat soap base. The ingredients are listed as: stearic acid, water, beef tallow, duck fat, kokum butter, glycerin, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, fragrance, murumuru butter, argan oil, lanolin, sodium lactate, tocopherol. The soap is of mid firmness and load very easily into your brush. The base can take a lot of water but doesn’t demand anymore than would be expected from an animal fat based soap. The lather structure is much like cool whip when dialed in. It has high volume and average density to it. The slickness stands with many good animal fat soaps both in terms of primary and secondary slickness. Post shave is luxurious and is the star of this base. Given the overall performance of this soap base, Mammoth Soaps receives a ShaveScore of 89. Soaps with similar performance are Chiseled Face and Mickey Lee Soapworks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Mammoth Soap Mood Indigo (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Showtime” (purchased)\n* Razor - Rockwell 6C (purchased)\n* Post - Mammoth Soap Mood Indigo (loaner) ",

The formula upgrade was born of a pet project that PAA has outside of the business. According to the write up on the site, the artisan’s tinker with soap in their free time as a hobby and they decided to challenge themselves by dispelling *“The Tallow is Superior Myth”*. They have sourced and added several exotic butters to attempt this challenge. The Doppelgänger Collection is their entry into cloning popular fragrances, much like other artisans have been doing. This new Premium Line retails for $24.95 for a 5oz soap.\n\nDoppelgänger Black Label is a clone of the widely popular men’s fragrance, Christian Dior's Sauvage. The scent is described as *“Fresh, Amber, Spicy and Warm. Aromatic with a hint of citrus, spicy warm, and ultra-masculine.”* It features notes of: Bergamot, Ambroxan, Geranium, Pepper, Lavender, Vetiver and Patchouli. This scent is wonderful and I get why so many people enjoy this men’s cologne. As with nearly all PAA soaps, scent is strong off the container and remains strong once lathered. Similar scents from wet shaving are: Ariana & Evans Monte Carlo and Oleo Soapworks Empire. \n\nThe new base is known as CK-6 in the wet shaving community and according to the website features the addition of Bacuri Butter, Cupuacu Butter and Murumuru Butter. Overall the ingredients are listed as: Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Cocoate, Aqua, Potassium Kokumate, Sodium Lactate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Castorate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoa Butterate, Potassium Avocadoate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Capuacu) Butter, Astrocaryum (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Platonia Insignis (Bacuri) Seed Butter, Parfum \\[Fragrance\\]. The soap is soft and care needs to be taken to not overload your brush because it is also insanely thirsty. The lather explodes with water and when properly dialed in resembles Cool Whip. Slickness is improved, both primary and residual aspects are noticeably better than the regular PAA soap base. Post shave also improves upon the regular PAA base. This soap delivers on it’s promise to bridge the tallow gap, much like Catie’s Bubbles, Wholly Kaw and Grooming Dept have previously done. Considering the improvements, the shavescore for the CK-6 soap base is a 92. Soaps with a similar overall performance are: Wholly Kaw vegan and Noble Otter.  \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,*** \n\n***sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Doppelgänger Premium Line Black Label (gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Honey” (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - Chiseled Face Natural (purchased) ",

([https://www.stirlingsoap.com/](https://www.stirlingsoap.com/)) offered some great cologne inspired scents as part of their Black Friday 2018 promotion. Stirling Soap Co. One is one of those such offerings. The soap and aftershave are inspired by the cologne, Dolce & Gabanna The One. Stirling Soap Co. represents some of the best value in the wet shaving artisan space, offering soap, post shave, preshave, bath bars, brushes and more, all at ridiculously affordable prices. Stirling Soap Co.’s offerings can be purchased direct or at third party resellers like Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nOne is based on Dolce & Gabanna The One and features notes of: bergamot, coriander, basil, cardamom, ginger, neroli, cedar, ambergris and tobacco. I’ve not smelled the cologne this is based on so I cannot confirm the accuracy of the scent. I can tell you that the scent opens with some citrus and snap from the ginger, before being rounded out nicely by the warm tobacco and amber. This is a complex, masculine scent that can be worn for any occasion and is what I would consider a multi-seasonal wear. Scent strength is strong off the sample and remains strong once lathered. \n\nStirling Soap Co. uses a tallow based soap featuring the following ingredients: Beef Tallow, Stearic Acid, Distilled Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Fragrance Oil, Almond Oil, Shea Butter, Coconut Milk, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate. The soap base is in the middle of the firmness spectrum and loads with ease. The soap is thirsty and the lather created with proper hydration will be the consistency of Greek yogurt. Both primary and secondary slickness is very good, bordering on excellent level slickness. Post shave is very good, as can be expected based on the ingredients used in the process. Overall this soap base receives a ShaveScore of 88.

    "body": "Hello and welcome to a very special installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They do still make a cream but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't actually smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* **Oldness:** How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* **Spiciness:** This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* **Lather:** You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* **Shave:** How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* **Post:** How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [Crowne & Crane The Spice](https://i.imgur.com/WCTLYve.jpg)\n\nAnd so we enter (for now) into a strange little corner of Old Spice dupery that I honestly wouldn't have even entered if I had read the description of The Spice before ordering it long ago. Also, if Crowne & Crane hadn't named the soap something pretty inaccurate. Also, also, if I hadn't accidentally picked up a second dupe of the scent recently. Yes, The Spice is not an Old Spice dupe but an Old Spice Limited Edition (LE) dupe.\n\n*Record Scratch. Double Take. Wuuuuuuuh!???*\n\nSo you're asking yourself what the heck is an Old Spice LE. Well, despite what most think, Old Spice has had many scents over the years and almost none of them are riffs or new twists on their original Old Spice scent. Old Spice, the company/brand, made a plethora of scents throughout the history of producing Old Spice that, while all fell in the kind of old fashioned scenting category, had nothing to do with what we think of as Old Spice. Old Spice LE was one of these scents. From the dating I can find online, it was released sometime in the early 90s and stuck around for a chunk of that decade and possibly into the 2000s. It's also possible it was a scent released every couple of years as I can see a few different bottle versions. I don't actually know that much about it, have never smelled the original myself, and the Internet is not actually full of Old Spice product history let alone a defunct aftershave from the early 90s.\n\nWhatever the history, what appears to be consistent is that it came in a clear bottle and was called Limited Edition. It also featured a base of amber, cedar, and woods with supporting notes of cardamom, lavender, moss, and jasmine, and citrus top notes. As you can see, aside from the citrus, it doesn't have all the much in common with Old Spice but that hasn't stopped a fragrance seller from selling a dupe of the discontinued scent for those who may still be looking for it. And so, there are soapers out there who pick this scent up for whatever reason instead of actual Old Spice. Actually, there are only two and Crowne & Crane are the only ones I can find doing it intentionally (more on that in a future review). They're also naming it The Spice, which is a little misleading considering the only spice scent in it is cardamon and given the lavender, citrus, and moss present its clearly intended to be somewhat of a fougère. The Spice, I think we can all agree, is not the name anyone would give a fougère.\n\nSo why then am I even reviewing it? That is like asking why do people climb Everest? Why do athletes push their body to the extremes? Why does the woodchuck chuck wood? If these questions could be answered then perhaps I could answer why I am reviewing this. But they can't be.\n\nCrowne & Crane was founded in 2016 by Karl and Liz, whose last names I can't find so we'll call them Karl Crowne and Liz Crane. Karl was an enthusiast it looks like before going into the ol' soapmaking business and, being founded pre-2020, is officially an ol' timer in the artisan soap industry. Despite that longevity they aren't really all that popular around these parts with u/PhilosphicalZombie and u/loudmusicboy literally being the only two folks who appear to use them regularly if at all. I'd say that's maybe because they're not just a shave soap company but Stirling isn't either so that logic kind of flies out the window. Then again, we're a bunch of grown men and women telling other people how we removed hair from our bodies on a daily basis. Logic means nothing here. \n\nCrowne & Crane have two bases, vegan and tallow. Most of their soaps are in tallow only and that's what The Spice comes in so that's what we're working with here. Of note is a commitment to organic, humanely-raised cows for the beef tallow, which is always a plus in my book (and sustainably sourced palm oil). The soap itself is kind of dry and chalky, not in a bad way and it wasn't hard or falling apart. It's a soft, dry soap, which are not contradictory things. The base is made up of Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Tallowate, Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, Aloe Vera Juice, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Cocoate, Phthalate-Free Fragrance, Potassium Shea Butterate, Sodium Shea Butterate, Kokum Butter, Sodium Lactate, Glycerin, Lanolin, Tussah Silk. Nothing to much to comment on here except I can't stop saying the word tussah over and over in my head. It's a weird word and now it doesn't feel real I've said it so much. Tu... ssah. Tooo suuuhhh...\n\nThe labeling is a nice vintage boat symbol, which, again, is a bit misleading given the LE branding was very much a modern (for the 90s) Old Spice look, not the classic schooner branding of the OG Old Spice. If you weren't paying attention (\\*cough\\* me \\*cough\\*) you might just order this thinking you got an Old Spice dupe and open the lid to find you most assuredly did not. Well, open the lid is a bad description as I bought their 3 oz puck option instead of the 5 oz jar and it came wrapped in paper. 3 oz, by the way, is a great mid-price option that gives you more than a tiny sample but not a full plastic tub. I'd be perfectly happy to have other shaving companies offer this... please... please... there's so much soap under my sink. So... much... soap. \n\n(Sidenote: if you are looking to get their soaps, do it quick as they're going on hiatus during a move in two days!)\n\n**Oldness: 0**\n\nAs a scent not designed to smell like Old Spice this one knocks it out of the park. In fact, it does such a great job not smelling like Old Spice I'd put it up there with some of the greatest scents that don't smell like Old Spice ever made. Have a scent that doesnt's smell like Old Spice that you love? This one smells as much not like Old Spice as that one does! If you're looking for something that doesn't smell like Old Spice but has the word Spice featured in its name and the words \"Old\" and \"Spice\" in the description next to each other than this is the soap for you. \n\n**Spiciness: 3**\n\nThis is actually a pretty solid scent even if its called The Spice but isn't really a spicy scent at all. It's definitely a vintage scent, though, and reminds me a bit of Seaforth! Spiced but not as good. Because of that I'm going to say that it still captures a bit of that classic feel that Old Spice gives you even if its a scent from the 90s, a decade that has yet to fall into the \"classic\" zone and thus still feels like everything from it was cringe (including teenage me). \n\n**Lather: 5**\n\nWhat an absolutely brilliant lather The Spice kicks up. From the moment water hits it turning it into a thick prot-lather to the gloriously shiny conclusion, it's just a pleasure to lather. The soap is super thirsty, which can often lead to some dialing issues but I never had those aside from having to add a lot of water to both my larger scoop shave and my medium scoop. You don't need a lot of soap to get this going big and it's really easy to get there and looks great the entire time. If you were going to make an ad about shave soap -- as we all dream to do -- and needed a pretty lather to build up this would be a great choice.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nThe Spice offers an incredible cushion of soap that can tackle even the most aggressive razor, making it feel barely there on your skin. However, it is, at best, mid-tier on its slickness with limited residual slickness too. As I reduced the amount of soap I used on each shave I figured I'd eventually hit a lather that was both full of cushion and slickness, but even on my final shave with the least amount of lather I wasn't too impressed with the glide provided. There's slickness there, it's not like dragging some sort of pillowy sandpaper over your face or anything but despite the copious amounts of water I added it never truly peaked. \n\n**Post: 2**\n\nThe Spice's Old Spice LE scent isn't exactly complimentary with either my Indian Old Spice for the vintage one. It's not an afront to the nostrils or anything (sometimes I picture what nostrils being afronted would look like and it weird me out) but it ain't great. It probably plays a bit better with the more floraly vintage spice if I was forced to choose one by some deranged wet shaving person forcing people to shave with stuff. The soap also left my skin feeling a little sticky for some reason, like there was a layer of it still on there. That dissipated quickly but it was an odd sensation.\n\n**Final Verdict: 13**\n\nCrowne & Crane might be one of my favorite soaps to lather as it's easy to do, looks fantastic, lathers big, and just drinks up the water. It's just kind of fun working it into a lather and for someone who appreciates the process of wetshaving that's a big deal. The shave doesn't quiet live up to the lather, though, despite some really great cushion. Where it really disappoints is the post shave where it not only still doesn't smell like Old Spice (even if it was never trying to) but also left my face feeling a little icky. No one likes an icky face, just ask <insert person whose face you want to insult here>.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

The team at GN announced their next soap, a collaboration with the fragrance house Zaharoff ([https://www.zaharoff.com/](https://www.zaharoff.com/)). This limited edition offering will be available on ***June 15, 2020 at 8:00AM CT***.  Their current offerings feature shaving soap, pre shave, post shave and beard care. The company’s name signifies the respect among gentlemen and their desire for personal care and quality. Each of their current scent offerings is named for a famous gentleman throughout human history. Gentleman’s Nod products can be sourced direct from their website or at West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Maggard Razors ([https://www.maggardrazors.com/](https://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nZaharoff Signature is a warm and spicy scent. The fragrance consists of: Fresh Cardamom, Lavender,Black Pepper, Juicy Pear, Blue Cypress, Ginger Roots, Blonde Cedar, Temple Oud, Florentine Iris, Pimento Leaves, Fir Balsam, Creamy Sandalwood, Gold Patchouli, Black Amber, Myrrh, Frankincense. As with many well blended fragrances, individual notes are not apparent but the fragrance offers more of a vibe. In this case, the warm, spicy vibe is mascualine and confident. Mrs. Ruds adores this scent for any occasion, including the rare date night wear. Strength of scent is strong off the container and remains strong when lathered. \n\nZaharoff Signature is offered in Gentleman’s Nods Cardinal base. This version is slightly tweaked and improves upon an already wonderful post shave.  Ingredients listed in the formula are: Stearic Acid, Glycerin, Aqua (Water), Butyrospermum parkii (Shea Butter), Tallow (Beef), Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Theobroma grandiflorum (Cupuacu) Butter, Fragrance, Lanolin, Sucrose Cocoate, Methyl Gluceth 10, dl-Panthenol, Lauryl Laurate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Persea gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sodium Lactate, Raw Honey, Goat's Milk, Albumen, Buttermilk, Coconut Milk, Sodium Citrate, Orbignya Oleifera (Babassu) Seed Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Silk Amino Acids, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Bentonite Clay, Sodium Phytate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe) Juice (and) Maltodextrin, Hydroxyethylcellulose. The soap is of mid firmness and loads easily into your desired brush type. The Cardinal base is thirsty and when properly worked will resemble sour cream in terms of lather consistency. Primary and residual slickness of this soap are elite. Much like their other soap bases, post shave is the real star and is among the elite in a crowded soap market. The face feel and protection this lather leaves behind is amazing. Given my experience with the base and the incremental post improvement, Gentleman's Nod Cardinal base receives a ShaveScore of 100. For a similar performance experience I suggest Highland Springs Soap Co.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Zaharoff Signature Collection by Gentleman’s Nod (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Dogwood Handcrafts “Darkness” (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Zaharoff Signature Collection by Gentleman’s Nod (promotional gift)",

Mohammad is the owner/operator and is an absolute soap genius. He uses unique and innovative ingredients to arrive at luxurious lather qualities. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Italian Barber ([https://www.italianbarber.com/](https://www.italianbarber.com/)).\n\nAmare is a tropical scent featuring notes of: Fruits, Coconut, Spices, Florals, Vetiver, Musk Ambrette, Sandalwood, Oakmoss, Woodsy notes, and vanilla. The overall fragrance opens mildly fruity and nutty before a smooth blend of earth tones brings a complexity and sophistication to the scent. Mrs. Ruds loves this scent for any occasion short of date night. She finds it appealing but short of sexy. Strength of scent is mid, both off the tub and once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Stirling Soap Co. Boat Drinks as a similar scent profile.\n\nAmare is offered in the Karios tallow base. The listed ingredients are: Water, Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Castor Oil, Palmitic Acid, Avocado Oil, Glycerin, Cupuacu Butter, Shea Butter, Safflower Oil, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Betaine, IsoStearic Acid, Whey Protein, Goat Milk, Jojoba Oil, Lanolin, Colloidal Oatmeal, Mango Butter, Linoleic Acid, Coconut Milk, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Olive Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Lactate, Sunflower Lecithin, Caprlyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherols, Silk peptides. The soap base is mid firm and loads mindlessly easy into your brush of choice, regardless of fiber type. The base is thirsty, but not extremely thirsty. It is intuitive to dial in and work with. When dialed in, the resulting lather is similar in consistency to cold sour cream. Primary and residual slickness are elite, allowing the razor to glide along unimpeded. Post shave is where this base shines though, the post shave is elite and among the most luxurious and nourishing that I’ve come across. Given the pure luxury experience and metrics, Grooming Dept Karios tallow receives a ShaveScore of 102, the highest ShaveScore to date. For similar performance in a base, I suggest Ariana & Evans.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Amare (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Lutin Brushworks (gift)\n* Razor - Wade & Butcher “Buffalo” (gift)\n* Post - Stirling Soap Co.

You would discover that the average Shave Score is 87.26 and the most commonly assigned Shave Score is 89.

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts (https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/). Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. Desairology is a new addition to the artisans permanent scent line up and will release on June 25, 2019. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDesairology is Southern Witchcrafts’ take on a barbershop scent. Their take on this genre includes scent notes of: sandalwood, musk, oakmoss, citrus, lavender, vanilla, oud, burnt white sage, burnt palo santo and gardenia. In typical Southern Witchcrafts fashion, this is a bold and unique take on the scent genre. The scent begins in a rather traditional manner that you’d expect from a classic powdery barbershop. As it develops and unfolds, Southern Witchcraft’s unique take shows it self. Oud, burnt white sage and burnt Pali santo bring this accord into the darkness in a very nice way. While not traditionally a fan of barbershops scents, I really enjoy this presentation. If you’ve read/watched enough reviews, you’ve probably already guess that this one doesn’t make the Mrs. Ruds approved list. Strength of scent on this offering is strong out of the container and remains this way once lathered. This scent is too unique to offer any comparatives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The base’s ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Desairology (purchased)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers Scorpion (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Gamechanger. 84 (purchased)\n* Post - Southern Witchcrafts Desairology (purchased)",

Mohammad, the proprietor and self proclaimed foodie and road cyclist, has continued to reformulate the soap base in order to provide the best possible wet shaving experience. In 2018, the brand received improved packaging and several variants of the popular vegan soap base, and animal fat soap base. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVeritas is a complex and masculine fragrance that consists of notes of: cocoa, tobacco, leather, cognac, castoreum, tonka bean, osmanthus and patchouli. The scent is rich with an opening of cocoa, tobacco, leather and cognac. The dry down displays the tonka and patchouli backbone that the scent is based on. I am not a huge fan of this scent, I find it fairly muddled and almost thrown together. As you’d expect based on the notes, this scent is also not approved for use by Mrs. Ruds. Strength of scent is mid-strong out of the soap container and stays at this level through the entire shave. Scents that share similar vibes from wet shaving are:  Wholly Kaw Cuero Oscuro and Tallow + Steel Echoes of Rain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrooming Dept’s “lusso” formula is utilized for this soap. The base pays homage to italian style shaving soap bases and are tallow only according to the artisans formula page (https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas). The ingredient list is as follows: Aloe Vera Juice, Cow Milk, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Oil, Beef Tallow, Cupuacu Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Pomegranate Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Beta Sitosterol, Silk Amino Acids, Sunflower Lecithin, Sodium Lactate and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap is soft on the firmness spectrum. It loads with little effort into your brush fibers regardless of type. This soap is very thirsty, among the thirstiest soaps I’ve used much like the previous review of both “primus tallow” formula and “janus tallow” formula. When dial in, the lather is a mid structure lather with the consistency of creme fraiche . Slickness stands with the elite class soap bases with regards to both primary and secondary slickness. The post shave also takes its place among the standout elites. Given the overall experience with this luxurious soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 96. Similar performing soaps are Declaration Icarus and Arianna & Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Veritas (loaner)\n* Brush - Maseto Shaving 30mm 2 Band (purchased)\n* Razor - Corvette 1965 (gift)\n* Post - Ariana & Evans Signature (purchased)",

This one has been in the making since October 2019. Known as Cannabliss, this scent continues in the A&E tradition of bold, unique fragrances. Ariana & Evans is the retail arm of the Shaving Shop Online, which also features The Club brand. Ariana & Evans is one of the most popular artisans across the entirety of the wet shaving community. They just happen to be my 2019 artisan of the year as well. Ariana & Evans is available directly, and also at a huge list of stockists which can be found here - [https://aegrooming.com/pages/stocklist](https://aegrooming.com/pages/stocklist). \n\nCannabliss Santal is an intoxicating fragrance that centers around sandalwood and jazz cabbage (you know what I mean!). Scent notes are listed as; Cannabliss, incense, sandalwood, rum, patchouli and rose. The scent opens smooth and creamy from a well balance sandalwood before a bit of dank moves into the accord. The additional notes are supportive and only help to aid in the intoxicating nature of this fragrance. Needless to say, I absolutely love this scent. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one and it has been approved for casual wearing. Strength of scent is strong off the puck and remains this way throughout the shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends RazoRock - The Dead Sea as a similar scent profile. \n\nThis offering is offered in the latest updated A&E soap base (v1.1). The ingredients remain unchanged from the original,  although the ratios have been tweaked to make the lather more dense and more slick. Ingredients are listed as: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Shea Butter, Potassium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Mango Butter, Glycerin, Cocoa Butter, Castor Oil, Manteca (Pig Fat), Strangisto Giaourti (strained yogurt), Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Camellia Oil from Japan, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Agave, Bentonite Clay, Beeswax, Sodium Lactate, Argan Oil, Fragrance & EO's. This is a mid-firm soap base that is of extreme thirst. Water is your friend when dialing in this lather. The resulting lather will have the consistency of elmer’s glue. Slickness is noticeably improved in terms of primary and residual slickness. It is elite in class in terms of slickness. The post shave feels much like the standard A&E soap base, which is elite, and frankly one of the best in the business. A&E v1.1 base receives a ShaveScore of 99. For similar performance in a soap base, I suggest Zingariman Sego. \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Ariana & Evans Cannabliss Santal (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Dogwood Handcrafts Milkglass (purchased)\n* Razor - RazoRock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Catie’s Bubbles Quatre Cent Vingt (purchased)",

This scent was available for purchase at the event and also on WCS website until the supply was diminished. Grooming Dept is well known for pushing the envelope with regards to lather performance with their use of high quality and unique ingredients.In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNYChypre is a blend of hyacinth, lily of the valley, petitgrain, bergamot, rose, galbanum, black currant, melon, mimosa, geranium, black pepper, coriander, musk and precious woods. This fragrance is sweet and floral in the opening before drying down to a musky woody base. Fans of the chypre genre of scent will no doubt want to check this offering out. I am a fan of chypre and as such, I enjoy this soap. Mrs. Ruds however, does not approve, most likely because of the musky, woody dry down. The fragrance emits a mid-strong scent both off the container and once lathered. Similar scents from the wet shaving space are: Catie's Bubbles Mille Chypre and Barrister and Mann Le Grand Chypre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrooming Dept’s “janus tallow” formula is utilized for this soap. The base explores multiple animal fats (beef and lamb tallow) according to the artisans formula page (https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas). The ingredient list is as follows: Aloe Vera Juice, Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goat Milk, Castor Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Lamb Tallow, Camelina Oil, Shea Butter, Fragrance\\*, Marshmallow Extract, Glycerine, Sunflower Lecithin, Grape Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Mango Butter, Coconut Oil, Larch Arabinogalactan, Glucomannan (Konjac root), Silk Peptides, Kaolin Clay, Allantoin, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate, Grape Seed Extract, Chamomile Extract, Green Tea Extract and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap is on the firmer side of the spectrum but loads with little effort into your brush fibers. This soap is very thirsty, among the thirstiest soaps I’ve used much like the previously review “primus tallow” formula. When dial in, the lather is a mid structure lather with the consistency of sour cream. Slickness stands with the elite class soap bases with regards to both primary and secondary slickness, although I find the “primus tallow” slightly slicker. The post shave also takes its place among the standout elites, better than the “primus tallow”. Given the overall experience with this luxurious soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 96. Similar performing soaps are Declaration Icarus and Arianna & Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept NYChypre (loaner)\n* Brush - Simpsons Chubby 2 “Super” (gift)\n* Razor - Dovo “Bismarck” (gift)\n* Post - Barrister’s Reserve Classic (purchased)",

    "body": "Hello and welcome to the 38th installment of The Great Spice Off! What is The Great Spice Off?\n\nI love the scent of Old Spice, so much so that it's the only aftershave I use as I don't really feel a need to splash anything else on. But, as we all know, Old Spice no longer makes shaving soap. They still make a cream, but that's hardly a great soap and it doesn't smell like Old Spice. As such my plan is to test out all the Old Spice options that are out there on as many bases as possible both to try out a variety of bases from different soapmakers and to report back to you on who really nails the scent.\n\nI'll be shaving three times with each soap, using a variety of brushes and razors, and blades. Yes, I know that means it won't be exactly scientific but this is going to take a while and I want to use all my other shit too. Soaps will be rated on a few factors and given points from 1-5 for each.\n\n* Oldness: How much does the soap smell like OG Old Spice. This is the more analytical scent analysis and I'm comparing to an OG Old Spice aftershave I have and the Shulton aftershave from India.\n* Spiciness: This is the je ne sais quois of Old Spice. Does the soap make me feel the nostalgia, warmth, and whatever it is about the scent that works. Is there something special about it that makes it stand out? Does it invoke a memory or make a new one? The most subjective of this list.\n* Lather: You know, can I make a shave soap out of it.\n* Shave: How's it work on the ol' face while shaving.\n* Post: How's the scent profile after the event. How does my face feel.\n\n# [MMGP Norse Spice](https://i.imgur.com/nh3l9dO.jpg)\n\nGuess who's back? Back again. Shavies back. Tell a friend.\n\nOoof, that was really forced. Shavies? Really? Guys, I am very rusty here. But that doesn't mean I can't evaluate Old Spice shaving soaps still. I just need to warm up here. Get back into the swing of things. Hit some puns. I am feeling a little stubbly today. I need to get my act razor-straight.\n\nSTILL GOT IT!\n\nToday, we dive into a super special double secret soap that was actually brought to my attention over in the Shave Dad Facebook group, where one of the members alerted me to the fact that MMGP was doing a test run of their first ever tallow base and using Old Spice as the scent. I, of course, had to get in on this, so I emailed one Graham Murray, owner and operator of MMGP, and requested a sample. To my surprise, he did not run away in fear of the Old Spice-obsessed madman shouting at him from across the ocean but instead gladly offered up a sample. However, MMGP is located in Scotland, and I am located in not Scotland by a very great distance, meaning shipping costs were astronomical for a single sample or even a single puck with a sample (and this was pre-tariffs). However, through a complex system of gears and pulleys (and the help of the very awesome person who mentioned it to me in the Shave Dad community), I was eventually able to get a large sample mailed to me without the massive cost of mailing things across the ocean. Anyway, it landed a week or so ago in tip-top shape, and TGSO was born again... or never died? Can you kill that which never dies?\n\nOf course, that does seem to render the point of this review somewhat moot if you can't get your hands on it yourself, but... fear not! Norse Spice, in MMGP's new tallow base, will be coming to the storefront itself at some point in the future if everything goes as planned. Hurray. Wasting 20ish minutes reading this is now not a complete waste of time!\n\nMMGP stands for Mr. Murray's Grooming Products, which gives the brand a sort of old-school apothecary feel when spelled out -- as if he's rolling into town hawking his incredible shave wares guaranteed to spruce up your face and entice the feminine wiles. It's a relatively new brand that launched last year after the family left Russia to escape the war. The business is a family-run one that launched from his passion for wet shaving. MMPG runs two concurrent kinds of shaving line brands. The first is branded under the Mr. Fox mascot, with a kind of art deco classic film style inspired by the likes of Cary Grant and Sean Connery (as a Bond fan, I approve). Surprisingly, there's no mention of one Fantastic Mr. Fox, who is also a stylish guy. The second, which I assume Norse Spice will fall into, is a collection of soaps under the Asgard Casino label, which feature scents inspired by the Norse gods.\n\nHere is where I'd usually offer up some commentary on the scent description, but since this is a test sample of his new base, there isn't one for either the scent or the base. However, this is, as far as I've been told, a direct dupe of Old Spice. The base is his first attempt at tallow, having gone vegan to start, and is a middle-of-the-road softness that has the normal shade of soap (Do you ever pause to consider how your life brought you to a place like typing the phrase \"normal shade of soap?). Mr. Murray himself was kind enough to send along the ingredients list despite it not being published anywhere else. That's right, a TGSO exclusive! Remember where you are so you can remember where you were when you first read the list of ingredients in MMGP's tallow base.\n\nThey are: Stearic Acid, Water, Adeps Bovis (Beef Tallow), Potassium Hydroxide, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut Oil), Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ricinus Communis (Castor Oil), Elaeis Guineensis Fruit Oil (Palm Oil), Fragrance, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Grandiflorum (Cupuacu) Seed, Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed (Jojoba) Oil, Garcinia Indica (Kokum) Seed, Butter, Astrocaryum Murumuru (Murumuru) Seed Butter, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Coumarin, Eugenol, Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, Isoeugenol, Limonene. Being a UK brand, where beauty and wellness products actually have regulations, there are a few ingredients you don't usually see listed out at the end there but overall a mix of stuff you see pretty often in soap bases outside of the Cupuacu Seed oil, which Google tells me is akin to cocoa. Thus, we're clearly shaving with chocolate here and making this soap an obvious gormound... that was a joke, it's not.\n\nThe base, by the way, is unnamed! As I have successfully named two unnamed bases already, I am fresh out of ideas and will leave it up to the rest of you to name this one.\n\nAnd here is where I usually comment on the label design, but since there is none yet, I can't. Instead, I'll just say I'm kind of sad this isn't falling into the Mr. Fox line because I like those labels better, given my penchant for James Bondian style, and I feel like Old Spice and the debonoir charm of those classic actors go hand in hand. I'll also give Mr. Murray props for not using AI label designs (though it's getting harder and harder to tell) while still having individual artwork for each of his soaps and also having a cohesive brand look. That is, evidently, somewhat challenging to do in the world of wet shaving.\n\n**Oldness: 3**\n\nNorse Spice is 100% an Old Spice dupe, which one feels shouldn't be a very high bar, but I've opened enough pucks of \"Old Spice\" soaps that smell like the soapmaker had never even walked past a person wearing Old Spice that I can tell you it is. This is a solid dupe, though I find on the puck the base notes are all you can really pick up, leaving the citrus and floral notes behind and mostly presenting the vanilla, tonka, musk, and cedar. The rest of the scents come out to play a bit on the lather, and it still delivers that nostalgic kick, but it's not quite at perfection.\n\n**Spiciness: 3**\n\nAn increasingly rare correlation (not causation?) between oldness and spiciness. This dupe is definitely OG Old Spice. It's definitely something I enjoy smelling. It definitely smells like Old Spice, especially when lathered. Something about looking like a duck... However, it's not doing anything special with the scent (something I've increasingly come to appreciate over the course of this series), nor is it top-tier duping. For those less obsessed with Old Spice (everyone), this probably easily hits hard. But I'm not everyone. I'm a unique shaving flower.\n\n**Lather: 3**\n\nMMGP's tallow base has one of the weirdest lather experiences I've encountered, somewhat akin to  Mystic Water's. Its proto-lather is basically that fish from Finding Nemo: bubbles. bubbles. bubbles. Nothing but air and bubbles right off the bat, leading me to think that each time I started lathering I was going to get something really thin. However, upon the addition of more water and more work it kicks up into some pretty damn nice soap. It's a bit tricky to dial in because of this unique lather build, but it's never hard to get it up into at least a decent lather. I, honestly, kind of enjoyed a lather that kicked up differently from what I'm used to as it made the lathering something different.\n\n**Shave: 3**\n\nNotch this up to a 4 if you get the lather right, which probably would be a consistent thing once I got used to the process. Norce Spice absolutely excels at slickness, making all three of my razors glide easily over my face with the ease of a greased-up frozen turkey sliding across ice, but all those bubbles at the start of the lather can lead to a bit of a thinner lather and less cushion overall. With the right dialing in, you can pull a solid cushion out of the soap, but it takes a bit of work. Still, no matter what I did, it was slick AF, and its residual slickness carried on like a small, greased-up child chasing after his frozen turkey.\n\n**Post: 4**\n\nI don't think the MMGP base is doing anything out of this world for my skin, but it also didn't dry it out either, so that's great. What it does do is play wonderfully with both OG Old Spice aftershave and the modern Indian one. Directly post shave, the heavy base notes combined with both aftershave to make an almost unique take on Old Spice, and it was decadent... which is an adjective usually reserved for gourmands so... maybe it is one! (It's not; that's still a joke.)\n\n**Final Verdict: 16**\n\nFor a first shot at a tallow base, Norse Spice is an incredibly good foundation to build on, with an Old Spice dupe that gets the job done, if not delivering that perfect old-school hit of shaving nostalgia. The lather may build strangely, but the end result is always big and foamy, which is what really matters. With incredible slickness, there are fantastic shaves to be had with this soap, but what really stood out for me was the post-shave, which delivered wonderful, lasting scent mixtures with my aftershave. MMGP's Bill Murray base (I figured a name out; every base should be named after a famous Murray) is definitely a strong start, and kicking it off with Old Spice is, obviously, the best decision ever made in the history of shaving.\n\n**Previous Great Spice Offs:**\n\n1.

Base ingredients comparison is as follows: \n\nOld- Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Water, Glycerine, Coconut Milk, Potassium Hydroxide, Palm Kernel Flakes, Sodium Hydroxide, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Castor Oil, Shea Butter, Myristyl Myristate, Safflower Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tussah Silk.\n\nNew- Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Water, Glycerine, Coconut Milk, Aloe Juice, Potassium Hydroxide, Babassu Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Castor Oil, Shea Butter, Myristyl Myristate, Sweet Almond Oil, Hemp Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Tussah Silk.\n\nI wanted to shave with this new soap 3 times so that I could fully enjoy this soap and absorb what it has to offer. To me, loading this base into the brush is a bit different. Just to preface, I face lather. I didnt try to bowl lather, because I just went with whats natural to me. Back to loading, this soap is a bit softer than the other two Oz Soaps that I have which are in the old base. And when I say a bit, I mean a little bit. You can still load it like you hate it and youll be fine, but anything over 10 seconds is possibly overkill.\n\nThe lathering process was the same. To me, it takes a good bit of water. What I like to do is get the lather all sticky when I first put it on my face and then add water as I go via making a divot in the brush and putting water in the brush. Essentially, I turn my brush into a cup and apply the water directly to my face. I normally do this twice before the first pass, and once when I relather for the second pass and it works out perfect.\n\nWhen lathered properly, the soap makes copious amounts of thick, rich, dense, shiny lather, and in comparison to the old base, it is a tad bit congealed? Stringy? I think those are the words im looking for. The Xanthan Gum is noticeable.\n\nOnto the scent. For me, the scent is a winner. Hands down, hands up, left or right. When I did the review for JPH some time ago, I remember saying that the scent strength wasnt that strong. That has been remedied, and it is a strong scent.  The Dried leaves is what I pick up in the most because its a reminiscent scent. I remember raking leaves in the Fall growing up, so it sticks with me. I can pick out the Rose and Lemon as well.\n\nThe Scent Profile is as follows:\n\nA deep dark base of Oakmoss and Amber, with a small hint of Patchouli.  The mid notes contain Neroli, rose and dried leaves and the top notes blend bergamot with lemon.\n\nWhen its all said and done, to me, this soap is a Winner. From the art, to the base, to the scent, to the post shave...its a Winner.\n\nThese thoughts are mine and mine alone, as I bought the Soap and AS Splash. Take care y'all.",

    "body": "[Video Up](https://youtu.be/svIKgI0nV48)\n\nCooper & French ([https://shop.cooperandfrench.com/](https://shop.cooperandfrench.com/)) is a Minneapolis, MN based artisan that’s been making artisan shave soap, aftershave balm and bath soap since Fall 2016. The artisan recently released their highly popular, limited edition (for Winter) Santa’s Workshop soap and aftershave balm. This veteran owned small business is head up by Richard and Stephanie, who have a keen focus on customer service and enjoy all things antique and vintage. You may recall my review of their goat milk soap base from the past ([https://youtu.be/DrKtbkGLz2w](https://youtu.be/DrKtbkGLz2w)). Cooper & French is available from their site and also from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nCooper & French Santa's Workshop features notes of damask rose, geranium, sweet orange, honey, vanilla, patchouli, honeyed pipe tobacco and leather. The scent is fitting for the season it is intended to mimic. The entire accord is warm and inviting with notes of pipe tobacco, vanilla and patchouli serving as a base with compliments of orange, floral and a touch of leather. The scent is light to mid off the container and remains that way through the lather and shave. Scent in a similar vein to this are: Siliski Soaps Santa's Pipe and Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements Briar.\n\nCooper & French’s tallow soap base hangs with the wide majority of tallow soaps in the market. Ingredients include: Distilled Water, Potassium Stearate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Stearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Glycerin, Fragrance, Sodium Lactate. This soap base is firm, but with a damp brush, it loads easily into your preferred hair type. The soap is not overly thirsty and it creates a thick, creamy lather with little thought. The volume and density of the soap is closer to greek yogurt than cool whip. It provides good slickness and very good residual slickness. The post shave feel is good. While I slightly prefer the goat milk/tallow version, this one is not lacking in any way. The soap base experience provides a shavescore of 86. This is same experience I get with Turtleship Shave Soap and Siliski Soaps.\n\n*Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Soap - Cooper & French Santa's Workshop (gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Burnt” (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Razors Vector (gift)\n* Post - Cooper & French Santa's Workshop (gift)",

Mohammad, the proprietor and self proclaimed foodie and road cyclist, has continued to reformulate the soap base in order to provide the best possible wet shaving experience. In 2018, the brand received improved packaging and several variants of the popular vegan soap base, and animal fat soap base. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJasmine & Civet is a floral forward scent with a musk bottom. Scent notes feature: Jasmine, mimosa, myrrh, incense, civet and rose. This scent is sure to be polarizing because the prominent smells of both floral and animalic musk. To my nose, the jasmine and rose open strong but are quickly ground by the pungent animalic musk from the civet. The scent is a casual user based on it’s profile and polarizing nature. I would consider this scent multi seasonal because floral forward scents are seasonal neutral. Scent strength off the container is is strong and moves towards mid-strong as the lather is built. Scents with similar vibes are: Australian Private Reserve Mycroft and Dr. Jon's 13.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrooming Dept’s “lusso” formula is utilized for this soap. The base pays homage to italian style shaving soap bases and are tallow only according to the artisans formula page ([https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas](https://www.groomingdept.com/pages/formulas)). The ingredient list is as follows: Aloe Vera Juice, Cow Milk, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Coconut Oil, Beef Tallow, Cupuacu Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Pomegranate Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Beta Sitosterol, Silk Amino Acids, Sunflower Lecithin, Sodium Lactate and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap is soft on the firmness spectrum. It loads with little effort into your brush fibers regardless of type. This soap is very thirsty, among the thirstiest soaps I’ve used much like the previous review of both “primus tallow” formula and “janus tallow” formula. When dial in, the lather is a mid structure lather with the consistency of creme fraiche . Slickness stands with the elite class soap bases with regards to both primary and secondary slickness. The post shave also takes its place among the standout elites. Given the overall experience with this luxurious soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 96. Similar performing soaps are Declaration Icarus and Arianna & Evans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Jasmine & Civet (gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Tusk”  (purchased)\n* Razor - Rex Supply Co.

The brand began in 2017 and is owned by Courtney Brooks and Stephen Joiner. Joiner, is also the owner of the artisan brush company, Dogwood Handcrafts ([https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/](https://dogwoodhandcrafts.com/)). This offering was released on May 11, 2019 and is part of a series created for the subreddit, r/wetshaving and is based on the American novel, The Great Gatsby. Southern Witchcrafts focus is on providing high quality vegan shaving products with scents that are interesting and unique. In addition to ordering direct, Southern Witchcrafts can be purchased at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nValley of Ashes is a complex fragrance built with scent notes of:  Coal, Tar, Bourbon, Tobacco, Bitter Citrus, Smoke, Leather, Motor Oil, Burning Rubber, Diesel, Clove, Birch Tar and Bergamot. This scent intends to represent it’s namesake from the novel, where industrial factories emmite ashes from their coal fuel and the entire area is ripe with a gloomy, desperate overtone. The fragrance accomplishes this and opens with a sweet, metallic motor oil note that is quickly met by tar, coal and burnt rubber. The fragrance is rounded out by hints of citrus and clove, which lends to more palatability. While the scent is not my jam, I appreciate it for the complexity and the very real picture it creates. Mrs. Ruds does not approve of this scent and if I am to use it, I will find myself on the couch. This is a mid-strong scented fragrance and similar offerings from wet shaving are: Chiseled Face Groomatorium Midnight Stag and Talbot Shaving Double Trouble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSouthern Witchcrafts uses a soap base of the vegan variety. The bases ingredients are listed as: Water, stearic acid, shea butter, castor oil, potassium hydroxide, glycerine, coconut oil, sodium lactate, sodium hydroxide, jojoba oil, aloe powder, liquid aloe, isopropyl myristate, kaolin clay and fragrance. The soap is soft to mid on the firmness spectrum. The soap base loads easily and lathers with very little effort. It is of normal thirst and whips into a lather that will have the consistency of cool whip. The slickness of this soap is excellent in both the visible slickness area as well as a secondary slickness. Post shave, like slickness is excellent as well. The oils and butters provide a luxurious feeling on the skin post shave. Given my experience with this soap base, it receives a ShaveScore of 92. Soap bases with similar performance are: Phoenix Artisan Accoutrements (CK-6) and Wholly Kaw (vegan). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Southern Witchcrafts Valley of Ashes (PIF)\n* Brush - Mozingo Brushworks “Dark Side” (purchased)\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - The Club Signature (purchased)",

Elegant Emerald | SynBad 24mm**\n\n**The New Improved Schick Injector Razor | Personna 74**\n\nGrooming Dept hadn't been high on my list of soaps to try because---agree or not---soaps that have matching splashes are more attractive to me.  Certainly, this self-imposed restriction has resulted in my missing out on a few good soaps.  When you pair that with the relatively scant availability of Grooming Dept products, it was unlikely I would be picking up a tub anytime soon.  West Coast Shaving changed that.  The readily available stock, free shipping, and ease of ordering made the $23 for 4 oz. price tag a bit more palatable.  I ordered *After The Fire* from WCS, and then I commented on a Grooming Dept Instagram post indicating I'd made my first purchase of one of their soaps.  Soon after my post, Grooming Dept contacted me via direct message and asked which soap I ordered.  Then they offered to send me a tub of *Earl Grey Gelato* in their *Mallard* soap base.  I was initially hesitant to accept the generous offer as I try to avoid making a habit of using free products and then touting their wonderful qualities.  That said, Grooming Dept never once asked me to speak publicly about my experience but rather seemed genuinely interested in hearing my feedback directly, thus an exception was made.\n\nIn addition to the usual suspects, the highlights of ingredients in the Mallard base include duck fat, goat milk, babassu oil, cupuacu butter, kokum butter, meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil, and kaolin clay (I'll include the unabridged list following this writing).  That's an impressive list, and as such has the potential to be a good soap.  Absent any data to support my theory, I suspect the source of tallow used has less to do with the product's performance than do the ratios and technique employed by the artisan, so I've wondered if the recent surge in duck fat bases hasn't been overplayed.  Regardless, upon first use, Grooming Dept has me.\n\nThe dry product in the tub looks like formed rubber and is a light sandstone color. I honestly expected it to return to its form after pressing in with my thumb, but the appearance is deceptive, and it acts as many soft soaps leaving a dent with minimal crumbling. With the exception of a couple tiny caverns made by escaping bubbles, the surface is smooth and solid in appearance and has retracted from the wall of the tub as it cures.  \n\nThe documented scent notes of Earl Grey Gelato are \"Earl Grey Tea, Lemon Gelato, and Waffle Cone\". The fragrance off the tub is one of the lightest I've ever smelled.  I simply could not detect much fragrance at all.  I test lathered the night before and once again proved dry product scent assessments can't be trusted.  A wonderful creamy and slightly sweet lemon fragrance quite boldly filled the bathroom.  As I continued to play with lather, a warm muted vanilla crept in.  The black tea note was also understated but made a late appearance nonetheless.\n\nWhile it's a good practice to test lather a soap that's new to you, this is one of those bases in which I would say it's essential to understanding the limits of the soap.  It has a fair amount of thirst, and much like PAA's CK-6 base, it functions at an adequate level even when it's not optimized.  If you stop there, you may very well miss out on the most important aspect of the base, namely the slickness.  However, the addition of more water transforms it into what it's intended to be.  I found it difficult to drown this lather as it kept accepting more and more water.  If you employ this method, the sweet spot is readily evident and a  creamy, lustrous lather is forthcoming.  It  actually looks as if it will drip off your brush, but it doesn't.  If you'll note in my SOTD picture, there are peaks in the lather.  The only way I could get it to do that was to underwater it.  The second image is an optimized lather.  To borrow a comparison often used by the great /u/dendj55, it looks like room temperature sour cream.\n\nIn real-world use, this lather is nothing short of spectacular.  It's not just a pretty lather but a work horse, providing everything one expects from a top artisanal soap, demonstrating remarkable density, off-the-charts primary slickness as well as equally extraordinary residual slickness. The post shave is among the highest performers as well.  Even for a head-shave, a post product was completely unnecessary, but if you're looking for a scent complement, Catie's Bubbles' Confiant would pair nicely and pulls this out of gourmand territory.  Alternatively, for the Earl Grey push, Barrister and Mann's Cheshire would do in a pinch.  For evaluation purposes, I skipped a post product and have no regrets.\n\nIn my opinion, Grooming Dept earns a spot among the elite artisans at least in terms of this duck fat base.  While I belabored the need to explore its water limits, it's not a difficult product to lather.  The warm, mellow, lemon-vanilla and black tea fragrance of Earl Grey Gelato is fresh and unique, so I'll be keeping this generous gift from Grooming Dept.  Hopefully, I'll eventually get around to trying my purchased tub of *After The Fire* that utilizes Grooming Dept's \"Special Edition\" base which includes beef tallow in addition to duck fat.\n\n**Ingredients:** *Stearic Acid, Aloe Vera, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Duck Fat, Babassu Oil, Castor Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Kokum Butter, Meadowfoam Oil, Jojoba Oil, Abyssinian Oil, Fragrance, Silk Peptides, Glycerin, Sunflower Lecithin, Goat Milk, Sucrose Cocoate, Carnauba wax, Kaolin Clay, Calendula Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate and Vitamin E.*",

The scent is very comforting, like a dessert you'd share with your S/O at a cozy little Italian joint. I am still impressed with just how much water the soap can handle, I feel like you could build up the soap with more and more water for *ages* before it starts to break the lather. The slickness is most impressive, and don't feel like I need to use a balm afterwards too. I like to pair this with Barrister's Leviathan aftershave, though Mallards is light and sweet, and Leviathan is dark and musky, I really enjoy the contrast. Also, I really dig the label artwork, was the sole reason I picked this soap to begin with compared to his other offerings haha\n\nThanks for your review!",

    "body": "[Video Up](https://youtu.be/qknXi7mADew) \n\nSiliski Soaps ([http://www.siliskisoaps.com/](http://www.siliskisoaps.com/)) is a fairly new artisan in the U.S. wet shaving space. The company began making soaps, like many artisans, in order to get a healthier and cleaner ingredients list in their everyday soap use. The brand makes shaving soap, pre/post shave, hand soap, body soap and shampoo. The company prides itself on using high quality, natural ingredients and they never use palm products in their soap making process. In addition to purchasing direct from their site, they can also be found at West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nAppalachian Forest is a blend of coniferous and woody scents. Featuring notes of pine, fir and cedarwood, the scent evokes thoughts of walking through an evergreen forest. The blend is complex and the individual notes move in and out with a really nice synergy about them. Fans of woody scents will undoubtedly appreciate this accord. Scent strength is strong both out of the container and remains strong once lathered up. Similar scents from the wet shaving hobby include; Stirling Soap Co. Coniferous and Mike's Natural Soaps Pine & Cedarwood.\n\nSiliski Soaps utilizes a strictly vegan based soap formula. Ingredients are listed as; saponified cocoa butter, kokum butter mango butter, shea butter, castor oil, jojoba oil, palm free stearic acid, essential oils, sodium lactate, tussah silk. The soap is of soft to mid consistency and loads quite easily into the brush fiber of your choosing. The soap is on the thirsty side and rewards the user with a creamy lather that when dialed in resembles whipped cream. The slickness is good. Both visible lather and residual lather are slick and provide ample speed for the edge to glide along without fear. Post shave is good and leaves the skin feeling well moisturized and soft. The resulting shavescore in my experience is an 86. Formulas with a similar presentation are Eleven Soaps and Turtleship Soap. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Siliski Soaps Appalachian Forest (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Ghost” (purchased)\n* Razor - Boker “Elite” (gift)\n* Post - Brut (purchased) ",

Doesn't lather much and does not dry out the skin either. I use it when i need a light cleanse, for example after an oil cleansing balm that emulsifies. I wouldn't recommend using it after a first cleanser like a carrier oil that doesn't emulsify on its own as it it won't be able to remove the oil. Will not recommend it to use to remove sunscreen alone it is really gentle for that. I got it on a 30%+ sale from vanity wagon, hence it was a good deal at that price. While finding out the ingredients list for this post, I realized it has so many fragrance components that a lot of people in this sub wouldn't appreciate, but YMMV I guess?!! (I got it a year ago when I didn't have any skincare knowledge and was attracted to ayurvedic brands. Having said that I don't regret this purchase at all and I still believe SoulTree is one of the better ayurvedic brands. Personally I'm not allergic to fragrance yet, so I don't mind it) It maybe perfect for a gentle morning cleanser too as its the perfect amount of gentle but personally I don't use a cleanser in the morning. It has a pH of 5 as per the website. Haven't tested myself.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status: WRP if I don't find a better alternative (only if it is on sale, I don't believe in spending 600 on a cleanser, the only purpose of which is to clean).",

One of the scent releases is Pedro Fiasco. The Club is a membership based collection of wet shaving products and part of the Shaving Shop Club, which also features the Ariana & Evans brand. Membership costs USD $12.99/6 months and offers its customers exclusive scents, access to the VIP Facebook group as well as a 20% discount on all products and services offered through the online store. If a membership based collection is not your thing, I would still recommend checking out Ariana & Evans. Their offerings are available at these third party retailers; Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/), Smallflower (https://www.smallflower.com/), Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/) and TVB Shaving ([https://tvbshaving.com/](https://tvbshaving.com/)).​\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPedro Fiasco is inspired by Amouage Reflection Man but is not a clone or duplication. The fragrance features notes of rosemary, red pepper, berries, bitter orange leaves, orris, jasmine, ylang ylang, vetiver, patchouli, tobacco absolute, whiskey, sandalwood, cedarwood and musk. The fragrance opens slightly floral and powdery before drying down to the creaminess of sandalwood and a touch of muskiness. This is masculine and balanced and I like this interpretation a lot. Mrs. Ruds approves and says this is a sexy scent that is perfect for date night. Scent strength is strong as The Club is well known for. Wet shaving offerings with a similar vibe are: Storybook Soapworks Shaken and Reef Point Soaps Admiralty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Club uses a tallow and goat milk based soap. Ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Goats Milk, Shea Butter, Strangistó Giaoúrti, Potassium Hydroxide, Kokum Butter, Mango Butter, Cocoa Butter, Manteca (Lard), Glycerin, Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Lanolin, Sodium Hydroxide, Camellia Oil, Bentonite Clay, Beeswax, Sodium Lactate, Argan Oil, Fragrance & EO's.The soap remains on the firmer side of the spectrum and loads effortlessly into your brush fiber of choice and is a very thirsty soap. When dialed in, the lather resembles greek yogurt. The slickness is elite in both primary slickness and residual slickness. Post shave rises above all and provides the best post shave experience I have had to date. The resulting ShaveScore is a 96. Similarly performing soaps are Talbot Shaving and Wholly Kaw (Bufala).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - The Club Pedro Fiasco (PIF)\n* Brush - Mocek \"Green Tea\" w/ 24mm Maggard SHD\n* Razor - Dovo “Best Quality”\n* Post - The Club Pedro Fiasco (PIF)",

Scent notes feature pepper, smoke, oak moss, cardamom, vanilla, birch wood, patchouli and craft stout beer. This scent is a true representation of the stout beer it’s intended to remind you of. The scent notes cannot be easily detected as separate, but rather the fragrance smells of an oatmeal style stout with a semi-sweet vanilla backbone. The scent is a smile time scent that I like but do not love. Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one as well. She’s declared that it’s okay to wear around the house but never out on a date. Strength of scent is strong, as is the motto of Ariana & Evans scents.

        "body": "You didn't do anything wrong. The variation in color is what many soap makers call \"partial gel\" where the center of the soap gets warm enough to go into \"gel\" (a thick vaseline-like liquid) but the edges stay cool enough to not go into gel. \n\nGelling is caused by the heat of saponification, and it's entirely a normal thing. If you want to prevent partial gel, then either encourage the soap to fully gel (my preference) or keep the entire loaf of soap cool enough so it doesn't gel at all.\n\nI went to the Brambleberry listing for the kit and see it includes a recipe that is based on using all the fats in the kit -- over 3 pounds (52 oz / about 1500 g) of fats. Wowser -- that's a big batch of soap to make! \n\nI normally suggest beginning soap makers to make batches with only 16 oz / 500 g of fats. That's also a good idea even for experienced soap makers when making a recipe radically different than what they normally make. That way, if you make a major mistake making the soap or don't like the soap, then you don't have a huge batch of messed-up or unwanted soap to deal with. Also for a beginner, better to practice making 3 small batches than just 1 large batch. \n\nIn any case, the partial gel is completely an esthetic issue; the soap is fine and will be safe to use after it cures.",
