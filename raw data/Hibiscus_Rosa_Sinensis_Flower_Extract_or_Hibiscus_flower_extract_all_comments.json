    "body": "I wash my hands way too often, so I needed a reliable hand cream.\n\nHere’s what I look for when choosing one\n\n1. The scent shouldn’t be overpowering.\n\n2. It should absorb well without leaving a greasy residue.\n\n3. It shouldn’t be too pricey.\n\n**Beyond Classic Hand Cream – Total Recovery**\n\nTexture:  A classic hand cream consistency, neither too thick like an ointment nor too runny. Surprisingly, more fluid hand creams can sometimes feel greasier!\n\nKey Ingredients: Ceramide, Hibiscus flower extract\n\nScent: A light apple floral fragrance with the following notes.\ntop : white florals, middle : powdery, base : musk \n\nWhile writing this review, I found out that the different hand creams in this line aren’t just scented differently, they actually have different formulations! \nI was thinking of getting the green one because I liked the scent, but it turns out it has a different function.\n\nThe Total recovery version is the deep moisture formula in the lineup, but it absorbs quickly without any sticky residue, and the hydration lasts. \nThe scent isn’t too strong, so it doesn’t linger in a way that would bother me. \nSome might find it noticeable, but compared to other hand creams with much stronger fragrances, this one is perfectly fine for me.\n\nThe biggest reason I chose this? It frequently goes on buy one get one sales, so I can always stock up. I actually bought mine during a BOGO deal, finished an entire tube, and now I’m finally writing this review!",

    "body": "Good Skin Days - C’s The Day Serum\n\nIt feels like just a few days ago when I was sitting in on a Zoom call hosted by Charlotte Cho...where she revealed/announced the Good Skin Days line. \n\nI was so happy and excited for her and this next step in the Soko Glam journey. Needless to say, I picked up the three initial product launches as soon as I could and got my hands on the fourth (the Prime Time Cleansing Toner) last week.\n\nBut, I’ll save my thoughts on the new line as a whole for the full brand review. Right now I want to focus on one product (the first that I’ve incorporated into my routine)...the C’s The Day Serum.\n\nWhen Charlotte first brought this serum up during her presentation I thought “Wait, you already have a vitamin c serum...and it’s one of my favorites!” The Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid was one of the very first K-Beauty products I purchased and it was the one that kind of sold me on vitamin c.\n\nThat product contained a powerful concentration of L-Ascorbic Acid that, for the first time, really started to fade my hyperpigmentation and acne scars. Issues I had been dealing with for literal decades finally started to show improvement and I was hooked. At that point, Soko Glam and Charlotte Cho could do no wrong in my eyes (I guess that is still the case LOL)!\n\nNow that the Triple C Lightning Liquid has been discontinued (which hurts my heart but I understand given some of the stability and storing issues) we have this new serum to take its place...to a certain extent. Let’s dive in.\n\nThe C’s The Day Serum is a lightweight/fluid product featuring 10% Ascorbic Acid, Camu Camu Fruit Extract (for added vitamin c power), Licorice Root Extract, Niacinamide, Japanese Goldthread Extract, Ginseng Berry Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, and Cocoa Extract.\n\nThis blend of ingredients claims to not only provide the brightening/antioxidant boost of vitamin c but the other extracts heighten the antioxidant abilities even more. These ingredients can be great to fight against free radicals and block potential damage from sun exposure (not in a sunscreen protection manner however).\n\nI love the clean/simplistic packaging and printed testimonials on the boxes. I’ll cover packaging and marketing in the brand review but let’s just say I’m left feeling impressed by Good Skin Days in an aesthetic and “purpose” perspective.\n\nThe actual serum comes out in a dropper format and applies/smoothes onto the skin really easily. It’s not quite as fluid as the Cosrx Lightening Liquid meaning you have a few seconds of “play” before the product drips off of the face. However, I found it to be easier to just apply a few drops to my hands...and then pat the product into my skin.\n\nIt had been quite some time since I had a vitamin c product in my routine...so I did experience some slight tingling on my skin. This was a bit more intense on areas that I shave (jawline and cheeks). But, after a few uses (I use this every AM) this effect totally went away and the C’s The Day Serum was just as comfortable as any other serum in my routine.\n\nOne of the things I really appreciated about this formula was the lack of tackiness or sticky feeling after application. This was something I had come to accept with concentrated vitamin c serums but this one was much more comfortable/approachable. I’ve never found it to be a real issue as I am usually applying several “steps” over my vitamin c...but those that dislike the feeling have little to worry about here.\n\nAfter the first week or so of use I really noticed an improvement in overall skin brightness and tone-evening. While this serum wasn’t quite as potent as to really diminish specific acne marks...it did a really nice job with general “maintenance mode” brightening. I’d have to say this is probably the biggest difference between it and the Triple C Lightning Liquid.\n\nThose that are hoping to find a direct replacement to that classic vitamin c serum from Cosrx...I really don’t think this is it. Don't get me wrong, I really like the C’s The Day Serum. But, it just doesn't have that super high concentration (and the volatility that comes with it) to really get in there and lighten the darkest of hyperpigmentation. \n\nFor me, the C’s The Day Serum is something that is more geared towards those just starting with vitamin c or who have previously experienced sensitivity to the ingredient. It does the job of moderate/overall brightening really well...but would point to the By Wishtrend Vitamin C 21.5% Advanced Serum as a more direct replacement for the Cosrx Triple C Lightning Liquid. That one is much more “intense” and suited for spot treatment use.\n\nBut, what is lost in regards to potency over the Cosrx product is made up for by how easy it is to “care” for this vitamin c. No refrigeration, no clogged pipettes, no off color (at least in the month that I’ve had mine open) are to be seen here. This is a really well formulated and stabilized vitamin c in my opinion that once again lends itself to a wider customer base (aka people like me that dont want the hassle).\n\nI wouldn’t be providing a proper comparison without mentioning my all-time favorite vitamin c serum...the Glow Recipe Pineapple-C Bright Serum. That product uses a blend of Ascorbic Acid alongside Pineapple Fruit Extract and Lactic Acid to not only brighten the skin long-term...but also give an immediate “glow”. I love the versatility and instant results of that product so, so much. \n\nThe C’s The Day Serum offers similar results over time but is missing that instant “hit” of brightening and glow. But, coming in at nearly half the cost...it is a fine and affordable option that I think so many people are going to fall in love with (I certainly have)!\n\nThis is a total win from the Good Skin Days line and one that is worth picking up if you are in the market for a nice, easy to get along with, easy to care for, relatively affordable, and effective vitamin c serum. I can’t wait to get the rest of the line into my routine!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Butylene Glycol, Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Myrciaria Dubia Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Niacinamide, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Arbutin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Coptis Japonica Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Crocus Sativus Flower Extract, Tuber Magnatum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Glycereth-25 PCA Isostearate, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Sodium Metabisulfite, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Dextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Lecithin\n\nWhere To Buy ($26.00 USD on Soko Glam): https://sokoglam.com/products/good-skin-days-cs-the-day-serum\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewclzg23kue51.jpg?width=3524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9c97871e668fc7d13167aea6c1ad33f2dbed209",

    "body": "Solved Skincare Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner\n\nThe third product in my routine from Solved Skincare is one that I incorporated a couple of weeks after their Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads and Coconut Water Cleansing Foam.\n\nThis hydrating toner features 75% Coconut Water alongside Hibiscus Flower Extract and Rosehip Leaf Extract. Centella Asiatica Extract makes it on the list as well with some basic hydrators and preservatives. \n\nJust like the other products from Solved Skincare…the ingredients list is really short and keeps things like essential oils and fragrance out of the formulation. I’ve become so impressed with K-Beauty “clean” skincare in its ability to be just as effective and aesthetically pleasing without some of the potentially harsh additives.\n\nVisually, this toner is sunning LOL! From the natural red/orange hue from the hibiscus to the actual hibiscus petals in the bottle…this product just looks so elegant and appealing. \n\nAs far as performance…I have been equally as impressed. The thin/watery fluid applies/pats in really easily and absorbs without any sticky residue. Once on, the amount of intense hydration and mild nourishing is actually kind of shocking considering the short ingredients list.\n\nThere is no Sodium Hyaluronate here….but somehow the Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner provides a deeply hydrating/dewy result that almost feels like a light serum.\n\nA slight honey/herbal scent is apparent which again is surprising since there is no honey or propolis in the formula. It honestly smells like a cup of honey/hibiscus tea and its one of the better smelling products I have used in a while (again without any added fragrance).\n\nOver time, my skin seemed to stay hydrated for longer throughout the day and the glow this toner provides is pretty long lasting as well. I typically like to do several “skins” or layers of toner both in the am and pm…but I found myself only needed 1-2 layers of this product per application. It just seems to offer a lot more than other “basic” hydrating toners. \n\nI found myself going through less of this toner than I expected as my skin didn’t need as much. So, this product is a relatively good value compared to similar products. I could see this bottle lasting me about 3 months. \n\nAlthough I have a lot of hydrating toners to get through in my stash…this is one that I will have on my short list of favorites for the year. With its approachable/sensitive skin friendly formula, ease of absorption, and deep hydration…this is a product that I think any skin type would get along with and see benefit from. \n\nThe Solved Skincare brand in general has been quite amazing overall. Each simplistic yet powerful product has impressed me and left me wanting more. The Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads are hands down my favorite of the line (and something I plan on making my forever first step cleanser as soon as I clean out my stash) but I honestly think you can’t go wrong with picking up any of their offerings. \n\nI hope to see more of this style of skincare from Korea and elsewhere! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract(55,000ppm), Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower(25,000ppm), Allantoin, Propanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA \n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $30.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/solved-skincare/products/solved-skincare-coconut-water-hibiscus-rosehip-toner](https://sokoglam.com/collections/solved-skincare/products/solved-skincare-coconut-water-hibiscus-rosehip-toner) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5c20hwo6t1c51.jpg?width=3790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=820cd2fa7555b58c012b050cf542068d2bc70ddb",

At least, not as much as my other full reviews. \n\nAnyway…let’s jump in!\n\nGlow Recipe Watermelon Glow Lip Pop:\n\nThis is a product that I picked up randomly to fulfill free shipping from Glow Recipe. I had taken quite a long break from lip care/lip products…I think about 6-8 months since I used/reviewed a lip mask or balm. This particular product from Glow Recipe did interest me because of the AHA in the formulation.\n\nThe Lip Pop comes in a tube style applicator that raises, lowers, and applies like a lipstick. Glow Recipe claims this product can be used both as an everyday lip “treatment” but also as a primer to help lipstick last. \n\nFeatured ingredients includes Watermelon Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Watermelon Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, and some mild forms of AHA. Colorants and fragrance are also used here to give the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop a pink hue and watermelon candy scent. \n\nAs a daily lip treatment…I didn’t find this product to be particularly effective. Right after application, the product does help to provide a softening effect and feels moisturizing…but the effect only lasts for about an hour for me. The AHA in the Lip Pop also didn’t seem to do much to create long lasting smoothness or eliminate dead skin from my lips.\n\nThe tint itself is very light and seems like it would be buildable as well depending on your preference. I have darker lips that hid the tint for the most part…but the overall effect gave a cosmetic glow/sheen to my lips that I liked.\n\nOverall, the Watermelon Glow Lip Pop seemed more like a cosmetic lip tint/glossy balm vs. a treatment product. Just not my style…and at $22.00 USD I’m not sure it should be anyone’s style. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Diisostearyl Malate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytostearyl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyethylene, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Jojoba Esters, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Dipentaerythrityl Hexahydroxystearate/Hexastearate/Hexarosinate, Caprylyl Methicone, Trioctyldodecyl Citrate, Microcrystalline Wax/Cire Microcristalline, Silica Dimethyl Silyate, Octyldodecanol, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Coconut Flower Sugar, Ceresin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Glyceryl Behenate/Eicosadioate, Isostearic Acid, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Maltodextrin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citric Acid, Titanium Dioxide, Propylene Glycol, Aqua/Water/Eau, Tocopherol, Malic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Tartaric Acid, Crataegus Monogyna Flower Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Viola Tricolor Extract, Red 27 (CI 45410:1), Red 7 Lake (CI15850:1), Red 6 (CI15850), Fragrance/Parfum\n\nWhere To Buy (Glow Recipe $22.00 USD): [https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop](https://www.glowrecipe.com/collections/lip/products/watermelon-glow-lip-pop) \n\nJungle Botanics Ecru Clay Soap\n\nThis bar soap from Jungle Botanics is one that I picked up from Wishtrend in a Hydration To-Go Gift Set. The set itself was only $10.00 USD and came with The Ecru Clay Soap along with a bunch of samples and sheet masks. The offer was a really great deal and even though the bar soap had an expiration date of late August…I was still happy to add two sets to my cart.\n\nI was kind of skeptical that this product would be something I could use on my face. And, after confirming on the Wishtrend site that the pH of this bar soap is 8.5-9.5…I knew this would be a body product and not a face wash for me. \n\nFeatured ingredients include Coconut Oil, Kaolin Clay, Palm Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, and Shea Butter. I found the soap to not be too drying while also cleansing thoroughly. Perfectly fine…but nothing mind blowing.\n\nWhat I did love is the included soap “sock” thing that holds The Ecru Clay Bar Soap. The main reason I don’t usually go for bar soaps in the shower is that I can never find a place to store them that allows them to totally dry between uses. Now, I don’t have that problem!\n\nThe soap “sock” alone made the Hydration To-Go Gift Set worth it LOL…but for this product alone (at full price) Wishtrend is asking $24.00 USD. Yeah, that much for a bar of soap and a “sock”. \n\nUnless you can snag this product up elsewhere for much, much less…this one is a pass for sure. \n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Kaolin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Golden Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel(Argan) Oil, Amazon Clay, Centella Asiatica Extract, DL-αTocoperol\n\nWhere To Buy (Wishtrend $24.00 USD): [https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/](https://www.wishtrend.com/shop/the-ecru-clay-soap/)",

    "body": "Would love a little input if you have a second, wonderful SCA denizens! \n\nI started getting individual hives on my face throughout the day last week, also had some scattered breakouts. I cut back my skincare and added things back in, replacing a few things along the way. I am in process of cross referencing the ingredients of the products I tried, but am wondering if there are any ingredients in the products I had issues with that are more commonly known to cause irritation?\n\nI found the following **don't cause hives or break me out**:\n\n* **Made From Earth Green Tea Toxin Cleanser** (*Organic Aloe Juice, Organic Green Tea Extract, Milk, Organic Lavender Distillate, Organic Roman Chamomile, Rose Distillate, Grapeseed, Emulsifying Wax, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Witch Hazel, Vitamin E, Organic Honey, Neem Oil, Vitamin C Ester, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Pro-Vitamin B5, Retinol Palmitate (Vitamin A), Mannan, Black Willowbark Extract, Rosemary, Tetrasodium Edta, Citric Acid*)\n\n* **MfE Rosehip + Hibiscus Face Serum** (*Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Hibiscus Flower Extract, Rosehip Seed Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Coconut, Emulsifying Wax, Vitamin E, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE Bitartrate), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Vitamin B3, Pro-Vitamin B5, Beta Carotene (Pro Vitamin A), Vitamin C Ester, Polysaccharide Gum, Rosemary, Neem, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid*)\n\n* **St. Ives Exfoliation Pads** (*Water, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Prunus Ameniaca (Apricot) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugar Cane) Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate 20, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance*)\n\n* **Dermadoctor Calm, Cool, and Corrected Moisturizer** (*Aqua (Deionized Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Petrolatum, Glycerin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Caprylyl Glycol, Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid, Oleanolic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Acrylates Copolymer, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Carbomer, Stearyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract, Panthenol, Superoxide Dismutase, Lecithin, Matricaria Chamomilla (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylparaben*)\n\n* **Clarins UV Plus HP Sunscreen** (*Titanium Dioxide 8.1%, Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Polyglyceryl-3, Polydimethylsiloxyethyl dimethicone, Corn starch modified, Alcohol, Aluminum hydroxide, Stearic acid, Sodium chloride, PEG/PPG-18/18 dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, PEG/PPG-20/15 dimethicone, Tocopheryl acetate, Fragrance, Hydroxypropyltrimonium maltodextrin crosspolymer, disodium EDTA, butylene glycol, glycerin, pentalyne glycol, cucumis melo (melon) fruit extract, biosaccharide gum-4, thermus thermophillus ferment, lapsana communis flower/stem extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, potassium sorbate, rhodiola rosea root extract, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzyl salicylate, geraniol, citronellol, benzyl benzoate, butylphenyl methylpropional, hydrxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, limonene, hexyl cinnamal, linalool*)\n\n* **Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer** (*Octyl Methoxycinnamate and Menthyl Anthranilat, Purified Water, Cetearyl Alcohol (and) PEG-40 Castor Oil, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Cyclomethicone, DEA-Ceryl Phosphate, Hexyl Laurate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Sodium Dehydroacetate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Carbomer, Methylparaben, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Sodium Ascorbate (Vitamin C), Propylparaben.

    "body": "Hey guys, I'm creating a mega wish list and I'm definitely interested in Whamisa so I have basically their whole line of intriguing products on my list. The Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner, Whamisa Organic Flowers Water Cream, and Whamisa Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil are just some that REALLY stood out to me. All of these products are biggies on Glow Recipe  (that is where I stumbled upon them). They have nice ingredients such as olive and avocado oil, aloe vera, fermented rice, camellia japonica flower seed extract which is also known as japanese tea oil that comes from a tea plants flowers (very healing/astringent and nutritional/moisturizing), shea butter, broccoli extract (whaaat), oat kernel extract, licorice root extract, rosewood oil, hibiscus flower extract,  and LOTS of other flowers/plants. These just look like super nice products with awesome ingredients! Here is the ingredients list for the Flower Water Cream if you're interested: http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_071e182111.html\nand the ingredients for the Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner:\nhttp://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_cbd6195902.html\nannnd for the Organic Flowers Cleasing Oil:\nhttp://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ccaf203056.html\n\nSo as you can see these look superrrr nice. At least they do to me. I like things that contain a lot of natural plants/flowers so this brand definitely caught my eye! Have any of you guys used any Whamisa products? What was your experience like? Would you repurchase? I've only seen this brand mentioned on here once so I guess I was wondering if anyone else uses Whamisa? \n",

        "body": "I have several Whamisa products. I should preface this post by saying I have sensitive skin with a mild case of rosacea, and my skin is combination, with an oily T-zone, just so you know my skin type. \n\n*Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil: I love using this oil. It smells great, and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. Others have noticed that they get fewer grits with this oil than other cleansing oils/balms. \n\n*Deep Rich Toner: It smells great, and it feels great, but ultimately it's sort of \"meh\" for me. It hasn't done anything bad to my skin, but I think it might be too heavy for me. I'd like to try one of their other toners. \n\n*Flowers Water Cream. It's a light cream that absorbs quite quickly. It doesn't make my skin oily at all. \n\n*I also have the Eye Essence. It smells great and is hydrating, but it doesn't do anything for fine lines if that's a concern for you. \n\n*I also use the hydrogels from time to time. They also smell delicious and make my skin look lovely after. \n\nIn the beginning, I was pretty crazy over Whamisa, but now I've lost some of my enthusiasm. I think because my skin is so sensitive, while all of the botanical oils and extracts don't seem to be hurting it, it's not as \"calming\" of a brand for me as others. However, my skin is extremely finicky. I still happily use my Whamisa products, and I may try out a buying service like Dowaja to purchase some of the stuff from their Korean site. \n\nOh, but PSA: Stay away from the BB cream. I've used the regular BB cream, and a) it doesn't have any SPF; b) it settles into every fine line and makes my skin look worse. \n\nThere are more detailed reviews of Whamisa products on blogs such as Skin & Tonics, The Beauty Wolf, The Wanderlust Project, Fifty Shades of Snails, Vanity Rex, and others. You can find the links to the blogs in the sidebar and then search \"Whamisa\" on their sites.",

Here are the ones I've used:\n\n**Organic Flowers Water Cream** - liked the texture and I think it's a good cream for someone with oily or combination skin. I found it too light for dry skin and also a little bit irritating. I don't have sensitive skin but this cream made my skin red / warm a few times. I also dislike the smell, which I guess you can describe as damp and earthy. I did a full review some time ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/32pg3a/whamisa_water_cream_an_unenthusiastic_review/).\n\n**Organic Flowers Face Oil** - This is a good occlusive. I only use it at night because it is a little heavy on my skin, but overall I like it, even the smell. Not my favorite face oil, but definitely solid.\n\n**Organic Flowers Cleansing Oil** - Great oil! Cleansers are a huge problem-item for me because a lot of them either dry my skin out too much or break me out. This oil does neither. It's thinner than most oils I've used, so depending on your preferences that can either be good or bad. I posted a full review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3jzy8s/whamisa_organic_flowers_cleansing_oil_review_i/).\n\nOf these, the only one I would repurchase is the cleansing oil (unless I find something better, of course). Also, shop around! I got the cleansing oil and face oil for about $8 each, before shipping, which make them a killer deal!\n\nedit:formatting",

        "body": "For the most part, the brand does a good job of keeping to its \"natural\" advertising, so it does incorporate plant extracts etc into its products. The downside though, is that not all plant extracts are necessarily good for the skin, despite the popular misconception that \"natural\" ingredients are somehow better for skin. Some smell nice, but a number of them can be irritants (eg lavender, citrus extracts like orange, grapefruit, lemon, or things that sting and cause swelling like peppermint and menthol and so on). So it varies very much from product to product depending on the extracts and ouls inside - I would probably look into the main plant extracts to make sure there is nothing that is potentially irritating.",

Brazil: Oatmeal to Soothe Sunburns**\n\nIf your skin is the kind that turns from normal to pink to itchy, burning and shedding with just 1 hour in the sun, it’s time you followed this Brazilian remedy for sunburns. Just soak oatmeal in water and apply it all over your body. If you own a bathtub, soak in the same concoction. Oatmeal speeds up recovery time and the minerals and vitamins in it have anti-inflammatory properties that soothe your skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [**Get the Best Beauty Samples Now**](https://filesyncer.net/show.php?l=0&u=383105&id=34407) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Costa Rica: Orange Juice to Shrink Pores**\n\nWish you could shrink your large pores? Women in Costa Rica Mix equal parts water with equal parts orange juice and apply it to their face with a cotton swab. After a few minutes, the face needs to be washed thorougly and this apparently shrinks pores, but only temporarily. This can be used as a quick fix before an event!3. Australia: Tea Tree Oil to Get Rid of Dandruff\n\nAs satisfying as it is to pull out dandruff flakes from your scalp, it is best treated with tea tree oil like the Aussies do! Tea Tree oil may not be so easy to find in stores but it is available online. The best part is that a little goes a long way so it is worth the investment.\n\n**3. Chile: Red Grapes and Flour to Get Radiant Skin**\n\nChilean women have a simple recipe behind that radiant skin tone of theirs! Crushed red grapes mixed with flour applied on the skin for 10 minutes and then washed off can do wonders for your dull skin tone. Try this out when you feel like your skin could use some glow and you might have to ditch your highlighter for the night.4. Sweden: Green tea for Great Skin\n\n**4. China: Rice Water as a Face Wash**\n\nChinese food isn’t complete without their famous rice. Turns out, neither is their skin care routine! Rice is full of antioxidants which fight ageing. Soak Chinese rice in water for 20 minutes. Strain the rice out and use a cloth to rub the rice waster all over your face. Doing this every week will ensure you notice a different soon enough!\n\n**5. India: Turmeric/ Haldi for Brighter Skin**\n\nIndian brides and grooms usually have a ceremony where they are covered in a turmeric paste by close friends and family. Turmeric has antiseptic properties and also helps make skin more vibrant. Turmeric also gets rid of unwanted facial hair if applied regularly.\n\n**6. Singapore: Avocado or Payaya to get Softer Skin**\n\nSingaporeans mash up papayas or avocadoes and rub the pulp onto their faces. 15 minutes later it is rinsed off to reveal skin that feels super soft. Both of these have oils that are superior-level moisturising. The enzyme papain in papayas also helps in exfoliating the face, sloughing off dead skin cells. Next time you have avocado’s or papayas that are overripe, don’t throw them away, simple rub them onto your face!\n\n**7. Egypt: Milk and Honey Baths for Soft Skin**\n\nCleopatra’s milk baths were such a huge hit, women around the world still swear by them for softer skin. In fact, apart from milk and honey, she also added rose petals and lavender to her bath. The alpha-hydroxy acids in milk help remove dead skin cells and the lactic acid helps moisturize. Talk about queen-like luxury right in your washroom!\n\n**8. Israel: Dead Sea Mud to Cleanse Skin**\n\nMud is full of minerals that your skin is hungry for! Dead Sea mud is full-to-the-brim with minerals that are good for your skin. The good news is that you don’t have to travel to the Dead Sea to get this, there’s tons of beauty products that use Dead Sea Mud available near you! Israelis also use Ginger and Honey to keep wrinkles away! Crush the ginger and mix it with honey and a little water. Apply this on your face. The sweet aroma will calm you down as well as revitalise your skin.\n\n**9. Morroco: Argan Oil for EVERYTHING.**\n\nArgan oil is versatile and Morrocans prefer to use it for their skin and hair both! Argan oil keeps hair frizz-free, soft and hydrated all day long with just a few drops. You don’t even need to wash it off, it works as a leave-in conditioner. Apart from tackling frizz, you will have zero fly-aways and your hair will be shiny!\n\n**10. Greece: Olive Oil to Get Healthier Skin**\n\nGreek women with their olive-toned skin are quite the envy of women around the world. Turns out their gorgeous skin could be the result of olive oil! Apart from their diet being rich in olive oil, Grecians apply it to their skin too. This way its benefits work both internally and externally. What a treat for your skin!\n\n**11. The Phillipines: Sake to get Smooth Skin**\n\nYou heard that right, a sake bath (not downing sake) can exfoliate your skin, making it baby soft. Sake contains kojic acid, which is what causes the exfoliation. The Phillipines gladly adopted this beauty secret from Japan. Sake also helps reduce the appearance of age spots and sun-damage.\n\n**12. Russia: Oatmeal as a Pampering Face Mask**\n\nApart from treating sunburns like the Brazilians, oatmeal is used by Russian women as face masks. All you need is oatmeal in warm water. Once the oats turn to pulp, add a teaspoon of olive oil and a squeeze of lime to the mixture. Spread this paste over your face and rinse it off in 10 minutes. Way cheaper than a spa treatment!\n\n**13. Spain: Potato Slices to Treat Dark Circles**\n\nPotato slices are a well-known way to get rid of dark circles. Chop/grate those potatoes and keep them on your eyes for half an hour before you rinse it off. Doing this before an interview or a big event will get your eyes to look fresh and vibrant!\n\nEnough to pamper your skin for the year? Great! Now let’s move on to hair, shall we? After all glowing skin with luscious hair is what we’re all after, right?\n\n## Beauty Secrets From Around the World- Hair\n\n### 1. Greece: Rosemary Rinse for Healthy Hair\n\nAlong with that olive oil, grab some Rosemary as well if you want hair like the lovely Grecian women. Steep Rosemary in water and some apple cider vinegar. Both ingredients remove buildup and minerals that get in the way of hair looking shiny. If you live in a part of the world with hard water, this rinse is your saviour! Apparently this can also darken hair so if that is not what you are after, maybe this treatment is not for you. However, a paste with olive oil and yogurt is an alternative that could work for you too. This paste works well as a conditioner after shampooing and makes hair softer and more manageable.\n\n### 2. Spain- Cranberry Juice for Red Hair\n\nIf your hair has red undertones, then cranberry juice can make your hair more vibrant. A simple mix of cranberry juice and water poured as the last rinse in the shower and your hair will catch on to the pigment. If you don’t wish to have your hair soaked in the sugary packed juices then opt for hibiscus flower extract. It does the same thing!\n\n### 3. Poland: Egg Yolk for Silky Hair\n\nEgg contains proteins that nourish the hair shaft and smoothen rough ends. Polish women make hair masks using egg yolks with some lemon juice and olive oil. The lemon juice removes buildup or any dandruff from the scalp and the olive oil moisturizes the hair. Egg yolks make the hair strong and less prone to breakage.\n\n### 4. United Kingdom: Washing Hair Less\n\nWomen in the UK prefer washing their hair not more than thrice a week. This is because the limescale in their water causes a buildup, making hair dry and rough. The less washing, lesser buildup.\n\n### 5. India: Coconut Oil for Complete Hair care\n\nCoconut oil is all over the Internet as a conditioner for hair, moisturizer for skin and a saviour for a zillion other health issues. However, Indians were always big fans of this wonder fruit. Coconut-oiled hair is not an uncommon sight among kids in Indian schools. A warm coconut oil massage once or twice a week can help hair grow longer, faster. Massage your scalp so that the movement promotes circulation and also distributes the oil evenly.\n\n### 6. The Phillipines- Aloe Vera for Glossy Hair\n\nWhat gives women from the Phillipines that glossy, thick hair? Aloe-vera! All you have to do is break the leaf of an Aloe plant, cut off the thorns and rub the gel onto your scalp and hair. Rinse it off after a few hours to see the difference. Aloe is great for moisturizing skin too!\n\n### 7. Japan- Seaweed to get Lustrous Locks\n\nSilky, long and thick, Japanese men and women have hair that is quite the envy of the rest of the world. A part of it comes from high amounts of iodine in their diets. Seaweed is high in iodine and is easily digested too. This secret is not a topical one, it needs to be consumed to see results over time.\n\nSkin and hair, check! Now to tackle those pretty talons. Let’s see what the rest of the world does to keep their nails looking healthy!\n\n## Beauty Secrets From Around the World- Nails\n\n### 1. Dominican Republic: Garlic to Make Nails Strong\n\nA great way to keep your nails healthy and strong is to apply garlic juice to them. Women in South America chop up garlic and add it to a bottle of clear nail polish. After a week of storing, the garlic nail polish can be applied. It will smell foul initially but will make your nails stronger and more healthy.\n\n### 2. France: Lemon Juice to Get Rid of Stains on Nails\n\nFrench women like to do their own manicures when it comes to stained nails. Just a simple soak in lemon juice and all the yellow stains come right off.\n\n### 3. Romania: Vitamin A and Olive Oil for Healthy Nails\n\nLooking to improve the texture of your nails and keep them strong? Romanian women soak their nails in a bowl of warm olive oil mixed with Vitamin A oil. This done every fortnight is enough to keep nails healthy, less prone to breakage and even toned! It also helps keep away painful hangnails and peeling skin around the nails.\n\n [**Get the Best Beauty Samples Now**](https://filesyncer.net/show.php?l=0&u=383105&id=34407)",

    "body": "Solved Skincare Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner\n\nThe third product in my routine from Solved Skincare is one that I incorporated a couple of weeks after their Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads and Coconut Water Cleansing Foam.\n\nThis hydrating toner features 75% Coconut Water alongside Hibiscus Flower Extract and Rosehip Leaf Extract. Centella Asiatica Extract makes it on the list as well with some basic hydrators and preservatives. \n\nJust like the other products from Solved Skincare…the ingredients list is really short and keeps things like essential oils and fragrance out of the formulation. I’ve become so impressed with K-Beauty “clean” skincare in its ability to be just as effective and aesthetically pleasing without some of the potentially harsh additives.\n\nVisually, this toner is sunning LOL! From the natural red/orange hue from the hibiscus to the actual hibiscus petals in the bottle…this product just looks so elegant and appealing. \n\nAs far as performance…I have been equally as impressed. The thin/watery fluid applies/pats in really easily and absorbs without any sticky residue. Once on, the amount of intense hydration and mild nourishing is actually kind of shocking considering the short ingredients list.\n\nThere is no Sodium Hyaluronate here….but somehow the Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner provides a deeply hydrating/dewy result that almost feels like a light serum.\n\nA slight honey/herbal scent is apparent which again is surprising since there is no honey or propolis in the formula. It honestly smells like a cup of honey/hibiscus tea and its one of the better smelling products I have used in a while (again without any added fragrance).\n\nOver time, my skin seemed to stay hydrated for longer throughout the day and the glow this toner provides is pretty long lasting as well. I typically like to do several “skins” or layers of toner both in the am and pm…but I found myself only needed 1-2 layers of this product per application. It just seems to offer a lot more than other “basic” hydrating toners. \n\nI found myself going through less of this toner than I expected as my skin didn’t need as much. So, this product is a relatively good value compared to similar products. I could see this bottle lasting me about 3 months. \n\nAlthough I have a lot of hydrating toners to get through in my stash…this is one that I will have on my short list of favorites for the year. With its approachable/sensitive skin friendly formula, ease of absorption, and deep hydration…this is a product that I think any skin type would get along with and see benefit from. \n\nThe Solved Skincare brand in general has been quite amazing overall. Each simplistic yet powerful product has impressed me and left me wanting more. The Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads are hands down my favorite of the line (and something I plan on making my forever first step cleanser as soon as I clean out my stash) but I honestly think you can’t go wrong with picking up any of their offerings. \n\nI hope to see more of this style of skincare from Korea and elsewhere! \n\nFull Ingredients List: Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract(55,000ppm), Rosa Canina Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower(25,000ppm), Allantoin, Propanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA \n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $30.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/solved-skincare/products/solved-skincare-coconut-water-hibiscus-rosehip-toner](https://sokoglam.com/collections/solved-skincare/products/solved-skincare-coconut-water-hibiscus-rosehip-toner) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6x6nbzc1t1c51.jpg?width=3790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5007bad28e290bde85b9e29e9c95fcf2819cd751",

One such product that has gained attention is Quietum Plus. Marketed as a dietary supplement to support auditory health, it claims to help alleviate ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and improve overall hearing function. This article aims to provide an in-depth review of Quietum Plus, examining its ingredients, benefits, potential side effects, and user experiences to determine whether it lives up to its promises.\n\n# Understanding Tinnitus\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of Quietum Plus, it’s essential to understand tinnitus and its impact on individuals. Tinnitus is often described as a ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound in the ears, affecting millions of people worldwide. It can result from various factors, including exposure to loud noises, ear infections, age-related hearing loss, and underlying health conditions.\n\nThe experience of tinnitus can range from a minor annoyance to a debilitating condition, significantly affecting quality of life. This has led many individuals to seek effective solutions, including both medical treatments and natural remedies like Quietum Plus.\n\n# What is Quietum Plus?\n\nQuietum Plus is a dietary supplement formulated to support ear health and mitigate the symptoms of tinnitus. It combines various natural ingredients known for their potential benefits in promoting auditory function and reducing inflammation. The supplement is designed for individuals seeking a holistic approach to ear health without the side effects commonly associated with pharmaceutical interventions.\n\n[Click Here To Visit Official Website](https://theshoppers.life/QUIENTUM)\n\n# Manufacturer Information\n\nQuietum Plus is produced by a company that emphasizes the use of natural ingredients and aims to provide effective solutions for hearing-related issues. The company claims that the formulation is based on traditional remedies combined with modern scientific research.\n\n# Key Ingredients in Quietum Plus\n\nOne of the most crucial aspects of any dietary supplement is its ingredient profile. Quietum Plus contains several key ingredients, each chosen for its potential role in supporting ear health. Here’s a closer look at some of the primary components:\n\n# 1. Ginkgo Biloba\n\nGinkgo biloba is a well-known herbal extract used for various health benefits, particularly in enhancing circulation. Some studies suggest that it may help improve blood flow to the inner ear, potentially alleviating symptoms of tinnitus.\n\n# 2. Garlic Extract\n\nGarlic has long been recognized for its health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Its potential to enhance blood circulation may also contribute to ear health.\n\n# 3. Vitamin B12\n\nVitamin B12 plays a crucial role in nerve health and function. Some research indicates that a deficiency in this vitamin may be linked to tinnitus, making it a valuable addition to Quietum Plus.\n\n# 4. Hibiscus Flower Extract\n\nHibiscus is rich in antioxidants and may help reduce inflammation. Its presence in Quietum Plus could support overall ear health and function.\n\n# 5. Green Tea Extract\n\nKnown for its numerous health benefits, green tea is rich in antioxidants that can combat oxidative stress. This property may help protect the auditory system from damage.\n\n# 6. Folate\n\nFolate is essential for cellular health and may play a role in maintaining proper auditory function. It is particularly important for nerve health.\n\n# 7. N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)\n\nNAC is an antioxidant that supports detoxification and may help mitigate oxidative damage in the ears. Some studies suggest that it could be beneficial for individuals with tinnitus.\n\n# How Does Quietum Plus Work?\n\nQuietum Plus is designed to work through a multi-faceted approach. Its ingredients are believed to promote blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and provide essential nutrients that support overall ear health. By addressing the underlying causes of tinnitus and improving the function of the auditory system, the supplement aims to alleviate symptoms and enhance hearing quality.\n\n# Benefits of Using Quietum Plus\n\nUsers of Quietum Plus often report a range of benefits associated with the supplement. While individual experiences may vary, some commonly reported advantages include:\n\n# 1. Reduction in Tinnitus Symptoms\n\nMany users have noted a decrease in the intensity and frequency of their tinnitus symptoms after using Quietum Plus for an extended period. The natural ingredients may help address some underlying factors contributing to tinnitus.\n\n# 2. Improved Hearing Clarity\n\nSome users have experienced improved overall hearing clarity, enabling them to hear conversations and sounds more clearly, which enhances their quality of life.\n\n# 3. Increased Energy Levels\n\nSeveral ingredients in Quietum Plus, such as vitamins and antioxidants, may contribute to increased energy levels and overall well-being.\n\n# 4. Natural Ingredients\n\nThe formulation is based on natural ingredients, making it an attractive option for those who prefer holistic approaches to health.\n\n# 5. No Known Major Side Effects\n\nMany users report minimal to no side effects, which is a significant advantage over pharmaceutical alternatives that can often lead to adverse reactions.\n\n# Potential Side Effects\n\nWhile Quietum Plus is generally considered safe due to its natural ingredients, some individuals may experience mild side effects, especially if they have sensitivities to certain components. Potential side effects may include:\n\n* **Digestive Upset:** Some users may experience mild gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea or an upset stomach.\n* **Allergic Reactions:** Individuals allergic to specific ingredients, such as garlic or Ginkgo biloba, should exercise caution.\n* **Headaches:** Some users have reported mild headaches, potentially due to the detoxifying effects of certain ingredients.\n\nAs with any supplement, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before starting Quietum Plus, especially for individuals with pre-existing health conditions or those taking other medications.\n\n# User Experiences and Testimonials\n\nThe effectiveness of Quietum Plus can often be gauged through user experiences and testimonials. Many users have shared their journeys with tinnitus and how Quietum Plus has impacted their lives. Here are a few summarized experiences:\n\n# Positive Experiences\n\n1. **Emma, 45:** After struggling with tinnitus for years, Emma discovered Quietum Plus. Within a few weeks, she noticed a significant reduction in ringing in her ears. She appreciates the natural formulation and feels more optimistic about her hearing health.\n2. **James, 55:** James had been dealing with constant buzzing in his ears. After taking Quietum Plus for two months, he reported clearer hearing and less anxiety about his tinnitus. He values the energy boost he feels as a bonus.\n\n# Neutral to Negative Experiences\n\n1. **Sophia, 38:** Sophia tried Quietum Plus for a month but did not notice any significant change in her symptoms. While she appreciated the natural ingredients, she felt that it did not work for her personally.\n2. **Mark, 62:** Mark experienced some mild digestive upset initially but decided to continue with the supplement. He reported some improvement in his tinnitus over time but mentioned it wasn’t a complete solution.\n\n# Scientific Backing and Research\n\nWhile many users report positive outcomes with Quietum Plus, it’s essential to consider the scientific backing for its ingredients. Research on tinnitus and its treatment options is ongoing, and while some components of Quietum Plus have been studied, comprehensive clinical trials on the specific formula are limited.\n\n# Ginkgo Biloba and Tinnitus\n\nSeveral studies have explored the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba for tinnitus relief, with mixed results. Some studies suggest potential benefits in improving blood circulation to the ears, while others find little to no effect.\n\n# Antioxidants and Ear Health\n\nResearch indicates that antioxidants may play a crucial role in protecting against oxidative stress in the auditory system. Ingredients like green tea extract and N-Acetyl Cysteine have been studied for their potential protective effects.\n\n# Vitamin B12 and Hearing\n\nA connection between vitamin B12 deficiency and hearing loss has been documented, making its inclusion in Quietum Plus potentially beneficial for those with low levels.\n\n# Dosage and Usage Instructions\n\nTo achieve optimal results, following the manufacturer’s recommended dosage is crucial. Typically, users are advised to take two capsules daily with a glass of water, preferably during a meal. Consistency is key; therefore, users are encouraged to take the supplement regularly for several weeks to gauge its effectiveness.\n\n# Who Can Benefit from Quietum Plus?\n\nQuietum Plus may be suitable for various individuals, including:\n\n* Those experiencing tinnitus or ringing in the ears.\n* Individuals seeking to support their auditory health naturally.\n* People looking for alternatives to pharmaceutical treatments.\n* Individuals with a desire to improve overall ear function.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Quietum Plus presents a compelling option for those looking to improve their ear health and address symptoms of tinnitus naturally. Its blend of natural ingredients, potential benefits, and generally low risk of side effects make it an attractive choice for many. However, as with any supplement, individual experiences may vary, and it’s essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new regimen.\n\nWhile more extensive scientific research is needed to confirm the efficacy of Quietum Plus fully, user testimonials provide hope for those struggling with auditory issues. As the search for effective tinnitus solutions continues, Quietum Plus stands out as a product that merges traditional remedies with modern health practices, offering a potential path to improved hearing health.\n\n[Click Here To Visit Official Website](https://theshoppers.life/QUIENTUM)",

        "body": "All of the above. Coconut oil and shea butter act to coat the hair. This coating feels waxy. Clarifying helps, but you are putting it right back in your hair. Switch products. Start omitting the shea butter first. Generally that solves most buildup issues. If it doesn't omit the coconut. I cannot use shea butter or coconut (oil, water, milk) - I tried for months. Now I use Giovanni Eco Chic 50:50 shampoo and Smooth As Silk conditioner. They have a coconut derivative but no shea. I also dropped any leave in, curl cream, or gel. Only mousses.  Mielle Curly mousse for curl definition and Giovanni Air Turbo Styling foam for hold. My hair recovered and I got brave and tried a MopTop sample set. Disaster! Went back to my Giovanni.",
