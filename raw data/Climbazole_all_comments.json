    "body": "Ed eccoci ancora qua per la seconda parte della guida sulla dermatite seborroica.\n\nQui trovate la prima parte per chi se la fosse persa: [prima parte](https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/xjns2b/skincare_e_dermatite_seborroica_guida_completa/).\n\nAnzitutto vi ringrazio per il caloroso supporto nella precedente puntata. Sono molto felice di aver contribuito alla discussione e in tantissimi mi avete chiesto un'opinione sugli shampoo.\n\nPrima di iniziare, ci tengo a ribadire un concetto: **della dermatite seborroica non abbiamo capito un cazzo e non c'è una cura definitiva.** E' terribile, ma purtroppo viviamo in un sistema dove fare ricerca scientifica non conviene. Le case di dermocosmesi preferiscono tenere tutto vago per provare a vendere qualsiasi stupidaggine possibile. Nessuno ha un incentivo a fare degli studi seri e quei pochi che si fanno sono ridicoli, si parla di campioni da 10 persone. \n\nIo, come nella guida precedente, esporrò una serie di consigli pratici il quanto più possibile radicati nella ricerca scientifica. Ma siccome questa non ci dà una risposta definitiva, l'invito è sempre quello di sperimentare e se avete trovato un prodotto/routine che per voi funziona non posso che essere felice per voi.\n\nFaccio anche una premessa importante: io ho dei capelli grassissimi che producono una quantità d'olio imbarazzante. I miei consigli sono pensati per chi come me ha lo stesso tipo di cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 1: Il piano d'attacco\n\nNella prima parte della guida spiegavo come la dermatite seborroica si pensa sia causata dalla malassezia: un lievito che vive sulla nostra pelle e nel 3% della popolazione causa rossori ed ipersensibilità.\n\nIl problema forte è che non basta uccidere la malassezia per far sparire il problema. Tutta quanta l'incertezza scientifica sulla causa della dermatite seborroica, deriva dal fatto che anche una volta morta la malassezia, o addirittura anche solo componenti di essa rimaste sulla pelle, possono scatenare reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nIl nostro piano d'attacco deve dunque avere 3 priorità, che vanno in questo ordine:\n\n1.\t**Fare di tutto per impedire che la malassezia cresca**: siccome anche da morta sembra causare danni, il nostro obiettivo principale è fare in modo che non cresca proprio. Per fare questo dobbiamo da un lato deprivarla del suo cibo naturale (i trigliceridi a catena lunga, in pratica il grasso della nostra pelle) e dall'altro stare molto attenti ai prodotti che ci mettiamo sulla testa. Soprattutto le donne, che spesso usano balsami e molti altri ingredienti per la cura dei capelli. Se gli diamo da mangiare attivamente è la fine. La cosa peggiore in assoluto che si possa fare è qualche trattamento strano con l'olio d'oliva \"come facevano i nostri nonni\".\n2.\t**Gestire il prurito**: questa è la seconda priorità assoluta. Perchè? Perchè se avete prurito vi grattate e se vi grattate è un cazzo di casino. Quando vi grattate andate a danneggiare la barriera protettiva della pelle. Questo rende da un lato la pelle più suscettibile alle irritazioni e dall'altro si rende molto più difficile il corretto assorbimento dei prodotti da parte della pelle. Purtroppo grattarsi è un gesto spesso inconscio, quindi l'unico vero modo di affrontare la cosa è gestire fin da subito il prurito.\n3.\t**Uccidere la malassezia**: solo alla fine, come terza priorità, cerchiamo dei prodotti che ammazzino la malassezia. Questo aiuta soprattutto durante gli attacchi più pesanti e con i dolori acuti per mantenere sotto controllo il problema.\n\nCi tengo a stressare in particolare modo l'importanza di questo specifico ordine di priorità. \n\nSe ci pensate un attimo, è lo stesso identico motivo per cui non basta usare il collutorio per avere denti sani. Non basta uccidere i batteri, ma dobbiamo con lo spazzolino andare a rimuovere ciò di cui si nutrono. Solo così riusciamo a mantere in salute i nostri denti.\n\nPer gli amici ingegneri, il perchè intrinseco lo si trova nel \"modello logistico\". E' la stessa logica per cui non serve disinfestare le città per eliminare i topi definitivamente, ma bisogna tenere pulito e salubre il luogo in cui si vive. L'idea è che fintanto che c'è cibo a disposizione, tutti questi fenomeni sono governati da processi di crescita esponenziale. Quindi, non puoi pensare di uccidere la malassezia per rallentare una crescita esponenziale, dopo due ore siamo punto e a capo. Dobbiamo cambiare \"l'ambiente\" della malassezia affinchè, a livello strutturale, non ci sia cibo a sufficienza per sostenere una popolazione più grande di un certo numero di esemplari.\n\n# Parte 2: Gli ingredienti con evidenza scientifica (per i capelli) \n\nCredo di avervi stressato abbastanza con il concetto di prima. Ma ciò nonostante, quali sono gli ingredienti per combattere la dermatite seborroica?\n\nAnche qua, come spesso accade nel mondo della dermocosmesi, ci sono una miriade di minchiate e giusto una manciata di agenti attivi veramente efficaci. Non tutti sono adatti a qualsiasi tipo di cuoio capelluto, ma qua ci concentreremo sui principali per capelli grassi.\n\n1.\t**Disolfuro di selenio (selenium sulfide):** E' un antimicotico che rallenta la crescita della malassezia ed un agente cheratolitico (ovvero favorisce il ricambio superficiale degli strati della pelle). Può aiutare anche a gestire il prurito. Come funziona? Bho! Non si è capito molto del perchè abbia questi effetti o come li produca. Quello che sappiamo è che in alcuni studi da circa 250 persone (credetemi, sono sorprendentemente grandi per questo ambito della dermocosmesi) ha un'efficacia significativamente maggiore di un corrispettivo placebo. Al momento lo si sta anche studiando per eventuali utilizzi sugli occhi. Servirebbe a regolarizzare la produzione di olio dalle ghiandole che gestiscono il film oleo-acquoso che previene la secchezza oculare. **Fun Fact**: Raga io vi giuro, quando ero piccolo c'era un film / cartone animato dove c'erano questi che dovevano sconfiggere gli alieni. Un tizio scopriva che per loro il selenio era tossico e si andavano a comprare le bottiglie di shampoo antiforfora per sconfiggere gli alieni. Ve lo giuro non sono pazzo, ho questo ricordo stampato nel mio cervello.\n2.\t**Piroctone Olamina**: anche questo ingrediente viene utilizzato come antimicotico, ma sembra avere anche proprietà antisettiche più generalizzate. La sua efficacia sembra legata alla capacità di penetrare e spaccare la parete cellulare dei lieviti (oltre che di vari batteri). Spesso si trova insieme, o in sostituzione, dello Zinco piritione che ha effetti simili. Lo Zinco piritione, per chi si ricordasse qualcosa di biologia dalle superiori, nello specifico va a bloccare la pompa protonica delle cellule, andando a spaccare quel meccanismo che consente alle cellule di scambiare elementi con l'esterno.\n3.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral):** Ne abbiamo già parlato ed è uno degli antimicotici più efficaci sul mercato contro la malassezia. Oltre che in pomata, è presente anche sotto forma di shampoo per trattare attacchi acuti di dermatite.\n\nIn questo caso non dirò that's it, perchè ci sono a disposizione anche altri 3-4 ingredienti efficaci (Climbazole, Ciclopirox Olamine, Coal Tar). Ma conoscendo i 3 di cui sopra, più o meno avete un'idea di tutto quanto quello che c'è nell'80% degli shampoo antiforfora seri.\n\nInoltre, terrei sempre anche d'occhio la presenza degli ingredienti di cui abbiamo parlato nella guida sulla skincare. La **niacinamide** aiuta sempre con i rossori e **l'acido salicilico** è alla base della maggior parte dei trattamenti che si possono fare applicati direttamente al cuoio capelluto.\n\n# Parte 3: La routine e i consigli sui prodotti\n\nOra che abbiamo capito gli ingredienti e la filosofia alla base della routine, dobbiamo mettere tutto in pratica.\n\nL'aspetto più importante in assoluto è **la costanza.** Ricordate che il nostro obiettivo numero uno è evitare che la malassezia cresca fin dal principio. La costanza nella routine è la chiave. Io devo per forza farmi una doccia al giorno con gli shampoo. Mi basta saltare anche solo 2 giorni per avere immediatamente a distanza di poco tempo un attacco. A quel punto c'è poco da fare, si può solo contenere l'episodio. Questo perchè come abbiamo visto, anche da morta la malassezia sembra causare danni e reazioni infiammatorie.\n\nLo so che è palloso e spesso sono io il primo a non starci dietro, però per chi come noi soffre di questa patologia, tenere puliti e non grassi i capelli è la cosa più importante in assoluto.\n\nUn consiglio che dò a tutti è di comprarsi a 2/3€ delle bottigliette vuote da riempire con i nostri prodotti per quando si viaggia. Cercate di portarli sempre con voi, altrimenti le vacanze (o il ritorno) rischiano di essere rovinati.\n\nAltra cosa fondamentale, come detto, è quello di assicurarsi che nessun ingrediente alimenti la malassezia. Fortunatamente esiste questo sito web [https://www.sezia.co/](https://www.sezia.co/) che vi consente di identificare quali ingredienti non vanno bene. Per qualsiasi prodotto non dedicato alla cura della dermatite seborroica che volete utilizzare, andate ad inserire gli ingredienti lì dentro e vedete se può causare problemi o meno. In alternativa c'è anche questo database più dettagliato: https://folliculitisscout.com\n\nQuando andate dal parrucchiere / barbiere, declinate ogni prodotto a meno che non sappiate con precisione cosa ci sia dentro.\n\nPer quanto riguarda la routine vera e propria, quale ingrediente devo scegliere? Siete pronti? Lo volete proprio sapere? Rullo di tamburi... **Il gold standard è fare un mix and match.**\n\nNon sappiamo per quale motivo, ma dopo qualche settimana dall'inizio di un trattamento, la malassezia sembra smettere di rispondere. C'è chi dice che sia lo sviluppo di una qualche resistenza, chi dice che ci sia qualche biofilm protettivo che si viene a creare insieme ad altre comunità di funghi e batteri. Non lo sappiamo.\n\nPerò penso che tanti di noi abbiano trovato \"lo shampoo magico\" che per 1 mese ha funzionato e poi, boom! Di colpo un nuovo attacco.\n\nIl consiglio principale è quello di utilizzare un mix degli ingredienti sopra citati. Questo sembra prolungare di molto l'efficacia dei trattamenti.\n\nLa routine diventa dunque questa:\n\n1.\t**Trattamento per cuoio capelluto all'acido salicilico**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. Questo è l'unico vero trattamento applicato direttamente al cuoio capelluto prima del lavaggio. Io personalmente uso \"The Inkey list - Salicylic Acid Exfoliating Scalp Treatment\". Molto competitivo dal punto di vista del prezzo per essere un acido salicilico ed ha un packaging pensato per l'applicazione sul cuoio capelluto. E' fondamentale per rimuovere scaglie, accumuli di sebo e quant'altro.\n2.\t**Disolfuro di Selenio:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io utilizzo Vichy Dercos Technique per capelli grassi (che contiene anche lui acido salicilico, quindi magari questo shampoo non va insieme al trattamento). Attenzione che la linea dercos ha tanti prodotti con ingredienti diversi, quindi assicuratevi di comprare quello giusto.\n3.\t**Piroctone Olamina:** da utilizzare 2/3 volte a settimana. Io qua utilizzo i classici head & shoulders. Vi segnalo che alcuni possono includere \"Glycol Distearate\" che può nutrire la malassezia. Tuttavia la formulazione nel suo complesso sembra efficace e personalmente non mi ha mai dato problemi.\n4.\t**Ketoconazolo (Nizoral Shampoo)**: da utilizzare 1/2 volte a settimana. In caso di attacchi, diventa il vostro shampoo principale e l'utilizzo va potenziato a 3/4 volte a settimana.\n\nFacendo un buon mix di questi shampoo ed utilizzando la routine di skincare proposta precedentemente, la gestione della dermatite seborroica cambia completamente. Vedrete proprio una pella diversa, di un altro tipo, più pulita e lucente.\n\nIo spero che questi consigli possano tornarvi utili e se non altro a dare un po' di consapevolezza in cosa ci sia nei prodotti che ci mettiamo addosso ogni giorno.",

Nei periodi di ricaduta mi uscivano solo delle piccole chiazze rosse e fin quì tutto molto gestibile. Il fattaccio è iniziato solo quando ho raggiunto i 29 anni,dallo scoppio della pandemia. 15 giorni dalla seconda dose di moderna è iniziato il mio calvario con il prurito in testa,che fino a prima ( nonostante i miei vari problemi sin dalla nascita con dermatiti) non avevo mai avuto. Da allora sono stato in cura da molti dermatologi che sostengono che io ho un caso di dermatite seborroica. Ho fatto prove allergiche,provato shampoo,creme cortisoniche e lozioni a più non posso ma nulla è stato in grado di risolvere questo problema. Fortunatamente non ho problemi di caduta di capelli però ancora oggi non riesco a tamponare il problema,prurito che va e viene di continuo. Rossore e irritazioni credo,che non si curano né col sole,né evitando momenti di stress,ne con acqua di mare. Da un pò ho iniziato a lasciare qualsiasi prodotto ds e utilizzare solo shampoo idratanti. Chissà,spero davvero di venirne a capo,sono stanco di buttare soldi,ho cambiato 5 dermatologi e uno di loro mi ha tenuto in cura un anno senza arrivarne a capo.

Le case di dermocosmesi preferiscono tenere tutto vago per provare a vendere qualsiasi stupidaggine possibile.\n\nMi stavo chiedendo, il singolo individuo può fare qualcosa per contribuire a fare ricerca scientifica in questo ambito? Non sarà un problema grave come qualche rara malattia genetica, ma è sempre un problema che causa disagio a moltissime persone.",

Perché la dermatologa non si è sbilanciata, sto prendendo l'isotreinoina per acne lieve/medio sul viso, so che va prescritta per casi gravi ma nel mio caso va avanti da troppi anni e qualsiasi altra cura ha fallito. Preciso che la ds mi da problemi sul viso proprio nei punti dove ho più problemi di acne, per i capelli invece ho risolto con lo shampoo Kelual Ducray",

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp.

Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely lowered)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#

        "body": "Errors in your guide which even ChatGPT cannot correct. Hence why you should not use it as a personal doctor. Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‐term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system. J Dermatol. 2019;46(2):139-143. doi:10.1111/1346-8138.14719\n\n2) Yanagisawa M, Fujimaki H, Takeda A, Nemoto M, Sugimoto T, Sato A.

Journal of Dermatological Treatment. 2022;33(4):1938-1946. doi:10.1080/09546634.2021.1959506\n\nAnd here you go. This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R.

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nNélia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

If u confuse what clinical and cosmetical wait I can reduce ur confusion suppose a hair serum clinically regrow 5000 new hair then chat gpt repeat the same answe but in reality there are clincial growth and  in real life all people want cosmetics growth 📈 brother yes chat gpt is good for basic information but remind u chat gpt has no brain like human \n I also know 99 percent of derm are just want u to sell expensive treatment like prp , red laser etc etc expensive serum only 1 percent who really qualified and has vast knowledge give u honest answrs it's difficult to find such derm but by God grace I found that one although his appointment is not easy to get due to his international goodwill but somehow manage to get his appointment.

It is sometimes difficult to determine whether it’s psoriasis or dandruff or sebhorric dermatitis, my scalp feels different after applying specific shampoos, I am still not able to figure out what works for the flakes. I feel like scratching my head and have lost some hair and it became patchy on one side where I scratched. I don’t see hair follicles there and I am afraid it’s permanent. Not sure if that hair will come back, hope its a temporary hair loss.\nwhat should be the length of hair I should keep so that its easy for me to clean. I feel like going bald, so that atleast i know where the flakes are and I clean it properly.\n\nAlso what should be the length of hair one should keep optimal for applying all the above treatments like minoxidil, dermaroller. Is a normal dermaroller better or something like dermapen is useful. Can you use same dermaroller on face after cleaning.",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hi guys, hope all is well. I have been reading this thread for a while and decided it was time for me to sign up and get involved as I know 1st hand how mentally scarring this disease can be. I'll try not to babble on too much but I'll give a brief description of my experience with seb derm, followed by what I feel works & what you should/shouldn't do.\n\nI am a 32 year old male that lives in Manchester, England. Ive never had the best skin but first started having an issue with Seb Derm when I was about 28. I put this down to 1 of 2 things - I had my 1st tattoo when I was 28 & was due to get married later that year. I dont see any reason why having a tattoo would bring on seb derm but find it strange that it seemed to occur at approximately the same time. Probably just purely a coincidence but I dont know. I'd imagine the stress of arranging a wedding was a more mitigating factor. \n\nI have been diagnosed off 3 separate doctors & dermatologists that I have Seb Derm & having done my own research I am 100% certain this is the condition I have. I have a few small patches on my scalp and on my ears/around my nose, but the worst is on my forehead/t zone.\n\nIve tried all the shampoos and creams you can think of. You name it I've tried it. It's been that bad at times that I've actually cried. In my case, the condition seems to flare up alot worse in winter. Why, I have no idea but this seems to be the case for most people. However for the last 6 weeks or so I would describe myself as having this condition completely under control - for the 1st time in a long time - whether this is because of the routine I am about to go through with you, or because of the slightly warmer weather we are now having remains to be seen.\n\nThe 1st piece of advice I will give is this :- HOT WATER IS AN ABSOLUTE NO GO. I still have hot showers but do not touch my face or head with hot water. To wash my hair/face I only use cold water. In my experience it doesnt have to be freezing, just as long as it is \"cold\". Also do not spend too long in a hot shower as steam will go on your face & have a similar effect to hot water! I am not a doctor so I dont know exactly why this makes things 10 times worse, but for me it does, so dont do it.\n\nWhile in the shower, i use 2 antifungal shampoos together, literally - i squirt a small amount from 2 separate bottles of shampoo, lather up & leave on for 5/10 minutes. The shampoos I use are Tesco's own brand containing Zinc Pyrithione, and the other is Bioderma Node P shampoo, which contains Climbazole (1 of the only shampoos that contain this active ingredient). It is possible 1 of the shampoos could be working on its own but together they seem to be doing the job so dont want to tempt fate & risk a flare up! The Bioderma also contains Piroctone Olamine & Salylictic acid which is only a positive in my eyes. The more active ingredients the better. I do this EVERY MORNING. The reason behind me mixing these 2 shampoos is because I read an article on dandruff deconstructed that stated zinc & climbazole had proved to be highly successful when used together. And thus far I havnt been able to find a shampoo that contains both together so i literally just use 2 separate shampoos with those ingredients. I would also like to add that Ketaconazole and and a few other antifungal shampoos made my condition worse.\n\nAfter getting out the shower I try to dry my face & hair (I have normal length hair for a bloke) relatively quickly, mostly with a towel but also with a hairdryer because as we all know fungus loves moist environments. I do not scrub or rub hard, just gently but efficiently (this pressure also applies to how I apply the shampoo).\n\nHere in the UK I managed to get a bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar that contains raw honey (2 things people have had reasonable success with). I bought a squirty bottle & mixed the ACV & honey with water with a ratio of about 2:5. I also added abit of salt to the water which isnt going to do any harm. I squirt a tiny bit of the mixture onto my finger and rub in gently to the affected areas and let it dry. My face feels a little bit sticky due to the honey but in general its barely noticable. I do this 3 times a day - once just after the morning shower, once mid afternoon/tea time & once before bed. Might sound like a pain in the arse but it really isnt, literally takes me 10 seconds a time to do.\n\nMay I also just take this moment to stress that it's important not to use ingredients that are too strong for your skin. I understand it can be tempting to buy super strong shampoos or use ACV neat to try & \"kill\" the fungus, but unless you have skin like a rhino this is more likely to do more harm than good. \n\nThen finally, 1 more thing I admit I need to use in my routine - steroid cream. Yeah I know what you're thinking, but bare with me. It appears everyone is scared to death (myself included) of using these creams on the face in fear of thinning skin. If you actually read up on steroid creams you will find it is highly unlikely to suffer thinning skin unless you go absolutely over the top with it. What I have found is that my routine seems to work for about 4/5 days (depending on the weather or if I've been on the piss), and then I feel certain areas of my face/scalp are starting to become a little bit itchy, or the ACV starts to sting abit more than usual. This is when I use steroid cream to \"keep it at bay\". I use eumovate on my face once (yes you can use this on your face) and a slightly stronger 1 (betacap) on my scalp. The way I see it, you're better off using steroid cream once a week to keep it at bay, than not at all and have a horrendous flare up and have to use it twice a day for a week/10 days straight. If you are currently going through a bad flare up, just use the damn steroid cream to get it down. I have accepted that this is a lifelong condition that will not go away and I simply have to manage it. If using steroid cream once a week enables me to do so then so be it.\n\nI also recommend sun exposure. I feel going on the sunbed once every 10 days - 2 weeks has benefitted me. I wouldnt go on anymore than that due to fears of skin cancer/ageing but I am completely comfortable going on 2/3 times a month. Everything in moderation & all that. Having a slight tan will also make any unwanted redness less noticable. \n\nI do not use any moisturizers of any sort. I feel moisturizers along with oils made my skin 10 times worse. It completely baffles me when people appear/claim to have had success with oils in particular.\n\nI have tried changing my diet with no success. As a lad who likes my grub I personally found it unrealistic trying to cut out dairy/gluten as some have suggested.\n\nI also take an anti-histamine everyday - this should definitely help with any itchiness. I also take a zinc & vitamin D tablet every morning - I'm not convinced they do much to be honest, but they are certainly not going to do any harm. \n\nQuick word on Vitamin D - i am of the opinion that Vitamin D does have some part to play in this horrible condition - otherwise why would it flare up worse in the colder months? Interesting topic of debate that i think has been discussed in here before.\n\nSo to sum up :-\n\nNO HOT WATER\n\nShampoo with zinc & climbazole\n\nDry well\n\nACV/honey/salt water mix\n\nSteroid cream once a week or so\n\nSunbed\n\nAnti-histamine/zinc/vit D tablets\n\nAvoid moisturizers & oils \n\nI'm sure this routine won't work for some. Im not entirely convinced myself yet that it isn't just a change in the weather that's helped my seb derm. But since I started doing it 6 weeks ago I've been practically seb derm free for the 1st time in God knows how long so I'm going to stick with it. I know how badly this horrible disease can affect your self esteem so if just 1 person can take a few positives from this post and be in a better position to deal with it then job done. \n\nHappy to answer any questions\n\nPeace out guys, cheers for reading",

You are aware that sebderm is lifelong, but at the same time you are still endorsing steroid? Lifelong, steroid. It is just not sustainable for something that is already lifelong and has so many variables to bring it back into inflammation. And before you accuse me of mere fearmongering, i do end up with thin skin just by using steroid the way my dr prescribed it to me (only one month and never again, but thin skin still haunts me until about a year later). I could live with only thin skin, but that came with the package of itchy atopic dermatitis and weeping episodes to the point i had to quit my job since life is impossible when your face and neck wont stop oozing smelly shit. And that is just topical aspect of the side effect. The least important effect. Unless you cover all the variables, you cant guarantee your use of steroid wont be \"that much\". Lifelong, again. Yes the search can be draining, but choosing steroid over your organs is like cutting off your nose to spite the face. As you said, you know you have to maintain a routine since this lifelong, so why not choose a routine that is sustainable? \n\nOn the rest of your lifestyle change, you seemed to have a vague idea of what's working, so if you are interested to read more, please have a look on Dr. Jack Kruse on leaky gut syndrome. Or just Dr Kruse 's view on sun and vitamin d alone. It's easy to relate the cause and effect just from your background story to Dr Kruse's guide. Basically he endorsed people to fix such problem by fixing our diet and embracing the sun (an obvious caveat is not to get sunburn). We are more prone to fungus attack (like itchiness and sebderm) when we have poor gut health and low vitamin d level. He also suggested the use of antioxidants such as glutathione and vitamin c for such problem, but i honestly didnt read that part since i end up already following eczema publications that also suggested the very same thing.",

I bought a tub of coal tar ointment and it basically cleared up my whole face overnight...it was nothing short of amazing!  I was scared to use it at first bc it is an ointment and looks similar to Vaseline. Any oils I had attempted to use in the past only made things worse. I was worried I would wake up with a very angry face, but I was thrilled!  It took 20 years, but I finally found something that works. I know everyone is different and what works for one may not work for another, but if you haven’t tried coal tar yet I would suggest it. I bought a tub of this:\n     *MG217 Psoriasis extra strength 2% coal tar formula. It’s a 4oz tub and costs about $5 at any drug store. There are coal tar shampoos, lotions, and ointments. I have the ointment bc I get my sebderm on my face...looks like an angry goatee when I have a flare up. The only downside is the smell...it doesn’t smell great. I think it smells like a mechanic’s shop, or an “industrial” smell. However, it is not so bad that it makes me gag or anything...and I don’t notice the smell after having it on for a bit. My husband doesn’t smell it when laying next to me either, so it’s not overwhelming by any means. Plus, if it means clear skin with no itch, pain, flaking, or oozing, I’m all in!  I hope this helps someone...sebderm is the absolute worst! Especially when you can’t find anything that helps. There were times when I didn’t want to leave the house bc it was so bad. I was so happy to finally find something that worked...just wish I could have found it sooner!",

I saw that other users here on /r/sebderm have had success trying it out so I ordered it home and I really feel its helping. For some reason it's a bit drying on my forehead which makes my wrinkles more noticeable but I don't have my sebderm there so I try to not use it there. But anyways, it's a good creme to keep the sebderm at bay, I'd suggest you try it out if you haven't already. Also search for others trying it here on /r/sebderm and see what they wrote. I don't think it's a cure but it's a perfectly fine way to 'treat' the sebderm. I try to use it everyday.\n\nSecondly when I feel like my skin is getting dry you might think I want to use a moisturizer, but yeah, that's right, we got sebderm, so we have to be very careful which moisturizer we use so we don't aggravate the sebderm. I've probably tried a hundred different moisturizers (or more) but I've finally found a winner:\nAvene Extreme Tolerance Emulsion. I found it on https://simpleskincarescience.com (which is a fantastic blog if you have sebderm or any other related skin problems). It helps keeping my skin moisturized when I feel dry, it won't break me out and it won't aggravate the sebderm.\n\nI'm also gonna try Tom Busby's climbazole lotion (mentioned [here](https://sv.reddit.com/r/SebDerm/comments/a35w8c/tom_busbys_climbazole_lotion/?st=jphmu8hm&sh=6df33c52)) you should check out his stuff on rosaceagroup.org and his contributions to research on sebderm.\n\nOh, also not eating cereal with milk to breakfast helps with my sebderm (although I can eat bread with cheese, lol, the human body is weird)\n\nSo that's my 2 cents of my sebderm right now. Looking forward to trying Tom's lotion and if it doesn't work out I'm pretty much OK with the Avene products but I'll always be scouting for more things against the sebderm ;). Will update when I try Tom's lotion",

        "body": "Commenting here since every post i made with description was removed by mods somehow for reasons unknown to me.\n\nI'm 27 y/o & this is my MPB experience.\n\nMy Long story :\n\nI  started gradually lossing my hair in mid 2018. At that time i was  clueless about MPB & its treatement. I always had a short haircut  & it masked the loss that had started at the time. My barber even  told me that my hair is getting thinner & i didn't gave it any  thought other than improving my haircare regime.\n\nFor  2 years i grew my hair long till i had around 20 inch long. Eventually i  cut it & for a good cause of donating to a cancer charity. The  thing is that i didn't grew my hair for donating it but rather i had  developed so much social anxiety that i coundn't think of going for a  haircut. I was severely depressed at that point of time in my life &  my whole personality changed from an extroverted jolly person to  introverted anti social person. During this 2 year period my long hair  made the hair loss look mild since i always pulled it back and created a  bun. i never bothered to look at the top of my hair & from the  front it looked ok to me (eventhough in reality it had recessed severely  and aside from the long strands of hair my scalp looked bald).\n\nin  mid 2021 i got covid & it fast tracked my hairloss & i finally  started noticing it. I researched everything about it & go to learn  about tressless through it. I learned about the treatement. at this time  i learned that all 3 brothers of my mom had gone top bald with sides in  their early 30s.\n\ni thought of  starting treatment But a year went by & i never acted on it. I was  again infected by covid after mid 2022 & this was a devastating one  as it literally made me go bald. i started losing patches of strong long  hair daily. Now i had become very self aware about my appearance. I  finally bought finasteride 1mg to start but i was afraid of the side  effects it may cause & also i never had consulted with a doctor  about it. So, i started using Onion hair Oil, Bringha hair oil &  expensive shampoos,conditioners in hopes of reducing the loss for the  most part. i kept doing this till june 2023. in july i moved to a city  & finally gathered the courage to go visit a doctor about it.\n\nThe  doctor prescribed me the two most proven treatment for this i.e.  Finasteride 1mg (night)+ Minoxidil 5% + Finasteride 0.1% topical  solution (night) & on top of that he gave me Vitamin D3 60k IU  weekly, Multivitamin (biotin 10mg,Soya isoflavone), Kera XL hair growth  serum (morning), procapil shampoo twice weekly. my vitamin d level was  low visible by dark circles near eyes so i get the reuirement. i have  done GFC (better prp) every month till now & he has suggested  increasing the gap from a month to 4 months to 8 months to every one  year for maintainance. He has also talked to me about a new way to stop  fin and minoxidil without losing the progress. i am skeptical but he has  published a few studies of his own in past. i also had talked about  using ketoconazole 2% with him & he suggested using  Climbazole+Piroctone Olamine shampoo as it is a better at everything  than ketoconazole while having lesser side effects like hair colour  change & dryness. So, i have used keto 2% for two months now once  weekly & have added Climbazole+Piroctone Olamine once weekly too.\n\nOne  more thing i want to say is that i have gained enough condidence to go  outside without wearing a cap & have joined Gym to improve on myself  & get over my anxiety by interacting socially.\n\nThis  community has helped me immensely in believing getting better by the  means available right now instead of going bald advice i see on a  particular youtube channel & bald subreddit. i am just 27 & i  looked like i was in my mid 40s & the bald head only looks good on  some people. i woud look like a baby face lesbian lol\n\nLastly  i want some advice for my receded temples. i have tried minoxidil 5%+  tritinoin 0.01% specially at that area for over 1.5 month but aside from  small hairs growing it has not given me good results.\n\ni am thinking of microneedling by derma roller,stamp or pen. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nalso i got my vitamin d levels checked & it was at 80ng/mL. after that i reduced it to D3 1000 IU daily.\n\nShould i also get my testosterone level check ?",

Also i am kinda worried that there are around two ketoconazole products, even tho i told her i have used the gel before and didnt work on me. Now she told me i have to leave it on for a longer time. Apart from that, it seems like a solid treatment. This is the routine:\n\nFor the face:\n\n- Wash with Ketopan mousse (contains climbazole+piroctone olamine) once a day for 3 days. Then once every other day for maintenance\n\n- Apply Ketoderm twice a day for 1 month (it's a 2% ketoconazole cream)\n\n- Locapred (corticoid cream) from the 3rd day of using Ketoderm, apply once a day on skin lessions for 10 days\n\n- Use Kelual DS crème as a daily moisturizer, twice a day\n\n- Take zinc supplements once a day for 3 months\n\nFor the head:\n\n- Wash with normal shampoo, then apply 2% ketoconazole gel, leave on for 10 min. Do this for a month\n\n- Use a solution made up by a pharmacy that contains: kelual emulsion, mycoster spray (1% ciclopirox olamine), skinosalic lotion. Use this once a day for a month, to spray on all my scalp, then once every other day for a month, then twice a week as maintenance\n\n- Kelual DS shampoo. This could be optional i think. Once a week\n\nEdit: if anyone has a cheaper recommendation for the kelual DS moisturizer and shampoo, that would be great!",

    "body": "**Introduction**  \nTom Busby is a guy over at the forum [rosaceagroup.org](https://rosaceagroup.org/). He has researched skin conditions, mainly seborrheic dermatitis and malasezzia related skin conditions, for years and he has cured his life long condition through his homemade lotions and cleansers. Through the years he has shared his recipes and research on the forums, mainly in his own thread where he goes over different treatments and his own experiences: [Link](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia) The whole thread is worth a read\n\nNow that he has years of experimenting and experience behind him he doesn't believe his formulas will change, and he has also started selling his products. You can contact him through email or wait until he sets up his own website to sell his products, which he said will happen in a couple of months.\n\nEach product cost 35$ + shipping. I've been using them for just over a week, not really long enough to write a proper review, so this is more of a first impressions post. I'll try to keep it pretty brief, so just ask questions below if you want to know anything.\n\n**The Lotion**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Niacinamide & dl-Panthenol (proVitamins), Glycerin, Olive Squalane oil, Cetearyl alcohol 30/70 NF (thickener), Sodium Hyaluronate, HMW, & Ceramide complex, (skin quality improve-ment), Ceteareth 20 & Glyceryl stearate (emulsifiers), Toco-phersolan & Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Climbazole (anti-fungal), Microcrystalline wax, OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, & Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nA ton of great ingredients, climbazole working as an antifungal and piroctone olamine working as an antifungal and also against demodex. No oils which malasezzia can metabolize and also a ton of other great ingredients for general skin improvement.\n\nThe lotion is a bit runny, which makes it very easy to spread across the face. It's a bit oily at first,  but it soaks great into the skin and dries pretty matte. It has no perfume, it smells a bit of alcohol. It isn't as moisturizing as for example cerave cream or other rich moisturizer, but it works great for my skin. Thick moisturizer makes my skin all shiny and breaks me out, this leaves my skin feeling like I am wearing nothing. I've tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and even without thinking about the antifungals, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried. I just need a little bit to cover my entire face and because of the large bottle this will probably last for months.\n\n**The shampoo**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Decyl glucoside, Cocobetaine, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium lauryol lactylate, (surfactants), Niacinamide and dl-Panthenol (pro-Vitamins), Olive Squalane oil, Sodium hyaluronate, HMW, and Ceramide complex, (skin quality improvement), Tocophersolan and Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Acrylates C10-30 cross-polymer, Climbazole (anti-fungal), Citric acid, Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate (solubilizer), OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Methylene blue, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, and Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nThis also contains a ton of great ingredients and no bad oils. I just use it as a foaming facial cleanser. It foams up pretty well, and it has a low pH. Because it is a foaming cleanser it is a bit drying, so using it without the moisturizer is probably a bad idea.\n\n**How to use and results**  \nReading Tom's posts at the forums he has some guidelines on how to use the products. Once a day I wet my face in the sink, then I foam up the cleanser and rub it into my face. Then i wait a few minutes and step into the shower and properly rinse it of. When i step out of the shower i tap-dry my face and apply the lotion on my face.\n\nFrom the first day my face started to shed dead skin. A lot of white flakes appeared on the center of my face and beard area. This might sound worrying, but according to Tom this is great. He is an older guy, so it took him over 5 months for his skin to return to normal, but because I am pretty young I should expect faster results. My skin seems to get less flaky every day, and i just rub the flakes of with my fingers and apply more moisturizer if they are visible.\n\nMy skin is less red and the products also seem to work well for my acne. It remains to be seen how the products work long term, but right now I am happy to have a solid routine that should kill of the fungus on my face causing my seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0acvbn1a1721.jpg?width=3336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d824cd13feea43386925fe49c5793cb62db4cb6c",

        "body": "Great thorough review SelectAge.\n\nI bought the lotion and shampoo at the same time as SelectAge (after SelectAges post here on /r/sebderm that Tom had started selling it) and have also been using it for a week. At first I noticed, just like SelectAge, my skin flaking but also my face turned red. But both of these symptoms are supposed to be good since it is a natural reaction for your skin as the skin is fighting the sebderm. After a couple of days my skin has gotten less and less red and flaky. \n\nI'm also pretty young (27) so I expect my skin to react faster than Tom's did. Also he added an ingredient since he used it that he thinks may make it 25% faster than it was for him.\n\nMy routine is just like SelectAge, I mostly use it for my face, but sometimes I use the shampoo for my hair/top body as well but I don't use it often enough to review how good it works on my scalp. It doesn't bug me as much as the sebderm on my face.\n\nAs SelectAge said, it is a good idea to use the shampoo as a cleanser before applying the moisturizer to thoroughly cleanse your skin before putting on the lotion.\n\nIt feels like I am just repeating everything SelectAge has said already, but I will also keep updating how it goes for me. Hopefully I will know for sure in just a month or two if it going in the right direction for me:)\n\nIf you are interested in this product I'd suggest you read up a lot on Tom's research and then contact Tom on either the forum or through his mail which I think is accessible through his post which is posted on 4th of december in the forum thread which SelectAge linked. He has a 'product information file' which he sent me so I'd suggest you ask Tom for it if you are interested. I don't want to share it here without asking Tom so I'd suggest you just ask Tom for it:)\n\nHopefully we'll both get better and better SelectAge *hopeful*",

When you start using an anti-fungal the immune system becomes aware of the fungal invaders and the symptoms flare up. After around 10 days of treatment the flaking is now very minimal, but redness, especially in the inner cheek region, which in first seemed to decrease, is now a bit worse. I have been kind of scrubbing the shampoo into my face, so I am going to try applying it a bit more gently in case the redness is just normal skin irritation.   \n\n\nI've experienced the same increase in redness when using antifungals like lotrimin ultra and terbinafine previously, so I am not really worried, and still optimistic about the treatment. The initial increase in flaking should be an indication that the product is working, an increase in redness is also to be expected. Curious to see if the redness will eventually fade.",

'Paraben' isn't harsh either, it has been demonized effectively but actually parabens are among the safest preservatives for cosmetics. \n\nFor me personally, piroctone olamine works very well.

He's planning on starting a sale-website in a few months, but if you're interested in buying them you can contact him on email on  [busbylaw@cox.net](mailto:busbylaw@cox.net)\n\nYou can also wait a few weeks and I will give my feedback on the products, I am of course very sceptical, but looking at the ingredients the products look promising.\n\nRegarding the esters in the product, Tom had the following to say:\n\n>There’s **one** guy who started the claim that esters are metabolized by malassezia.  No one has ever tested his theory.  There aren’t any scientific articles to back up his claims.  I think he’s trying to drive traffic to his websites by making wild claims.  He’s mostly repeating the science I found and reported at the rosacea-forum.  He sometimes gives me credit, by name, but I don’t encourage him at all.  Bad science is really irritating to me.  \n>  \n>Here’s my reasoning:\n\n1. The esters at issue are not found in nature.\n2. Malassezia has evolved to consume oils found in nature, like the oils on mammals and in plants, fruits, nuts, and seeds.\n3. The fact that esters have a carbon chain is meaningless.  Malassezia eats oils, not carbon by itself.  Otherwise you’d find malassezia inside of coal mines and oil wells, but you don’t.\n4. I have no reaction to esters, and I have very sensitive skin that’s likely to develop malassezia-problems, very quickly. \n5. If the one guy making wild claims about esters would simply test them on himself, he’d easily see he’s wrong.",

This could also be related to the fact that I've eaten a lot of shit during christmas, and also have not changed pillow cases as often as i used to, but for the first time in months, and in a bigger scale than I can remember ever having, i broke out with acne all over my cheeks. On both sides of my cheeks I developed around 10-20 small whiteheads / red bumps. I also developed some minor acne on my nose, and chin. As expected the products also resulted in a lot of flaking and dryness, which should be a sign that the product is working, but that in conjunction with an outbreak of acne led me to ditch the products. My skin has never liked moisturizers and cleansers, they seem to always lead to me breaking out, and i believe they have also contributed to my seb derm spreading and becoming worse, especially the ones which are not safe for fungal skin.

The user reports in the internet (and I mean mainly rosaceagroup.org) report almost all better results then with Kataconazol. Only problem with Climbazole is that AFAIK you can not really buy OTC products in USA, because the FDA did not allow it's use (or made no rules I think -> not allowed to sell products with it), but there is no problem in importing the things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that makes System 4 Clibmazole Scalp Tonic so interesting for me is not just climbazole (other active is piroctone olamine) , but it is a leave on product (what is much much better then a rinse product like a shampoo) & for me doesn't make my scalp dry, like many shampoos do & the hair do not look oily after applying & is easy to apply. So you can wash your hair with a really mild shampoo (e.g. a baby shampoo that is Malassezia safe without heavy sulfates, I now ordered  Bioderma ABCDerm Shampoo, hope i will get it today). The only bad thing is it really doesn't smell very good. And that you do not know the concentrations of the actives, but climbazole & piroctone olamine is effective in really really small amounts when it is a leave on product, so probably there will be enough in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI plan to use this Tonic every day till all the Malassezia is gone on my scalp, then just every-some-days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way the whole line does look not so bad, with a lot of different products for different types of hair/scalp: [https://sim.fi/en-system4](https://sim.fi/en-system4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly I don't know how you guys in America order this the best, I am from Austria and ordered from nicebeauty.com. In Europe it should not be such a big problem, it is a company from Finnland.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Polyquaternium-28, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Climbazole, Piroctone Olamine, Salicylic Acid, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Propylene Glycol, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Menthol\n\nSo also Salicylic Acid for exfoliation.

Also, you need to use Malassezia safe shampoo, face wash, and SPF. Put this solution in a bottle that squeezes out nicely onto your scalp and massage it in.\n\nWith the ingredients you’ve collected, we can create a highly effective liquid serum targeting fungal overgrowth, itching, and flaking caused by Malassezia. Below is a custom formula for a Calming Seborrheic Serum:\n\n\n---\n\nIngredients and Functions\n\n1. Tea Tree Oil – Potent antifungal and anti-inflammatory.\n\n\n2. Grapefruit Seed Extract – Antimicrobial, helps reduce fungal growth.\n\n\n3. Powdered Xylitol – Discourages Malassezia yeast growth.\n\n\n4. Rosemary Essential Oil – Antifungal, improves circulation, and soothes irritation.\n\n\n5. 99% Aloe Vera Gel – Hydrates, soothes inflammation, and serves as a base.\n\n\n6. Liquid Colloidal Silver (250ppm) – Antimicrobial, reduces skin irritation.\n\n\n7. MCT Oil Powder – Lightweight, hydrating without feeding Malassezia.\n\n\n8. Apple Cider Vinegar – Balances scalp pH to inhibit fungal growth.\n\n\n9. Black Seed Oil – Antimicrobial, reduces inflammation, and nourishes the skin.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n50ml Liquid Serum Formula\n\n1. Base:\n\n20ml Aloe Vera Gel (hydration, soothing)\n\n10ml Colloidal Silver (antimicrobial base)\n\n5ml Apple Cider Vinegar (pH balancing, antifungal)\n\n\n\n2. Actives:\n\n3-4 drops Tea Tree Oil (antifungal)\n\n3-4 drops Rosemary Essential Oil (antifungal, calming)\n\n1ml Grapefruit Seed Extract (antimicrobial boost)\n\n1/4 tsp Powdered Xylitol (inhibits yeast; dissolve first)\n\n\n\n3. Lipids:\n\n2ml Black Seed Oil (anti-inflammatory, nourishing)\n\n2ml MCT Oil Powder (hydration and lightweight emollience)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nPreparation Steps\n\n1. Dissolve Xylitol: Mix the powdered xylitol in a small amount (2-3ml) of warm colloidal silver or aloe vera gel to ensure it dissolves completely.\n\n\n2. Combine Base Ingredients: In a clean mixing bowl, combine the aloe vera gel, colloidal silver, and apple cider vinegar. Stir gently.\n\n\n3. Add Actives: Add tea tree oil, rosemary oil, grapefruit seed extract, and the dissolved xylitol solution to the base. Mix well.\n\n\n4. Incorporate Lipids: Add black seed oil and MCT oil powder into the mixture. Stir or shake the mixture well to emulsify (you may notice slight separation; this is normal for oil/water blends).\n\n\n5. Transfer to Bottle: Using a funnel, pour the mixture into a clean glass dropper bottle (50ml). Shake thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nShake the serum well before each use to re-emulsify the ingredients.\n\nApply 5-10 drops directly to your scalp, focusing on affected areas.\n\nGently massage into the scalp.\n\nUse 1-2 times daily or as needed.\n\n\n\n---\n\nStorage\n\nStore the serum in a cool, dark place.\n\nWithout added preservatives, the serum will last about 2-3 weeks if handled properly.\n\nIf you want longer shelf life, add a natural preservative like Optiphen Plus (0.5-1%) or refrigerate the serum.\n\n\n\n---\n\nKey Notes\n\n1. pH Balance: Apple cider vinegar keeps the formula acidic (pH ~4.5-5.5), which helps prevent Malassezia overgrowth.\n\n\n2. Patch Test: Always perform a patch test before use to ensure no sensitivity to essential oils or other ingredients.\n\n\n3. Customizations: If the formula feels too oily or too acidic, you can reduce the oil quantities or dilute the apple cider vinegar slightly.\n\n\nHere are some additional ingredients that could enhance the formula's effectiveness and match the goals of a soothing, antifungal serum for seborrheic dermatitis:\n\n\n---\n\nAdditional Ingredients to Consider\n\n1. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)\n\nAnti-inflammatory, reduces redness, and strengthens the skin barrier.\n\nDosage: 2-5% of the total formula.\n\n\n\n2. Panthenol (Provitamin B5)\n\nSoothing and hydrating, promotes healing of irritated skin.\n\nDosage: 1-3%.\n\n\n\n3. Zinc PCA\n\nAntifungal, sebum-regulating, and soothing.\n\nDosage: 0.5-1%.\n\n\n\n4. Climbazole\n\nA strong antifungal specifically effective against Malassezia.\n\nDosage: 0.1-0.5%.\n\n\n\n5. Squalane\n\nA lightweight, non-comedogenic oil that hydrates without feeding fungal growth.\n\nDosage: Add a few drops if the formula feels too drying.\n\n\n\n6. Cucumber Extract\n\nSoothing and hydrating, helps with inflammation and irritation.\n\nDosage: 5-10%.\n\n\n\n7. Green Tea Extract\n\nAntioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nDosage: 3-5%.\n\n\n\n8. Vitamin E (Tocopherol)\n\nAntioxidant that protects the formula and soothes the skin.\n\nDosage: 0.5-1%.\n\n\n\n9. Sulfur (Colloidal or Precipitated)\n\nAntifungal and keratolytic, effective for severe flaking.\n\nDosage: 2-5% (must be used carefully due to odor and skin sensitivity).\n\n\n\n10. Glycerin or Propanediol\n\nHumectants that add hydration without feeding fungus.\n\nDosage: 2-5%.",

My SD journey has been quite long - started with the typical ketaconozle/coal tar shampoos, moved onto coconut oil (horrible decision as it feed the yeast), raw honey, dead sea salt, EVERYTHING. I have mild face/chest seb derm, moderate scalp Seb derm. \n\nI've been researching Tom Busby on the Rosacea Forums. This dude has been compounding his own shampoos and lotions for a few years now and has fully kept his severe SD at bay. He praises climbazole, an antifungal unavailable OTC in North America. Please read through the numerous threads and his PDFs on climbazole - this is quite a few hours of reading material but has greatly helped my understanding of Seb derm.\n\nhttps://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia\n\nI am currently following his advice, using E45 shampoo to wash my scalp/face/chest, and using MCT oil as a safe moisturizer. I will be compounding climbazole I've purchased off eBay into the MCT oil shortly once I have a scale and beaker. This option obviously isn't accessible as we're not all chemists, but it's been important for me to learn the science behind climbazole so I can fully embrace it as treatment.\n\nMy skin is improving greatly with just the shampoo, which apparently has a very low quanitity of climbazole. It's only been two weeks, however, so I'll have to wait it out to see how well it works in the long run, coupled with the more effective MCT oil/climbazole moisturizer I'll be compounding soon. \n\nDo any of you use climbazole or have used it in the past? Why is this not being discussed more frequently in this sub? Apparently it's much more effective as an antifungal than ketaconozle, but depending on your age and severity of SD, it can take 6+ months to fully rid all biofilm layers. I'm willing to commit to this timeframe to see if the climbazole works.\n\nLet me know what you all think. This might just be the solution we're looking for. The science makes sense. I'm ready to make this condition more manageable and avoid all flare ups.",

I've tried every routine, brand and ingredients, but only ever see minimal results.\n\nI used to have typical spots like whiteheads, which is doing a lot better now. But now I stuggle with small bumps all over my skin. They are usually the colour of my skin but get very red when I wash my face. My cheeks also tend to be itchy. Because of this I suspect I could have fungal acne.\n\nMy skincare routine right now is:\nRound lab mugwort calming cleanser\nSkin 1004 centella poremizing ampoule\nPurito oat-in calming gel cream\n(All of which are apparently fungal acne safe)\nI also use the boj red bean mask and aqua fresh sunscreen but haven't been using either until I figure this out\n\nI began trying to wash my face with anti dandruff shampoo to see if it would help. I don't have any that contain ketoconazole where I am so I'm using one that contains climbazole (umberto giannini scalp restore) I might get head and shoulders if I don't see a difference. I also found a tube of lamisil cream that's not really for your face but it has anti fungal properties so I'm trying that too! 😭\n\nIg I'm mostly wondering if this does seem like fungal acne, and if so what can I change/do to make it better? Doctors and impossible where I am when it comes to skin and it will be a long time until I can see a derm, so any advice I can do in the meantime would mean a lot. I'm not fully sure what's causing it since the products I'm using at the moment are supposed to be safe. I've always had bad skin texture and bumps but it seems to be since I had an allergic reaction afew weeks ago that it's been this bad, it's more apparent than ever right now.\n\nI just want my skin to be smooth for the first time 🙏 Thank you so much for reading this far !",

So using mct oil is good, but make sure to clean your face properly with sebderm appropriate stuff before putting it (you can check product ingredients in the website sezia.co)\nAfter a while now I can even go close to 24 hours without putting anything on or taking a shower and the sebderm doesn't return (haven't tried longer yet). I think after a while of a good cleaning routine you would be able to do it less frequently. Also, try rotating types of c8 mct oils and face cleansers for variety.\n\nRegarding the scalp, I use the classic head and shoulders shampoo once a day (one shower without shampoo), and put the oil at night about once every 2-3 days (in the beginning I used it more frequently).

    "body": "Hi all, thanks for the invite to this sub. \n\nBella was a Boston Terrier that suffered from allergies her entire life.  She passed away on March 1, 2021, from heart failure at 11.5 years old.\n\nAt about a year of age, Bella started to have greasy, itchy red skin.  We went to several vets for a diagnosis, at first they thought it was a parasite (mange), all tests came back negative.  She was initially treated for bacterial and yeast skin infections, they reoccurred several times. Then we realized we were dealing with allergies. Our vet first started her on Apoquel which worked to ease her redness but her skin never really cleared up without antibiotics and sometimes steroids.  When Cytopoint was released, we immediately tried it. Cytopoint is a shot that changes the immune response.  Within a few hours, she finally had relief from her itchy skin.  We continued the Cytopoint shots every 6 weeks, along with Apoquel in the spring and summer.  We could back off a little in the winter months (we live in Iowa) she did much better when the ground was covered with snow.  If we missed her shot she would often end up with a bad skin infection, so we would put her back on antibiotics, it got to the point that only one antibiotic was working and it was the expense one (Clavamox).  This cycle continued for years. \n\nOur vet suggested allergy testing, but we never followed through.  We assumed she was \"too old\" at that point, but then she lives on for several more years.  In the end, we regretted that choice.\n\nWe tried all types of dog foods, from allergy foods to high protein foods.  We supplemented with fish oils and yogurt, nothing ever made a difference. \n\nShe did best when we gave her medicated baths ([https://www.1800petmeds.com/Malaseb+Shampoo-prod10667.html](https://www.1800petmeds.com/Malaseb+Shampoo-prod10667.html)) weekly, used a medicated foam ([https://www.amazon.com/Ceva-DOU07146-Chlorhexidine-Climbazole-Mousse/dp/B07B17MW4M](https://www.amazon.com/Ceva-DOU07146-Chlorhexidine-Climbazole-Mousse/dp/B07B17MW4M)) to kill yeast and had regular shots.  When we kept up this regimen, we had the best luck.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions.  My lab also has some minor skin allergies, but the topical foam clears them right up.",

    "body": "Hi everyone, I took your advice and used ChatGPT to narrow down the best dandruff shampoos. Based on what I learned, I decided to go with Scalpe Pro Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, but I also looked into Ketomac 2% Shampoo as a stronger alternative in case I needed it.\n\nSince I didn’t think my dandruff was that severe, I went with Scalpe Pro first. If it didn’t work, I could always try Ketomac, which is stronger but meant for more severe cases.\n\n\n\n**The Two Shampoos I Considered**\n\n• Scalpe Pro Anti-Dandruff Shampoo (Climbazole + Zinc Pyrithione)\n\nA gentler option for mild to moderate dandruff. Works by controlling scalp oil production and preventing fungal growth without being too harsh. Can be used 2-3 times a week without excessive dryness.\n\n• Ketomac 2% Shampoo (Ketoconazole 2%)\n\nOne of the strongest medicated dandruff shampoos, usually recommended for severe, stubborn dandruff or fungal scalp infections. Has a stronger antifungal effect than Scalpe Pro but can be drying. Should be used only once a week or as prescribed.\n\n\n\n**How I Used Scalpe Pro**\n\n🔹 Step 1: Dilution\n\nI took around 1 spoon of the shampoo and diluted it with about ½ cup of water. (I didn’t measure exactly, so this is just an estimate.)\n\n🔹 Step 2: Scalp Application\n\nI applied the diluted shampoo using a cotton pad to ensure even distribution on my scalp. The instructions recommended leaving it for 10 minutes, but I got caught up with some work and left it on for about 25 minutes instead.\n\n🔹 Step 3: Washing It Out\n\nI used the leftover solution as a regular shampoo during my shower, applying and massaging it into my scalp like I normally would.\n\n\n\n**Results After First Wash**\n\n• My scalp is completely dandruff-free!\n\n• No more build-up – my scalp feels clean and fresh.\n\n• I’ll be using it just once more to make sure everything is fully gone.\n\nThanks again to everyone who helped me with this!",

I tells me that I should be using it everyday for the first week and 2 times a week after that. I live in Scandinavia, and zinc in shampoo is not wide spread, so the reason why it works well might be because it's my first time using it. But it might work well because it combines multiple active ingredients which the fungi have a harder time to fight off. If I added some keto to that routine it might even before more effective and starve it off more so I don't have to use it as frequently or the shampoo loosing its effect.

    "body": "I thought I'd offer my own experience of seb derm over the last year or so and also ask general advice.\nI'm 26 M and just over a year ago I realized I was scratching the top of my head a lot. Then someone pointed out to me that my hair was quite thin on top. This was when I realized I might have seb derm. I was getting lots of scalyness/scabs and itchyness on the top plus little pimple like bumps. \n\nI went to the doctor and he prescribed a coal-tar shampoo.  I tried it for a few weeks (2-3) but I only found that it treated the dandruff and that it was a little harsh on my scalp, I'd still get itching and other symptoms. \n\nI went back to the doctor and they suggest I try a Ketoconazole shampoo. I tried this for around a month or so. I found that it helped a little, but was also quite harsh and caused more flaking and redness. \n\nI had some mild success using using a oilatum shampoo, active ingredient being  Ciclopirox Olamine. I used this once or twice a week, this calmed the symptoms down around 40%. At this point I started shaving my head completely due to hair loss. I believe my hair loss is mostly down to MPB but my GF is convinced its related to my seb derm, I personally think its a combination of the two. \n\nCurrently, I am using E45 shampoo once or twice a week (Every 3rd or 4th day?) active ingredient being Climbazole I believe. I'm also trying to only wash with warm water rather than hot. Symptoms are a lot better than they have been, but I still get bumps that come and go, some scalyness and sometimes itching, but not nearly as bad as before. I'd say my symptoms are around 50-60% less than this time last year. I've also recently started taking Vitamin D supplements just as a general health choice, not high dose though. \n\nI've realized that the symptoms flare up based on a few things. I think food is related, possibly sugar and carbs but I'm not really sure. I don't drink milk, and have only a little dairy. It definitely flares up with hot water and also itches if I wear a hat or hood. \n\nI have an appointment with a dermatologist in the next month at a hospital so I'm hoping that might at least confirm a few things. I'm not really sure what questions I have other than: What foods have people had success with eliminating? And if you have any tips thats also great. \n\nTL:DR I have (probably MPB) and seb derm, tried several products over the last year, had some success with E45 shampoo and avoiding hot water. I have flare ups which I think are connected to diet but not sure what in diet. ",

Your westie likely has at least one environmental allergy and food allergy - it goes with the breed - and the longer you wait to see a specialist the worse it will get. You're doing the right things but it won't be enough.  A vet can do skin cytologys/cultures, checking under the microscrope to look for bacteria and yeast and prescribe antibiotics and a type of steroid if needed to get her skin to calm down.  \n\nChanging foods is good but it can 6-12 months to see any improvement - or no improvement and then it may be time to change to another food (your vet should advise you not to change it too often and to do so gradually).   Go for the foods with limited ingredients, such as Blue Buffalo's limited ingredient option.  And when you change it would be to another protein.  We went from chicken to buffalo to salmon to rabbit (prescription), most of them with potato.  \n\nA half tablet of Benadryl works to help calm them but is only a short term solution and won't help with the underlying problems.   The shampoo you are using is likely good but it they also dry out the skin so another reason to try to get medications.  \n\nUltimately another option is for a dermatologist to do allerrgy testing (Blood, cheaper but less accurate or skin, more expensive/accurate) which can be used to develop allergy vaccines customized to your dog.  There are some medications that can be used long term to reduce allergies as well, such as Atopica, which can be prescribed by the dermatologist.",

I made sure to clean with accelerated hydrogen peroxide and isolated myself from my 5 cats until I was \"cleared\", while my mom mostly took care of them. My cats never had any signs until I noticed a spot of fur missing from one of my cat's right cheek as of two weeks ago. None of the other cats have signs. Mom doesn't have signs and sleeps with all the cats. The vet told us that it could be ringworm or it could be something else and gave us Douxo chlorhexidine climbazole wipes to use on the spot for 7-10 days. I will be meeting with the vet tomorrow to get a biopsy or culture, but I hear that this could take 3 weeks until I get results.\n\nClinical signs:  Thinly haired spot on right cheek right behind\rwhiskers present. Several blackheads are present as well. No abrasion is noted,\rno scabbing present. Other side is normal.\n\nI worry because Google says that spores can last at least 18 months in the environment. And hearing that you have to pretty much bleach bomb your whole house or throw everything away is frustrating. Ringworm ruined my life and I can't use my left index finger anymore because I have nerve damage on it because of the ringworm. I'm afraid that my cats will keep on reinfecting the environment or us, and then we will infect other people who infect their pets and what not. What scares me is that my vet was touching my cat's spot and not washing her hands and just letting my cat roam around the office. This makes it seem like it's not a big deal but I do worry that all the animals will get infected because of that. Am I overreacting?  \n\nDuration: 2 weeks.\n\nYour general location: TX\n\n**Edit**\n\nI just got back from the vet and they don't suspect ringworm because my cat's hair seems to be growing in that spot compared to two weeks ago. She said that the wipes that we've been using would have exacerbated or made the fungal infection spread if that were the case. But they did not do any culture or biopsy and did not think it is needed at this moment. I did voice my concern that I didn't want to catch it because of how it affected me, and I was prescribed topical ketoconazole to put on my cat 2 times a day for about a week to see if it heals or not. They said this wouldn't hurt and that I can do a recheck in 7 to 10 days if it doesn't look like it's improving. I just don't know if I should drop my guard and trust the vet, but they seem to be very lackadaisical even if it was ringworm, as evidenced by them cuddling my cat. \n\n",

If the skin is compromised by, for example, a cut, ringworm may be able to colonize the damaged skin, leading to infection.\n\nRingworm in cats can be a tricky diagnosis, because it doesn't always appear like it does in people (in dogs, it can look a lot like people ringworm). There are a couple of tests that can suggest ringworm, but the best (and really the only definitive) is fungal culture on special medium. \n\nRingworm in (healthy) cats tends to be pretty self-limiting. Often times, treating with anti-fungal shampoo or wipes is sufficient to clear infection. If your cats are immunocompromised, or have pre-existing skin conditions, your vet may discuss further treatment options with you.\n\nIf you are concerned that you are catching ringworm from your cats, I would encourage you to voice this concern to your vet, and also your primary care physician. There are systemic and topical anti-fungals that can be effective against ringworm. Your primary care physician will be able to help you with management of ringworm on your person, and your veterinarian will be able to help you form a game plan in order to manage the ringworm in your pets and decrease the risk of you getting ringworm from them.",

After it was banned in the EU, ciclopirox shampoo helped me for a long time, but over time it gradually began to lose its effectiveness. And now I am looking for a shampoo that can be rotated with my usual one.(with zinc pyrithione if it is somehow available or another substance).\nI should say that i already tried shampoo with ketokonazole, but it only made the situation worse, so i went back to my usual one. Shampoos with piroctone olamine (a replacement for ZPt) and climbazole also turned out to be ineffective.\nSo a question for you,my fellow sufferers, have you found an alternative to zinc pyrithione? If so,can you recommend any specific products? The question is mainly for residents of Europe, but I will be glad to any help.",

It’s a bit trickier to use, since I have thick hair… I use a needle-free syringe to apply it , then rub it in and let it sit for 10-15 minutes before showering and washing it out.\n\nThe trick is to rotate active ingredients, so you don’t become resistant.

    "body": "I've been struggling with itchy, dry, flaky and scaly patches of skin for over a decade.\n\nI have a history of acne medication, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, and tretinoin which left me prone to sun damage. Using of abrasive exfoliants didn't help, but I believe this all started after I got sunburned about 17 years ago. What was originally patches of skin on the forehead spread to the cheeks after using an oil based moisturiser to try to deal with what I thought was dry skin caused by the acne medications.\n\nIt's been about 8 years since I stopped using anything with oil or esters that could feed malassezia but the patches of my forehead haven't improved. They haven't got worse, the patches on my cheeks have gone for the most part, and things don't get really bad, but no matter what I've tried I haven't been able to heal these lesions on the forehead......\n\nWell, that's not true. I have used \"Charmpoo\" cream from amazon which claims to be 'natural'. It's a Chinese 'herbal' antifungal cream. It almost certainly contains powerful steroids and antifungals. It had an immediate impact and cleared the skin for about six months. Unfortunately, since I have no idea what is in this cream (the ingredients list provided is not complete), I can't keep using it. I did buy a second jar but it had no effect other than to sting my skin and make it turn bright red for a couple of hours......so aside from using this I have not had success clearing the skin. I have used ketocanazole shampoo, coal tar, zinc pyrithione, climbazole, miconazole, green tea and licorice extract. I've also used AHA, BHA, and Azelaic acids.\n\n.............\n\nAnd I have recently (just over one month ago) discovered Medicube products. Specifically, the glutathione glow serum. Glutathione and hyaluronic acid have some studies showing effective treatment of seb derm and eczema. I have also been using the Age R Booster Pro. The interesting thing about this is it uses technology to temporarily disrupt the skin barrier to deliver deeper penetration of active ingredients and this same technology is proven to be capable of disrupting the cell membrane of yeast cells. I don't know if this is partially responsible for the effects I've seen or not.\n\nAnyway, I'm in danger of babbling. I'm thinking what I need to do is focus on healing the skin barrier rather than try to avoid any and all oils and esters. The skin, after all, produces oil. It is kind of a losing battle to try to avoid oil. I don't think overgrowth of malassezia is a problem so much as it penetrating the skin barrier and causing an inflammatory immune response. Heal the skin barrier and minimize the inflammatory response and things should improve.\n\nGive the glutathione serum a try, it may work for you with or without the booster pro. The redness has reduced significantly as have the scale legions. There's no itching or flaking of the skin anymore. I can still see where these legions are/were as the skin appears damaged and there's still a bit of pigmentation, but it's so much better and still seems to be improving. I've also been using the collagen jelly cream and night wrapping mask. The mask in particular seems to prevent moisture loss at night and the skin looks incredible when the mask is removed the next day. The Jelly is really sticky and heavy but seems to be effective as a moisturising occlusive.",

I'm just wondering if you guys are allowed to answer if a biopsy or culture would be more reliable for ringworm diagnosis? I am afraid to touch my 5 cats because I had a bad ringworm infection 11 months ago that gave me nerve damage on my finger and developed health anxiety around that.\n\nSpecies: Cat\n\nAge: 5 years old\n\nSex/Neuter status: female, neutered\n\nBreed: domestic shorthair\n\nBody weight: 8.7 lbs\n\nHistory: Cat has to use a Flovent Inhaler (125 mcg/dose) every once in awhile when she has a coughing attack. She was initially seen 5/21/18 and the vet said \"it could be ringworm or it could be something else\" and gave Douxo chlorhexide and climbazole wipes to apply daily for 7-10 days. She said if it didn't look better by then, then we could do a biopsy.\n\n I did a recheck at the same clinic but with a different vet on 6/4/18 and was told that she didn't think it was ringworm because the hair appeared to be growing compared to the picture the previous vet took. After I voiced my concerns, she prescribed Ketoconazole and said to apply it twice per day until it heals, just in case. She said that at the moment, she didn't think that anything else was needed. \n\nClinical signs: as per first vet's notes \"Thinly haired spot on right [cheek](https://imgur.com/a/MtxWNu1) right behind whiskers present. Several blackheads are present as well. No abrasion is noted, no scabbing present. Other side is normal. Has had a change of bowl, but new\rbowl is metal and if this were the inciting cause I would expect the lesion to be\rbilateral.\" \n\nDuration: 3 weeks.\n\nYour general location: TX\n\nI am wondering if I should get a \"third\" opinion by someone out of that clinic, although I feel guilty since we've used their clinic for the past 6 years. The second vet was the one who fostered the cat in question back in 2012. But I feel that an actual diagnosis, whether it be a culture or biopsy, would give me peace of mind.",

        "body": "Fungal cultural is the diagnostic test of choice for ringworm, but if you have already been using Ketoconazole, then the culture may be negative even if there are dermatophytes present. Plus, it takes 2 weeks in the proper conditions for the culture to yield results (at least with dermatophyte test medium. And if you wait more than 14 days, you risk a false positive. Fungi can be really temperamental.)\n\nTheoretically, I guess biopsy could work, but to be definitive, the sample would have to have hyphae present. Did your vet mean a skin scraping, or an actual surgical biopsy? If a surgical biopsy, is it meant to include the hair bulb to examine the follicle integrity?  Skin scrapings are less invasive, but a skin scraping could compromise the integrity of the surrounding skin (especially if it's a deep skin scraping), which could allow for spread of ringworm (if it is ringworm), but could also irritate the spot further. \n\nBecause the spot is already being treated with topical anti-fungals, at this point, it may be worth it to observe the spot for a longer period of time. You don't want to put yourself (or your cat(s)) through unnecessary treatment/diagnostics. Even with proper treatment, ringworm can take a while to resolve since the dermatophytes disrupt the keratin in the hair, and subsequent hair growth can take time. If you really feel strongly that you need a further diagnostic opinion, you can ask for a \"third opinion\"/referral to a board certified veterinary dermatologist.",

    "body": "I have found a shampoo (UK) that is marketed as a \"scalp care\" balancing shampoo, with the following ingredients; \nAqua (Water), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Climbazole, Glycerin, Parfum (Fragrance), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Sodium Acetate, Limonene, Linalool\n\nJust wondered if anyone had any experience with  climbazole as an active? I had a bad reaction to keto shampoo and have been using ciclopirox and piroctone olamine, plus a \"sezia safe\" tea tree shampoo instead. Have had decent, but not perfect results (see previous post with photos), so am looking for something else that might be gentle-ish to add into rotation.",

In the past couple of weeks, I've been traveling with my dog and he has started to get more of these 'pimples' on his feet. I've talked to his vet before about them and they said it was mainly allergies and prescribed anti-bacterial/anti-fungal cleaning pads to clean his feet with (chlorhexidine gluconate 3%, climbazole 0.5%, phytosphingosine salicyloyl 0.05%).  In addition, my dog also got an allergy shot in May and that helped.\n\nAbout a week or two ago, he started limping/licking his paws and that's when I noticed his the pimples again. To combat this, I started deep cleaning his paws every couple of days with 70% IPA, then wiping it with the pads my vet prescribed, and applying neosporin to any open pimples. This seemed to help and some of those pimples went away/dried out, but today I went to clean his paws again and there were a few more. He hasn't been limping, just licking his paws when he's not occupied by toys or his chew bone and overall his usual self. What has me worried is that we did walk in a few areas were there's foxtails present and he's a bit overweight than he should be (hence the possible cysts??). I'm headed back home in a week and going to schedule a vet appointment tomorrow morning, but I just wanted to get some insight so I can communicate as much as I can to my vet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\npictures: [https://imgur.com/a/caMIrzM](https://imgur.com/a/caMIrzM)",

    "body": "Kepek, saç derisinin pul pul dökülmesiyle kendini gösteren yaygın bir sorundur. Kuruluk, aşırı yağlanma, yanlış ürün kullanımı veya mantar enfeksiyonları gibi pek çok sebebe bağlı olarak ortaya çıkabilir. Peki, [kepek nasıl önlenir?](https://reagain.com.tr/blog/sac-derisinde-kepek-nasil-onlenir) Doğru şampuan seçimi, saç bakım rutini ve doğal çözümlerle kepekle nasıl başa çıkabilirsiniz? İşte tüm detaylar!\n\n# Kepek Neden Oluşur?\n\nKepek oluşumunu tetikleyen birçok faktör bulunur. Bunlardan bazıları şunlardır:\n\n# 1. Saç Derisinin Kuruluğu veya Aşırı Yağlanması\n\n* **Kuru saç derisi**, nem eksikliğinden dolayı pul pul dökülmeye meyillidir.\n* **Yağlı saç derisi**, fazla sebum üretimi nedeniyle mantar oluşumunu hızlandırarak kepeğe yol açabilir.\n\n# 2. Yanlış Ürün Kullanımı ve Kimyasal İçerikler\n\n* Sülfat, paraben ve silikon içeren şampuanlar saç derisini tahriş ederek kepeğe sebep olabilir.\n* [Sülfatsız şampuanlar](https://reagain.com.tr/sac-bakimi-urunleri), saç derisini koruyarak kepek oluşumunu önlemeye yardımcı olur.\n\n# 3. Mantar ve Bakteriyel Enfeksiyonlar\n\n* Saç derisinde doğal olarak bulunan **Malassezia** mantarı, fazla sebum üretimi ile çoğalarak kepeğe sebep olabilir.\n* **Climbazole** ve **neem ekstraktı** gibi antifungal bileşenler, bu tür mantar oluşumunu engelleyerek saç derisini rahatlatabilir.\n\n# 4. Beslenme Eksiklikleri ve Yetersiz Su Tüketimi\n\n* **B vitamini, çinko ve omega-3 eksikliği**, saç derisini güçsüzleştirerek kepeklenmeye neden olabilir.\n* **Yetersiz su tüketimi**, saç derisinin kurumasına ve pul pul dökülmesine yol açabilir.\n\n# Kepek Sorunu İçin Etkili Çözümler\n\nKepeği önlemek ve saç derisini sağlıklı tutmak için bazı etkili yöntemler bulunmaktadır. İşte uygulanabilecek çözümler:\n\n# 1. Doğru Şampuan Seçimi\n\nKepekten kurtulmanın en önemli adımı, saç derisine uygun bir şampuan kullanmaktır. **Sülfatsız, antifungal ve bitkisel içerikli şampuanlar**, saç derisini tahriş etmeden temizler.\n\n|**Bileşen**|**Faydaları**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Climbazole**|Mantar oluşumunu önleyerek kepek sorununu azaltır.|\n|**Neem Ekstraktı**|Antifungal özellikleriyle saç derisini yatıştırır ve kepeği engeller.|\n|**Aloe Vera**|Saç derisini nemlendirerek kuruluğa bağlı kepeği önler.|\n|**Nane Ekstraktı**|Kaşıntıyı hafifletir, saç derisini ferahlatır ve yağ dengesini sağlar.|\n|**Hidrolize Keratin ve Kolajen**|Saç yapısını güçlendirerek kırılmaları ve kepeklenmeyi azaltır.|\n\nBu bileşenler, saç derisinin sağlıklı kalmasını destekleyerek kepeğin tekrar oluşmasını önleyebilir.\n\n# 2. Saç Serumları ile Destekleyici Bakım\n\nKepek sorununu azaltmanın bir diğer yolu, saç derisini besleyen ve yatıştıran **saç serumları** kullanmaktır. **Panthenol, jojoba yağı, biberiye ve ısırgan otu gibi içerikler**, saç derisinin doğal dengesini koruyarak kepeklenmeyi engelleyebilir.\n\n# 3. Haftalık Kepek Önleyici Saç Bakım Rutini\n\n* **Saç derisini doğal yağlarla beslemek:** Aloe vera, jojoba yağı ve argan yağı içeren bakım ürünleri kullanarak saç derisini güçlendirebilirsiniz.\n* **Saç peelingi uygulamak:** Ölü deri hücrelerini temizleyen peelingler, kepek oluşumunu azaltmada oldukça etkilidir.\n\n# Kepeğe Karşı Etkili Doğal Çözümler\n\nKimyasal içeriklerden uzak durmak isteyenler için bazı doğal çözümler de kepekle mücadelede yardımcı olabilir.\n\n# 1. Elma Sirkesi ile Saç Durulama\n\nElma sirkesi, saç derisinin pH dengesini düzenleyerek mantar oluşumunu engelleyebilir.  \n✅ 1 bardak suya **2 yemek kaşığı elma sirkesi** ekleyin.  \n✅ Saç derinize uygulayıp **10 dakika beklettikten sonra durulayın**.\n\n# 2. Aloe Vera ile Saç Derisini Nemlendirme\n\nAloe vera, cildi yatıştıran ve nem dengesini sağlayan doğal bir bileşendir.  \n✅ **Aloe vera jeli**ni saç derinize masaj yaparak uygulayın.  \n✅ **20 dakika beklettikten sonra durulayın**.\n\n# 3. Biberiye ve Isırgan Otu ile Saç Derisini Güçlendirme\n\nBiberiye ekstresi, saç derisinde kan dolaşımını artırarak kepek oluşumunu önleyebilir.  \nIsırgan otu ise saç derisini güçlendirerek kepeklenmeye karşı koruma sağlar.\n\n# Saç Derisinde Kepek İçin Günlük ve Haftalık Bakım Rutini\n\nSaç derisinin kepekten arınması ve sağlıklı kalması için düzenli bir bakım rutini oluşturulmalıdır.\n\n|**Ürün**|**Kullanım Şekli**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Sülfatsız Bitkisel Şampuan**|Saç derisine masaj yaparak uygulayın, 1-2 dakika bekletin ve durulayın.|\n|**Saç Serumu**|Günde 1-2 kez saç derisine birkaç damla uygulayın, masaj yaparak yedirin.|\n|**Aloe Vera veya Argan Yağı**|Haftada 1-2 kez saç derisine uygulayıp 20 dakika bekletin.|\n\n**Sülfatsız, doğal içerikli şampuanlar ve saç serumları kullanarak kepek oluşumunu en aza indirebilir, saç derinizin sağlığını koruyabilirsiniz.** Eğer kepek problemi uzun süre devam ediyorsa bir dermatoloğa danışmanız önerilir.\n\nKepekten kurtulmak için doğru ürünleri seçmek ve düzenli bakım yapmak en etkili çözümlerden biridir. **Siz de saç derinizi sağlıklı tutmak için** [doğal içerikli bakım ürünleri](https://reagain.com.tr/) **tercih edebilirsiniz!** 🌿",

I took my cat to the dermatologist to get a culture and PCR on 6/20/18 because I suspected ringworm.  Additionally, she did a Woods lamp test and found nothing.  She said that the culture could take up to 6 weeks, but the PCR would be ready within a week.  She also believed that IF my cat had ringworm, it could be due to my cat's inhaler being an immunosuppressant. On 6/28/18, I recieved a call saying that the PCR test came negative for all three strains of ringworm cats typically have and that she did not expect to learn anything more from the pending culture result since PCR is \"more sensitive than culture\". As of 7/9/18, she called and said that the culture showed a \"weak positive\" for *M. Canis*, which surprised her. \n\nIs there any reason to believe that this \"weak positive\" could mean that it is false? My cat's fur appears to have grown back in the 3 weeks since my appointment. None of my other 4 cats appear to be affected (she has one biological sister and 3 adopted sisters). Additionally, one of the adopted sisters also has asthma, but no symptoms. I understand they can still be asymptomatic though. My mom sleeps with all the cats and doesn't take precautions and hasn't had any signs (I know one commenter said that ringworm is opportunistic). \n\nI do apologize for obsessing over this. I had a traumatic experience with ringworm 7/5/17 that caused nerve damage to my left index finger, so I'm paranoid and worried that I have to do the INSANE environmental decontamination. I can't isolate my cats because we don't have room, and my cats would know how to open doors and drawers if they were in my bathroom. I just feel hopeless (will need to see a therapist soon).\n\n**Species:** Cat\n\n**Age:** 6 years old\n\n**Sex/Neuter status:** female, neutered\n\n**Breed:** domestic shorthair\n\n**Body weight:** 8.29 lbs\n\n**History:** Cat has to use a Flovent Inhaler (125 mcg/dose) every once in awhile when she has a coughing attack. She was initially seen 5/21/18 and the vet said \"it could be ringworm or it could be something else\" and gave Douxo chlorhexide and climbazole wipes to apply daily for 7-10 days. She said if it didn't look better by then, then we could do a biopsy.\n\nI did a recheck at the same clinic but with a different vet on 6/4/18 and was told that she didn't think it was ringworm because the hair appeared to be growing compared to the picture the previous vet took. After I voiced my concerns, she prescribed Ketoconazole and said to apply it twice per day until it heals, just in case. She said that at the moment, she didn't think that anything else was needed. I stopped using Ketoconazole and the wipes on 6/18/18. \n\nClinical signs: as per first vet's notes \"Thinly haired spot on right cheek right behind whiskers present. Several blackheads are present as well. No abrasion is noted, no scabbing present. Other side is normal. Has had a change of bowl, but new bowl is metal and if this were the inciting cause I would expect the lesion to be bilateral.\"\n\nAs per the dermatologist notes on 6/20/18 \"Dermatological abnormalities are limited to the patient's [head](https://imgur.com/a/kC0kVXi). A region of non-inflammatory alopecia is present on the dorsal aspect of the haired skin of the muzzle, adjacent to nasal planum. Immediately caudal to the whiskers on the right muzzle, a roughly 1-1.5cm diameter area of hair is discolored a light yellow; the hairs are dried in somewhat stiff 'clumps' (corresponds to area of topical product application). The hairs in this area are somewhat shorter than surrounding hair, but of appropriate density. Oral cavity, paw pads, claw folds, and remainder of dermatological examination are normal.\"\n\n**Duration:** 7 weeks.\n\n**Your general location:** TX\n\n",

    "body": "Species: Dog\nAge: 7 yrs\nSex/Neuter status: Female / Spayed\nBreed:  Terrier Mix\nBody weight: 75 lb \nHistory: Abnormal blood work, Seasonal Skin Allergies, Urinary incontinence while sleeping. Current medications: 1 Claritin daily, 1 fish oil daily, 1 Glycoflex 3 daily, 2 Bladder strength daily, Heartgard monthly, Bravecto every 3 months. \nClinical signs: Raw & Red paws, loss of fur\nDuration: beginning May 2016\nYour general location: USA / Midwest\n\n     I don't know if there is something legitimately wrong with my dog or not. I came to the vet with a concern and was told that my dog is considered a senior, and things happen when they get older. I express concerns about abnormal blood work and they say its no big deal but then 6 months later become concerned that the abnormal blood work might mean cancer. We've spent a bunch of money and time and stress and feel that we have no answers and even more questions now. I've lost faith in my vet and worry that we will keep suggesting new meds, and more blood work. Apologies for the lengthy post, I just want to give all the info that I can. \n\n    Starting around March of every year our dog Delilah starts to chew and scratch her paws, this lasts until we get a freeze here around November. Every year she ends up either getting a steroid shot or is put on oral steroids. We try to wipe her paws each time she comes in from being out in the yard. \n     In May we noticed that Delilah was peeing in her sleep. We put her in the crate when we leave for work and when we go to bed at night and each time we get her out of the crate, she has peed. We also have several dog beds around the house that she lays in while we are home. She will be laying in one right in front of me and then she gets up and the cushion is wet. We also noticed a change in her attitude and that she started to drink a lot more water. The vet did urinalysis and blood work that were all normal except for a slightly elevated calcium level. Vet said urinary incontinence probably bc of being an older spayed female and started her on Proin. I was not comfortable with all the possible side effects of this medicine so after a month I switched her to VetriScience Bladder Strength. Her paws were not terrible so no medicine was given at this time.\n     Fast forward to beginning of October. Delilah is still itchy and still peeing in her sleep. The vet finds yeast in her paws and she also has an ear infection. The vet gives Delilah Prednisone 20mg, Ketoconazole 200mg, and Douxo Chlorhex PS & Climbazole pads to wipe on her paws. \n      We follow all instructions and Delilah finishes all medications. We are now a few weeks off the new meds and we don't really see much of a change. We feel that she is drinking a lot more water and start to keep track, almost 4 liters of water in a day. We kept track for a few days and it was the same each day. She started to lose interest in her food and was not eating breakfast and had to be coaxed into eating dinner. She was finding and spitting out her daily meds no matter what we hid them in. \n     The vet is now concerned with a high calcium level from blood work performed back in May. The vet wants new blood work and is concerned that something is wrong, and says it could possibly be cancer even. We get new blood work and her calcium is still high, but it is now within range. The new blood work now shows her ALT as 441 IU/L and in May it was 34 IU/L. The vet said the jump could be bc of the steroids she was on or it could be cushings or cancer. The vet wants Delilah to take Denamarin to see if it will lower her liver enzymes and repeat the blood work in a month. \n     In the last week Delilah has gotten back her appetite and is almost pushy about wanting to eat at her scheduled times. Her paws are finally starting to clear up. She is still peeing in her sleep and drinking a lot more water compared to our other dog who is the same size. \n1. If the elevated liver enzymes are due to the prednisone, will they return to normal on their own or does she need to take the Denamarin?\n2. If the elevated liver enzymes are due to something else, will taking the Denamarin make the numbers come down, and mask that there is a real health issue?\n3. Is there something specific I need to look for to know if she does have something wrong with her? My concerns were downplayed but then all of a sudden months later they mention cancer twice and want repeat blood work. What f they new blood work has something different elevated? I feel like I am paying for all kinds of unnecessary test and meds and don't know what is going on. \n\nThank you in advance for any help you may be able to provide. I just don't know what to do next. I've attached the most recent blood work. I have the previous blood work and UA if needed. ",

But here’s the catch — a closer look at the ingredients list shows ZPTO (Zinc Pyrithione) and Climbazole, both of which have questionable safety profiles.\n\nIn case you didn’t know:\n\nZPTO was banned in the EU for leave-on and rinse-off products due to potential long-term health risks (especially skin absorption issues).\n\nClimbazole is allowed in limited quantities in rinse-off products, but it’s heavily regulated.\n\nWhat’s shocking is that despite these bans internationally, this shampoo is still available and doing extremely well in India — even with “Amazon’s Choice” and glowing reviews.\n\nI’m not saying the product doesn’t work (many people report reduced dandruff), but I’m seriously concerned about lack of regulation and transparency. A product using potentially harmful ingredients shouldn't be marketed as “safe” or “herbal”.\n\nAnyone else noticed this?\nIs this just an example of “efficacy over safety” thinking in the Indian haircare market?\n\nLet’s discuss 👇\nWould love to hear thoughts from anyone with a dermatology background or regulatory insight too.",

Up to date on vaccines. \n\nA few days ago he developed a small black crusty to his frontal chin. It wiped away relatively easily with warm compress. The area has spread a bit but I'm very confident it is cat acne. No other skin conditions than occasional darkish crusty to just outside his nostrils which I think is due to food dust. Anyways, we already use glass / glazed ceramic bowls, but I think he developed this because he likes to smoosh his food to the opposite corner of his bowl and kinda lay his chin in his bowl while he eats.\n\nAnyways, I've already ordered cat pads douxo wipes (Chlorhexidine, 3% Climbazole, 0.5% Phytosphingosine Salicyloyl, 0.05%). I also ordered nizoral (ketoconazole) shampoo. If the nizoral is inappropriate to use for its ketoconazole content in cats that's fine and I'll simply use it myself. \n\nI occasionally bath him, maybe once every month and a half, mostly to help shedding and sometimes because he accidentally steps back into his stools in his large litter box. \n\nSo I have 2 treatment thoughts:\n1) simply do these sparing baths with nizoral. The first bath with a 10 minute leave in to treat his current chin condition. Then just the once every 2 months or so with no leave in time.\nOr 2) just use the nizoral once every 3 days or so for now as a spot cleanse, leave in, then rinse (not a full bath), until the condition has cleared, with daily chlorhexidine pad use. \n\nObviously if his condition worsened I would discontinue and simply go to the vet.\n\nBasically I didn't know if the nizoral was acceptable for cat use, and if so, acceptable for general use or instead only to consider it purely as a spot treatment. If it is unacceptable to discuss specific treatment regimen  then simply answering whether nizoral is safe would be fine enough. \n\nI figured in either case currently the condition is mild enough that attempting to treat / monitor at home is warranted over seeking a prompt formal diagnosis.",

    "body": "Aren't you tired of chemical & preservative loaded anti-dandruff products that promise you hair like Rapunzel but leave you looking like *ganji chudail?*! Today, The most common anti dandruff shampoos found in the market contain harsh & hidden actives which may help soothe scalp inflammation in the short run but might come with a truckload of uneasy side effects like Hair fall in the long run.\n\n \n\nLet’s get to them one at a time!  \n  \n\n\n# 1.  [**Ketoconazole**](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-11593/ketoconazole-oral/details): The half Information dilemma\n\nWhy, you ask? The new popular ingredient in the anti dandruff industry, is an antifungal medication that works by preventing the growth of fungus, helps control dandruff and relieve flaking, scaling, and itching.\n\n \n\nAlthough, what we don’t know about this buzz ingredient is that in the long run it can cause severe consequences for your scalp and hair.\n\n \n\n* It can strip off the natural oils present on your scalp and damage the cuticles of your strands\n* Excessive dryness on the roots and ends can ruin your natural curls and hair texture\n* inflammation can give rise to rashes, burning sensations causing hypersensitive scalp skin.\n\n \n\n# 2.  [**Pyrithione Zinc**](https://www.healthline.com/health/pyrithione-zinc) : A Vile Villain\n\nIt is an antifungal ingredient common in commercial anti- dandruff shampoos. Apart from dandruff, it is also used to treat other issues such as scalp psoriasis, acne and eczema.\n\n \n\nAlthough very popular ingredient for dandruff treatment, it comes with dangers like:\n\n* dryness\n* irritation\n* disrupt the scalp's natural oils\n* excessive dryness or flakiness of the skin\n\n \n\n# 3.  [**Selenium Sulfide**](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-8706/selenium-sulfide-topical/details): Uncovering the Carcinogen\n\nSelenium sulfide, is another ingredient used in treatment of yeast infection and prevention of fungal growth. While more potent,\n\n* It is highly carcinogenic and can irritate the scalp if left on for extended periods\n* It can result in dryness, redness, or even hair thinning\n* There is an increased chance of contracting life threatening diseases like cancer, respiratory issues, etc. due to hazardous ingredients entering the bloodstream\n\n \n\n# 4.  [**SULPHATES(SLS/SLES)**](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/sulfates): Detergent Danger\n\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES/SLS) are the popular culprits.\n\nYou must have seen these common surfactants written on mostly every ingredient list of popular commercial shampoos. They consist of cleansing properties but a lesser known fact about them is that they are the same chemical that create foam in harsh detergents and washing bars. Long term use of shampoos which contain it can kill your follicles and dry out your hair.\n\n \n\n# 5. Climbazole: The Antifungal Dilemma\n\nClimbazole is a common antifungal ingredient found in shampoos and skincare products used to combat dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and other scalp issues. While it's generally safe, there are a few things to watch out for if you're using it a lot or for a long time:\n\n* Scalp Irritation: Some folks might notice redness, itching, or irritation on their scalp, especially if their skin is on the sensitive side.\n* Dryness or Flakiness: Climbazole can sometimes make your scalp dry or flaky, which can be uncomfortable and make dandruff worse for some people.\n* Allergic Reactions: Allergic reactions are rare but possible. They could show up as swelling, a rash, or hives. In serious cases, you might have trouble breathing and need to see a doctor right away.\n* Hair Troubles: Using climbazole products for a long time might make your hair dry, brittle, or more likely to break, especially if your hair is already damaged or dry.\n* Scalp Sensitivity: After using climbazole, some folks might find that their scalp is more sensitive to other hair products, especially ones with harsh chemicals.\n\n \n\n# 6. [**Dimethicone**](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/dimethicone#what-is-dimethicone):  Silly-cones\n\nDimethicone, a type of silicone commonly found in hair care and skincare products, is known for its ability to smooth, condition, and fight frizz. While it's generally safe for most people, there are a few things to watch out for if you use it a lot:\n\n* First off, dimethicone can build up on your hair over time, creating a layer that weighs it down and makes it look greasy or dull. This buildup can also block your scalp from getting the moisture and nutrients it needs, leading to dryness and lackluster hair.\n* It clog your scalp pores, causing irritation, blocked hair follicles, and even dandruff or dermatitis in some cases.\n* Plus, all that dimethicone buildup can actually dry out your hair and make it brittle, especially Dandrilys:\n* Dandrilys is a natural anti-dandruff ingredient that comes from the bark of the Ziziphus joazeiro plant in Brazil. It's known for its ability to help with itching, soothe the scalp, and effectively fight dandruff. This gentle yet powerful ingredient is a great choice for dealing with scalp issues.\n* So, how does it work? Dandrilys works by adjusting the scalp's microbiota and biological pathways to reduce dandruff, irritation, redness, and sebum. It can also help restore the skin barrier, control sebum production, and normalize cell renewal.\n* The benefits of Dandrilys include eliminating dandruff in just 72 hours, reducing histamine release (which causes itching), and calming the scalp. It's a natural and safe alternative to zinc pyrithione (ZPTO). Give it a try and say goodbye to dandruff for good!f you have curly or dry hair to begin with.\n* While it's rare, some people might have an allergic reaction to dimethicone, resulting in itching, redness, or swelling on the scalp or skin.\n* The tricky part is that dimethicone isn't water-soluble, so you might need a clarifying shampoo to really get it out of your hair. If you don't cleanse it properly, it can stick around **.**\n\n \n\n**The Hidden Gems**\n\n \n\nOn the other end, we at Soulflower have formulated our anti dandruff shampoo with this groundbreaking US FDA approved ingredient\n\n \n\n# 1.  Piroctone Olamine : The Better Molecule\n\n* It works effectively from the 8th day of application, reducing dandruff by targeting the Malassezia yeast, restoring balance to the scalp microbiome.\n* One of the notable characteristics of piroctone olamine is its long lasting effects, which even after rinsing, persists in delivering antifungal and anti-inflammatory advantages, enduring protection and health benefits for your hair and scalp. \n* This efficacy is beneficial for individuals who do not wash their hair daily yet desire to maintain scalp health.\n\n \n\n#  2. [**Salicylic Acid**](https://www.soulflower.in/pages/search?q=Salicylic) : The Sebum Fighter\n\nIt helps clear out excess scalp build up and sebum while gently exfoliating dead skin cells preventing fungal growth and conditions like seborrheic dermatitis and scalp psoriasis. Whilst, Tea Tree Oil has a soothing effect on the scalp barrier with its natural moisturising properties, that allow for gentle cleansing and elimination of itchiness on the scalp.\n\n#  3. DANDRILYS: Fast Action Against Dandruff\n\nDandrilys  natural & powerful ingredient is a great choice for dealing with scalp issues from itching to redness.\n\nSo, how does it work?\n\n* Dandrilys works by adjusting the scalp's microbiota and biological pathways to reduce dandruff, irritation, redness, and sebum.

I needed to use a selenium disulphide schampoo(once) before to break the micro biome barrier but after that it has been great.\n\nMy scalp often felt dry after showering and because of that I felt itchiness, but the scalp tonic has helped a lot in that department. I suspect I also had folliculitis(sore bumps on the scalp similar to acne but not able to squeeze them) and that have stopped since started to use the scalp tonic. I still need to use the selenium disulphide schampoo but a lot less now than before and it is much easier to maintain. My scalp does produce less grease aswell. \n\nThe bottle is easy to use and to spread all around the scalp and the hair doesn’t get greasy from it.\n\nOverall positive experience, used it in my eyebrow and around my nose aswell with positive result. Can recommend to try out! \n\nAs my normal schampoo I use Neutral anti-dandruff, active ingredient is climbazole and the schampoo ampo have a ph of 4.8-4.9z",

Because of this I suspect I could have fungal acne.\n\nMy skincare routine right now is:\nRound lab mugwort calming cleanser\nSkin 1004 centella poremizing ampoule\nPurito oat-in calming gel cream\n(All of which are apparently fungal acne safe)\nI also use the boj red bean mask and aqua fresh sunscreen but haven't been using either until I figure this out\n\nI began trying to wash my face with anti dandruff shampoo to see if it would help. I don't have any that contain ketoconazole where I am so I'm using one that contains climbazole (umberto giannini scalp restore) I might get head and shoulders if I don't see a difference. I also found a tube of lamisil cream that's not really for your face but it has anti fungal properties (terbinafine Hydrochloride) so I'm trying that too! 😭\n\nI'm looking for any advice or product reccomendations for whatever it is wrong with my skin.\n\nI just want my skin to be smooth for the first time 🙏",

Estetik olarak rahatsız edici olduğu kadar, kaşıntı ve tahriş gibi etkilerle de yaşam kalitesini düşürebilir. Piyasadaki kozmetik çözümler çoğu zaman geçici etki sunarken, doğal yöntemler ve bilimsel içerikli ürünler uzun vadeli sonuçlar vaat eder.\n\nPeki kepek neden olur ve kalıcı olarak nasıl önlenebilir? Reagain rehberliğinde bu soruların cevabını birlikte keşfediyoruz. 👇\n\n# Kepek Neden Oluşur?\n\nKepeğin en sık görülen nedenleri:\n\n* **Yağlı ya da kuru saç derisi**\n* **Mantar kaynaklı enfeksiyonlar (Malassezia)**\n* **Sık şampuan değişimi ya da aşırı yıkama**\n* **Stres ve hormonal değişiklikler**\n* **Yanlış bakım ürünleri kullanımı**\n\nKepek; kuru, ince beyaz pullar hâlinde olabileceği gibi, sarımsı ve yapışkan yağlı kepek formunda da görülebilir. Her iki durumda da saç derisinin doğal dengesinin bozulduğu açıktır.\n\n# Doğal Yöntemlerle Kepekten Kurtulmak Mümkün mü?\n\nEvet!

Doc diagnosed TE and recommending PRP but reading mixed reviews.\n\nQuestions are at the bottom of this post.\n\n\nBackground:\n\nI broke my Fibula near my ankle. I got a surgery to have a (Titanium? Chromium?) Plate inserted at the spot in July (17th was my date of surgery). A needle was inserted in my vertebrae to numb my lower body and three screws were inserted in my bone to join the plate.\n\nI started loosing a shit tonne of hair, noticed on 28th October.\n\nSaw a derm today and he prescribed:\n\n1) Anatrix pro Hair Serum\n\n2) Finasteride 1 mg\n\n3) Some multivitamin (Trilaze)\n\n4) lotion containing Piroctone Olamine, Climbazole, Zinc Pyrithione\n\n5) Zinc Pyrithione based shampoo (which I have been using for 2+ years already)\n\nAnd PRP therapy.\n\nHe also told me to not supplement B12 in any form.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1) Can a surgery of this scale cause TE?\n\n2) Is PRP effective? (It's not very expensive here so if it doesn't work, it doesn't work but I don't want side effects)\n\n3) Are the rest of medications sensible?\n\n4) Is intervention even needed for TE?\n\n5) The docs assistant told me might have to start on Minoxidil in a few months, once the shedding subsides. Is this accurate?\n\nThe derma/doc I went to is a very well regarded one, in my area.",

    "body": "Kepek, çoğu zaman sadece estetik bir sorun gibi görünse de aslında saç derisinin sağlığıyla yakından ilişkilidir. Başarılı bir kepek bakım süreci, yalnızca doğru ürünü bulmakla değil; o ürünü nasıl kullandığını bilmekle başlar.\n\nBu rehberde, “kepek şampuanı nasıl kullanılır?” sorusunun yanıtını ararken, saç derini yatıştıracak ve saç sağlığını yeniden yapılandıracak etkili rutinleri adım adım ele alıyoruz.\n\n# Kepek Neden Olur?\n\nKepek, saç derisinin dökülen ölü hücrelerle kaplanması sonucu oluşur. Ancak bu süreç şu faktörlerle ciddi boyutlara ulaşabilir:\n\n* **Kuru cilt** (özellikle soğuk hava ve sık yıkama nedeniyle)\n* **Seboreik dermatit** (yağlı ve iltihaplı deri tabakası)\n* **Mantar kaynaklı dengesizlik** (Malassezia türü)\n* **Yanlış ürün kullanımı** (sülfat, paraben içeren şampuanlar)\n* **Stres ve hormonal değişiklikler**\n\n# Kepek Şampuanı Nasıl Uygulanmalı?\n\nŞampuanı sadece sürmek yeterli değildir. En iyi sonuç için aşağıdaki uygulama adımlarını izleyebilirsin:\n\n1. **Ilık suyla saçını ıslat** – gözenekleri açar, şampuanın nüfuzunu artırır.\n2. **Avucuna uygun miktarda al** – fazla ürün, daha fazla etki anlamına gelmez.\n3. **Parmak uçlarınla masaj yap** – kan dolaşımını artırır, tırnak kullanma.\n4. **1-2 dakika beklet** – aktif içeriklerin etkisini göstermesi için gereklidir.\n5. **İyice durula** – ürün kalıntısı kepeği tetikleyebilir.\n6. **Düzenli kullan** – haftada 2-3 kez idealdir (ürün talimatına göre).\n\n# Dikkat Edilmesi Gerekenler\n\nKepek şampuanı seçerken ve kullanırken şu kriterlere mutlaka göz at:\n\n* **Sülfatsız ve hafif formüllü olmalı**\n* **Antifungal içerikler barındırmalı** (örneğin: Climbazole)\n* **Nemlendirici takviyeli** (argan yağı, aloe vera vb.)\n* **Saç tipine özel formüle edilmiş olmalı**\n* **pH dengesi \\~5.5 olmalı**\n* **Paraben, ağır parfüm ve renklendirici içermemeli**\n\n# Etkili İçerikler Neler Sunar?\n\nİyi bir kepek şampuanı sadece temizlemez, aynı zamanda bakım da sunar. İşte bazı örnek bileşenler:\n\n* **Climbazole** → Mantar oluşumunu baskılar\n* **Aloe Vera** → Deriyi yatıştırır, tahrişi önler\n* **Neem Ekstraktı** → Enfeksiyon riskini azaltır\n* **Argan Yağı & Keratin** → Saç telini korur ve yapılandırır\n* **Allantoin** → Kaşıntı ve kızarıklığı yatıştırır\n\n# Yaygın Kullanım Hataları\n\n🚫 Şampuanı sadece saç uçlarına sürmek  \n🚫 Bekletmeden durulamak  \n🚫 Sürekli ürün değiştirmek  \n🚫 Saç tipine uygun olmayan şampuan seçmek  \n🚫 Aynı anda birden fazla kepek ürününü karıştırmak\n\n# Bilim Destekli Ek İçerikler\n\nBazı vitamin ve besin takviyeleri, şampuanın etkisini artırabilir:\n\n|**İçerik**|**Faydası**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Saçın kalınlaşmasını ve uzamasını destekler|\n|**Kolajen**|Saç elastikiyetini artırır|\n|**Çinko & Demir**|Saç dökülmesini azaltır|\n|**Saw Palmetto**|Hormonal saç dökülmesini dengeler|\n\n# Doğru Ürün Arayanlara Öneri:\n\nSülfatsız, bitkisel, etkili ve dermatolojik olarak test edilmiş bir kepek şampuanı arıyorsan, tüm bu özellikleri tek formülde birleştiren ürünü senin için bulduk:\n\n👉 [**Reagain Kepek Karşıtı Şampuan**](https://reagain.com.tr/kepege-karsi-bitkisel-sampuan) – Climbazole, Argan Yağı, Aloe Vera, Nane Ekstraktı ve daha fazlasıyla kepeğe karşı bilimsel destekli çözüm sunar.

I've tried every routine, brand and ingredients, but only ever see minimal results.\n\nI used to have typical spots like whiteheads, but now I stuggle with small bumps all over my skin. They are usually the colour of my skin but get very red when I wash my face. My cheeks also tend to be itchy. Because of this I suspect I could have fungal acne.\n\nMy skincare routine right now is:\nRound lab mugwort calming cleanser\nSkin 1004 centella poremizing ampoule\nPurito oat-in calming gel cream\n(All of which are apparently fungal acne safe)\nI also use the boj red bean mask and aqua fresh sunscreen but haven't been using either until I figure this out\n\nI began trying to wash my face with anti dandruff shampoo to see if it would help. I don't have any that contain ketoconazole where I am so I'm using one that contains climbazole (umberto giannini scalp restore) I might get head and shoulders if I don't see a difference. I also found a tube of lamisil cream that's not really for your face but it has anti fungal properties so I'm trying that too! 😭\n\nI'm looking for any advice or product reccomendations for whatever it is wrong with my skin.\n\nI just want my skin to be smooth for the first time 🙏",

Ancak düzenli bakım, doğru içerikler ve doğal yöntemlerle bu sorun kalıcı şekilde hafifletilebilir.\n\nPeki kepek neden oluşur ve hangi doğal içerikler gerçekten işe yarar?\n\n# Kepeğin Temel Nedenleri\n\n* **Dengesiz saç derisi (çok yağlı ya da çok kuru)**\n* **Mantar oluşumu (Malassezia gibi)**\n* **Stres, hormonal değişimler**\n* **Yanlış ürün seçimi veya sık ürün değişimi**\n\n# Doğal Olarak Kepekle Savaşmanın Yolları\n\n**1. Elma Sirkesi:** Antifungal ve pH dengeleyici etkisiyle saç derisini yatıştırır. 1:1 oranında suyla seyrelterek duş öncesi saç diplerine uygulayın.\n\n**2. Aloe Vera:** Saç derisini nemlendirir, kaşıntıyı azaltır. Haftada birkaç kez saf jel olarak uygulayabilirsiniz.\n\n**3. Çay Ağacı Yağı:** En etkili doğal antifungallerden biri. Şampuana birkaç damla ekleyerek kullanılabilir.\n\n**4. Karbonat:** Fazla sebumu emer ve ölü derileri arındırır. Haftada bir kez kullanılması önerilir.\n\n**5. Hindistan Cevizi Yağı:** Saç derisini besler, bakterilere karşı koruyucudur. Maske gibi 20 dakika bekletmek etkili olabilir.\n\n# Güçlü İçeriklerle Desteklenen Bakım\n\nAşağıdaki içerikler hem kepeğe hem de saç dökülmesine karşı destekleyici özellik taşır:\n\n|**İçerik**|**Faydası**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Biotin|Saçı kalınlaştırır, dökülmeyi azaltır|\n|Kolajen|Saçın elastikiyetini artırır|\n|Aloe Vera|Deriyi yatıştırır, kepeği azaltır|\n|Argan Yağı|Saçı nemlendirir, kırıkları önler|\n|Isırgan Ekstresi|Kepek oluşumunu engeller|\n|Climbazole|Mantar kaynaklı kepekleri kontrol altına alır|\n\n# Ürün Desteğiyle Kepekten Kalıcı Kurtuluş Mümkün mü?\n\nEvet. Sülfatsız, nazik ve kepeği hedef alan içeriklere sahip ürünler bu konuda oldukça etkili. Örneğin:\n\n* [Reagain Sülfatsız Kepek Şampuanı](https://reagain.com.tr/kepek-sampuanlari)**:** Climbazole, argan yağı ve aloe vera ile saç derisini yatıştırır.\n* [Reagain Saç Dökülmesine Karşı Şampuan](https://reagain.com.tr/dokulme-karsiti-sampuanlar)**:** Aloe vera, procapil, keratin ve amla ile dökülmeye karşı etki sunarken saç derisini dengeler.\n\n# Uzman İpuçlarıyla Kepeğe Veda Edin\n\n* Saçınızı haftada 2-3 kez yıkayın, aşırı yıkamaktan kaçının.\n* Sıcak su yerine ılık su kullanın.\n* Saç şekillendiricileri azaltın.\n* Beslenmenize çinko, B vitamini ve omega-3 ekleyin.\n* Taraklarınızı düzenli temizleyin.\n\n**Doğal içerikler ve bilinçli saç bakımıyla, kepek problemini uzun vadede kontrol altına alabilirsiniz.**\n\nSiz kepekle mücadelede en çok hangi yöntemi etkili buluyorsunuz?",

My cat developed a new [spot](http://imgur.com/a/kC0kVXi) on her head so I'm unfortunately almost certain it is ringworm. I had a phone consultation with an AAHA clinic to ask about false negatives and how they would with with suspected ringworm patients. They said that the symptoms sound like ringworm to them (after I told them I had the infection 11 months ago) and said I could probably bring my cat in 10 days after I take her off ketoconazole and they will do a culture and black light test (what my usual vet SHOULD have done). This means no appointment until at least June 28. I do have an option of going to the dermatologist though, but will have to schedule weeks in advance.

She was initially seen 5/21/18 and the vet said \"it could be ringworm or it could be something else\" and gave Douxo chlorhexide and climbazole wipes to apply daily for 7-10 days. She said if it didn't look better by then, then we could do a biopsy.\n\nI did a recheck at the same clinic but with a different vet on 6/4/18 and was told that she didn't think it was ringworm because the hair appeared to be growing compared to the picture the previous vet took. After I voiced my concerns, she prescribed Ketoconazole and said to apply it twice per day until it heals, just in case. She said that at the moment, she didn't think that anything else was needed. \n\n\nClinical signs: as per first vet's notes \"Thinly haired spot on right cheek right behind whiskers present. Several blackheads are present as well. No abrasion is noted, no scabbing present. Other side is normal. Has had a change of bowl, but new bowl is metal and if this were the inciting cause I would expect the lesion to be bilateral.\" \n\nAs of June 13, there is a missing patch of fur on the top of her head.\n\nDuration: 4 weeks.\n\nYour general location: TX",

I know it's fungal because anti bacterials like Benzoyl Peroxide does not work on it a 100% but they went away when I used an antifungal called Clotrimazole in January. I'm pretty sure it keeps switching between fungal and bacterial acne but however fungal is more dominant one. However, I think I got resistant to Clotrimazole after 8 months and I broke out for a month before switching to Nizoral in mid-September. That didn't work as good as Clotrimazole did, so I switched to an antifungal shampoo called E45 which has Climbazole as an active anti-fungal. I have been clear for two months now but I just saw 2 whiteheads pop up in the same region today and I'm getting really frustrated and sad now. There are 2 reasons I see\n\n1) It may be because I didn't use the the shampoo all week in an attempt to wean off it (don't want to be on antifungals all my life) but it started coming back today.\n\n2) I moved into a basement where I can smell mold and maybe that's what keeps reinfecting my skin somehow? Is that even possible? \n\n\nI have also changed up my routine to include only products that will not make my fungal acne worse. Here is my routine \n\nAM\n\n1) Apply E45 for 5-10minutes around my nose region twice a week.\n\n2) Get in shower and wash face with Dr. Eddie's Happy Cappy shampoo which contains zinc pyrithione and is another anti fungal.\n\n3) Apply Clean and Clear Benzoyl Peroxide 5% cleanser only on my chin because I get bacterial acne there which has been clear for 2 years now (used to be my biggest problem area but cleared up after BP).\n\n4) Apply Acne.org 2.5% benzoyl peroxide lotion on nose and chin after shower.\n\n5) Moisturize my skin with Bioderma Hydrabio Gel-Creme  (except my nose because I read fungi thrives in moist environment)\n\n6) Use Cotz SPF 40 Facial Primer Mineral sunscreen on my cheeks region as they're sensitive to sun. (Again avoid my nose region as this product is heavy and I feel like itll cause more problems around my nose.)\n\n\nMy nose area is totally dry. The only issue is that when I breakout on my nose area, I start substituting benzoyl peroxide on my nose with antifungal like clotrimazole. I use BP on my nose to keep it bacteria free but when that area starts to break out , I go like\" Alright looks like its fungal\" so I start using Clotrimazole cream there instead which I'm not sure how much it helps as it doesnt work like it used to. At night I also apply Povidone Iodine solution sometimes as spot treatment when my nose region is starting to break out.\n\nRest of my face is usually clear but it's my nose that is the problem area now. It used to be my chin and mouth area where I would get at least 20 whiteheads but using BP was a life saver and got rid of it.\n\n\nIf you guys have any advice for me , I would really appreciate it.",

Normally a fungal infection would go away after 2 to 4 weeks with daily use. \n\n> I moved into a basement where I can smell mold and maybe that's what keeps reinfecting my skin somehow? Is that even possible?  \n\nYes it's possible, though it would be more detrimental to health than just a fungal infection. You might want to check the whole basement for mold and also invest in a dehumidifer and hydrometer to check the humidity. It's best to move to a place though.",

I was recomended trying Bioderma Sensibio DS\\+ Cream by another user in this subreddit, and it looks very interesting. In addition to climbazole it also contains another anti\\-fungal,  Piroctone Olamine, and also Xylitol , which I've heard is benificial for seb derm. What worries me is the coconut oil in this cream, which is terrible for seb derm, and a report of it being very drying, which also makes the condition worse. Anyone have any thoughts or experiences with this cream?",

Brands like Free & Clear might have what you're looking for. For the specific concentration of these compounds, you'll likely need to read the labels or reach out to the customer service of the brands you're interested in. Online retailers like Amazon or Well .ca could also be a good bet.",
