Lots of leather has dyes added and cleaning chemicals can remove that dye with the oil and leave you with a dark oil spot with a lighter colored ring around it. \n\nThey make an oil remover for leather that is sprayed on and it foams. As it foams it pulls the oil out. It’s safest if you use it on the back side of the leather but that involves upholstery work.\n\nThis is all if it’s true suede…if it’s fake suede or ultra suede call a professional and they can most likely get it cleaned up. No guarantee though, ultra suede is basically microfiber which is a super absorbent material and strong oils can bond with it and become problematic.\n\nSource: I’ve been a fabric and floor cleaner for over 20 years",

Go ahead and skip to the end of the post if you just want the recipe.\n\nIt's very simple, very quick, and quite tasty. I'm also pretty surprised at how flexible the recipe is. I had to use half regular flour, half gluten-free pancake mix (yay scrounging at work), sunflower seed oil, and I mixed in some spices I had on hand on top of accidentally adding a bit too much water to the pan.\n\nI fully expected to get a dinosaur turd but I wanted to try it anyways, the flour I had wasn't enough to really do anything else with.\n\nIt came out great. The only thing I borked a bit was not letting the other side cook long enough so it was *very* soft and moist.\n\nPepin showed the recipe [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wiOtjrvXgk)\n\nThe actual write-up of the recipe is [here.](http://www.food.com/recipe/jacques-pepins-flatbread-416395#activity-feed)\n\nEDIT: The write up seems to have missed that the oil doesn't go into the dough mix.

I'd like to provide a PSA as to why you should include sunflowers in yours.\n\n\\-Both heads and seeds are edible.\n\n\\-Easy to grow.\n\n\\-Seeds are nutrient dense and contain fats, protein, carbs, and vitamins.\n\n\\-Seeds can be stored easily for year round ending.\n\n\\-Seeds are easy to save for the next year's crops.\n\n\\-Larger sunflowers can make shade walls for plants that need shade in the summer.\n\n\\-Large sunflowers can be used as a trellis for things like runner beans.\n\n\\-Sunflowers can improve, clean, and decompact  soil.\n\n\\-They attract pollinators.\n\n\\-If you have the know-how, you can make sunflower seed oil and have a perpetual way to make cooking oil.\n\n\\-Dwarf varieties can be planted for an earlier harvest and taller varieties for a later harvest.\n\n\\-If you like flowers, they can make you smile. :)",

I grow most of my own calories.\n\nNot trying to be a dick, but sunflowers are a pretty terrible choice in a SHTF scenario other than for moral boosting reasons.\n\nIf you have an excess of space and time, they could be useful as added diversity/resilience. However I'm assuming most people with an 'emergency garden kit' are probably not experienced growers and will need to focus all of their attention on more valuable crops.\n\nCorn can do almost all of the same things you listed, and yields an order of magnitude higher in terms of calories per unit of land and inputs (time, water, etc). It is also significantly more resilient to weather, disease, and pest problems.\n\nPotatoes would be my real choice for the average person on a small land base in an emergency situation. Almost foolproof to grow, extremely high calorie yield, and they store well. But you would have to restock your 'seed' (tubers) every year. The best way to do that would be to grow some, so you also have experience doing it.",

    "body": "Biggest contributor to my skin one year ago was the fact that I was addicted to heroin. I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet. If someone with similar skin problems has any advice l'd appreciate it!",

I would say if you're a fan of the Avene  brand I would try their facial suncreen in the small bottle or their face and body sunscreen in the bigger bottle. Both are SPF 50 I believe and are mineral so there's less of a risk of irritation. My skin is like yours, I know how hard it can be for us to find products that work and ease irritation and sensitivity.",

Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is sorted alphabetically. (The price-per-ounce column was falling out of date too quickly with rapid price fluctuations; please see the [outdated 2024 version of the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/) for the most recent version sorted by price.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome!

    "body": "# PREFACE\n\nMy old go-to western cleanser was reformulated a few years ago and I've embarked on a quest for the perfect cleanser. While I haven't found my ultimate HG, I've had some interesting experiences: some good, some not so good... These are all the cleansers I've used this year.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I try to be as honest as possible with my reviews. That said, my skin is *extremely* reactive and my ratings reflect that. YMMV! - I should also mention that although I'll be describing scents, all the products I've listed are fragrance free, with a maximum of one essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SKIN TYPE:** Combo leaning oily. \n\n* **Proclivities:** Sensitive with mild rosacea, often dehydrated, and breakout-prone.\n* **Sensitivities:** Shea Butter, Fragrance, Essential Oils, and often Niacinamide. \n* **Climate:** Southeastern Canada, “humid continental”. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT ROUTINE:**\n\n* DEAR, KLAIRS Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil (PM)\n* ISNTREE Green Tea Fresh Cleanser (AM/PM)\n* (non-AB) PAULA’S CHOICE 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (PM, twice weekly)\n* COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner (AM/PM)\n* COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence (AM/PM)\n* ETUDE HOUSE SoonJung 10-Free Moist Emulsion (AM/PM)\n* ILLIYOON Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream (PM, often)\n* (non-AB) EUCERIN Aquaphor Healing Ointment (PM, sometimes)\n* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Water Fit Sun Serum (AM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WATER-BASED CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - OG** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$8 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 😳\n* **Used For:** \\~10 years\n* **Scent:** Doctor’s Office\n* **Wash Sensation:** Uninspired\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The hideous bottle, clinical scent, and uh… boyish texture make this an utterly joyless cleansing experience. But it’s as cheap as I am. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Gentle, non-drying, and doesn’t do a great job of cleansing, but TBH that’s often what I *want*. The best western cleanser I’ve tried, and my \"HG\" for many years, because sometimes you just need something that doesn't ruin your skin. **4/5**\n* **RATING: 6/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CETAPHIL Gentle Skin Cleanser - Reformulation** (non-AB)\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 500ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Niacinamide 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hospital\n* **Wash Sensation:** Disappointed\n* **Finish:** Irritated & Itchy\n* **User Experience:** Same as above, but it smells much worse and stings on contact. **1/5**\n* **Effects:** With the added “benefit” of the niacinamide, this felt similar to the original, but more drying. It also provides a long lasting itch and a slight flush! **1/5**\n* **RATING: 1/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - Mugwort Calming Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$15 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Mugwort Extracts 🧐, Sage Oil 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Allantoin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Panthenol 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Irish-Spring-But-Herbal\n* **Wash Sensation:** Slightly Attacked\n* **Finish:** Very Dry\n* **User Experience:** I was curious to try for the mugwort scent, but found it bland and soapy. This does a great job of cleansing, and creates buckets of foam that get into every orifice on my face. Probably not the best choice for my first foaming cleanser after a decade+ of only using milky gels. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Holy drying, Batman! I tried to convince myself that I just needed to get used to foam, but no. Just no. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ROUND LAB - 1025 Dokdo Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Chamomile Oil 😒, Hyaluronic Acid 💦, Ceramide NP 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~1 month\n* **Scent:** Chamomile & Plastic\n* **Wash Sensation:** Fluffy\n* **Finish:** Slightly Dry / Slightly Filmy\n* **User Experience:** Smells neutral yet slightly plasticky with a hint of chamomile. I found this vastly more pleasant to use. Same as above: literal pea sized amount = foam for days, but it gets extra points for the less offensive scent. Also the little seal on the bottle fills me with joy and I'm simple that way. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** This is much gentler than and not as drying as the Mugwort, but it also leaves a moisturizing film that I don’t like. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$18 for 220ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Yam Root Extract 🧐,  Oat Meal Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~a few days\n* **Scent:** Unsweetened Taro Bubble Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Creamy & Surprised\n* **Finish:** Liberally Buttered\n* **User Experience:** This has such a beautiful creamy scent. It would have been a gentle, soothing experience if my face didn’t just EAT IT UP. I tried using this on both wet and dry skin, but no matter what, my skin was hungry for yam. This alarmed me... Not what I want from a cleanser. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** I often have good luck with products for dry skin because I’m sensitive, but this was a good reminder that *I do, in fact, have oily skin*. Despite this cleanser instantly absorbing into my skin, it also left a thick moisturizing film that broke me out nearly instantaneously. **1/5**\n* **RATING: 3/10 WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BEAUTY OF JOSEON - Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$11 for 100ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰, so many plant extracts 😒\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Heavenly Bittersweet Plum\n* **Wash Sensation:** Completely Delighted\n* **Finish:** Very Moisturized\n* **User Experience:** The best smelling cleanser I’ve ever used. This has a sweet and fruity scent with an intriguingly sour edge. It’s a fun, goopy gel that creates an extremely tight and luxurious foam. It feels so modern and innovative!. Plus the package is utterly beautiful. **5/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling extremely moisturized, while doing a better job of cleansing than a western milky gel. But in less than a week it gave me hella whiteheads. I continued to use it for a further week because I was in denial. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 7/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETUDE HOUSE - SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$13 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Madecassoside 🥰, Green Tea Extract 🥰\n* **Used For:** \\~2 weeks\n* **Scent:** Grassy Almond Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Soft & Velvety\n* **Finish:** Untouched\n* **User Experience:** The best foaming cleanser I’ve ever tried. This has the same soothing grassy almond milk scent as the rest of the SoonJung line with just a touch of plastic. One pump creates the perfect amount of silky foam. Small gripe: despite how gentle this is, it gives me a lil eye sting. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** Does an excellent job of cleansing without being stripping, breaking me out, or leaving a film, but I also don’t find it hydrating or moisturizing - it’s just neutral. If someone's looking for a replacement for their bland western cleanser, this would be my top recommendation. That said, it might be a touch too drying for a twice-daily cleanse.  **4/5**\n* **RATING: 8/10 - MRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISNTREE - Green Tea Fresh Cleanser**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$17 for 120ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Glycerin 🥰, Green Tea Leaf Powder 🥰, Green Tea Leaves 😒, Green Tea Extract 🥰, Hyaluronic Acid 💦\n* **Used For:** \\~2 months\n* **Scent:** Hot Green Tea\n* **Wash Sensation:** Refreshed\n* **Finish:** Untouched & Hydrated\n* **User Experience:** The packaging doesn’t thrill me, but this is a lovely gel that creates a loose, barely-there foam. It smells delightful, and even though I can't use anything with fragrance, I love a good scent. This cleanser smells like a freshly-brewed hot cup of over-steeped green tea. It also has tiny leaves in it that mostly evaporate on contact, but I’ll occasionally get a bigger chunk and have to fish it out because I can’t deal with any amount of physical exfoliation. **4/5**\n* **Effects:** This is so gentle without being overbearingly moisturizing. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated even if I don’t apply additional hydration immediately afterwards. - This would absolutely be HG if not for the leaves, and I would highly recommend it to all but the driest of the dry skinned people. **5/5**\n* **RATING: 9/10 - WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FIRST CLEANSERS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BIODERMA - Sensibio Micellar Cleansing Water** (non-AB)\n\n**Price:** \\~$15 for 250ml (IIRC)\n\n* **Notable Ingredients:** Cucumber Fruit Extract 🙃\n* **Used For:** \\~5 years\n* **Scent:** Clinical Water\n* **Wash Sensation:** Cautious & Afraid\n* **Finish:** Sad & Soapy\n* **User Experience:** Apparently, even the finest Shiseido cotton pads are too exfoliating for my skin. This does a fine job of removing makeup and sunscreen, but I really don’t find this that gentle (possibly because of the friction with the cotton pads). - I know I’m in the minority here, but rosacea-prone skin really do be like that. **2/5**\n* **Effects:** Okay as a first cleanse, but if I use this on its own it breaks me out like crazy, even if I rinse it off. This makes me nervous to use it in general, and I'd rather just use an oil cleanser so I'm not wasting cotton pads. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 4/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DEAR KLAIRS - Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil**\n\n* **Price:** \\~$22 for 150ml\n* **Notable Ingredients:**  Sunflower Seed Oil 😐, Grape Seed Oil 😐, Jojoba Seed Oil 😐, Black Currant Seed Oil 😐\n* **Used For:** \\~8 months\n* **Scent:** Absolutely Neutral\n* **Wash Sensation:** Dubious\n* **Finish:** Slightly Tight\n* **User Experience:** I’ve technically been oil cleansing for \\~20 years because my childhood friend’s dad was a clown and taught me the way. That said, this is my first *actual* oil cleanser, and it's obviously miles ahead of well... food. - This smells like nothing, glides smoothly over my skin, and emulsifies instantly, but it could be gentler. **3/5**\n* **Effects:** The longer I use this, the less I like it. At first it worked wonderfully, but after many months it feels more drying with every use. **2/5**\n* **RATING: 5/10 - WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ISO: a new oil cleanser!** Thinking of trying either the Muji Mild Cleansing Oil or Peach & Lily Ginger Melt, but LMK if you have any suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[MANY EDITS: Mostly formatting, extra details, etc.\\]",

I love the way you describe everything and now I really want to try grassy almond water 😂 Was also really proud to see the Isntree green tea cleanser ranked so highly, it's one of my favorites too! For cleansing oils, if you haven't tried it I'd tentatively recommend Purito's From Green Cleansing Oil - it's been a long time since I've used it (I get too excited and want to try every product out there), but when I used it my skin barrier was terribly damaged and it was still really gentle, never stung etc. If you want to try another foam cleanser, I'd recommend the Real Barrier cream cleansing foam - I got mine at a great discount (StyleKorean, $9.90 for 220ml) and it's a nice balance between cream and foam cleansers imo! We seem to have similar skin types so I think this would work well for you in the fall/winter, though it does contain some essential oils so I'd tread carefully!",

    "body": "So a little while back I made a post about a compounding pharmacy I used to work at and I got a lot of comments telling me to report the place. I ended up deleting the post because it had been investigated, it was being investigated, and I personally knew people who had reported the place and it seemed like all of it did nothing to help. \n\n  Well I found out that those investigations may have worked and it’s closing its doors December 6th. So… without giving the name of the place - because I don’t know if the mods will allow that - I’m just gonna vent about all the shit that went down at that place. This going to be long so I’m going to break it up into 3 posts: The Coworkers, The Owner, and The Pharmacy. It won’t be all horror stories since part of me does feel bad that this place went to shit. I made a lot of good friends there and a lot of memories I’ll keep for a long time. A lot of this all together may seem too crazy to be real, but it was. I lived it (I’m still living with the injuries) and if you don’t believe me, that’s fine, go ahead. I’m just venting here. \n\n  **The Pharmacy**\n\n  *And here lies, in Massachusetts, a rift in the fabric of space and time within which debauchery hides within the walls and any shred of sanity has shriveled up and died long ago.* This place should have been shut down decades ago. There have been lawsuits. This place has been in the news - both on television and in articles you can find online about the things that went on in this place. But I’m here as an ex employee - finally feeling free enough to vent about it, since it is about to have its doors closed soon. One former manger once described this place as a “snake pit” and boy, that doesn’t even describe the half of it. \n\n  If I could describe the products of this compounding pharmacy, well, most was good medicine, but quite a bit of it was plain old snake oil. \n\n  For starters, we sold these colloidal silver nasal sprays for nasal infections. We made a ton of them, sold dozens if not near a hundred every week, and people would be taking these for years. And they were ludicrously expensive! I’ve heard too many times, the owner explaining to patients on the phone that their nasal infection could take a very long time to heal because as he put it “we don’t know how long you’ve had it or how deep it’s gone” and various other ways of saying that whatever was wrong with them was too entrenched to be dealt with quickly, all to justify why some people were still on these colloidal silver nasal sprays for years and years with no end in sight. \n\n  We catered to a lot of the “alternative medicine” crowd - and some of this stuff does have some helpful effects, but I have to question it when people are taking these things for years with no signs of improvement. We also used to sell Cholestyramine by the bucket - 480 grams specifically for people to eat spoonfuls of each month. The stuff smelled awful, I can’t imagine eating it every day. But for many people they took it, many in order to “cleanse” their bodies. But to each their own. \n\n  We sold many things as “liposomal” capsules. Methylene Blue being the biggest one - you can research what it claims to do, but I know people were taking it for years and the biggest effect is that it turns all your bodily fluids blue: urine, tears, even your sweat *blue.* We made those down in the hazards lab because they were such a mess and stained everything they touched. We had capsule machines that were used only for the methylene blue. But what is a liposomal capsule, you ask, hypothetical reader? Well I don’t know! The actual process requires equipment we didn’t have in a more high tech and refined process than we ever did. We just mixed the ingredients in with sunflower seed oil, heated it up to about 70 degrees, and put it in capsules. \n\n  The most notorious was the Ivermectin. *Pause for all the groans from the pharmacists and techs that know what I’m talking about* \n\n  We started selling ivermectin capsules as soon as doctors started asking us if we sold them. Originally an anti parasitic mainly used to treat livestock, in 2021 many believed that it could cure or prevent COVID. A virus. There was a fair bit of research coming out for and against it and the owner did a lot of research - only on the things that said it worked. To his credit he did fully believe it worked and both he and his wife were taking it when they had COVID. When we were making it, the rules were still changing on it and the prescriptions that were coming in changed by the week at some points in that saga. Some doctors would say to take it once a day, then others were saying once every other day, then others were saying once a week. Some used a uniform and common range of strengths, others were basing the strength off the patient’s weight. At one point we had an entire shelf halfway top to bottom filled with only ivermectin capsules, ranging from 3mg to 32mg some with regular capsules, some veggie caps, enteric coated, some with white rice flour as the filler, some with avicel and methocel filler, most with acidophilus as the filler \n\n  As a side note, he had us filling most capsules with acidophilus as the filler powder. It’s a decent probiotic with its own uses, but it was put in almost all the capsules as if it was basic avicel, all because it was smoother and easier to work with, while avicel is very staticy and goes everywhere. He put it in everything to make the work more efficient and get scripts made faster. \n\n  Back to the ivermectin, he made a killing on it. I forget the minutia of his pricing structure, but I know 2 capsules could cost $52 and some change, while those that got 30 paid $140. But from the pharmacy perspective, what made this the most frustrating was these dosages. Generally, our pills are only good for 6 months before they expire. (Less of course for white rice flour) When people were told to take 1 a week, I would make a batch, fill for 23-24 caps, and the next day or next week have to remake it so patients could get capsules that would last (and the doctors were always ordering these size supplies because as you can see above, it saved the patient money to buy in bulk - and no one knew how long this would be legal before the government cracked down on it). And so, because we had so many different fillers, cap types, dosages, and things needed to be made “fresh” more often than not, yours truly became his little pill monkey churning out ivermectin day in and day out. At its height 70% of the prescriptions I filled were just ivermectin. We also made it as a cream and suspension if I recall correctly, but 99% of it was as a capsule. \n\n  Then the genius put up a billboard on the highway advertising that we had an “ample supply of Human Ivermectin”. Because of course he wasn’t making enough money. So the state board of pharmacy, in order to not look like idiots, went to every compounding pharmacy in the state, checked out how much ivermectin they were making and for what species, and told them all more or less to stop making it for people unless they had a parasite diagnosis. Also they were saying we were making capsules with the same dose as commercial products, so we couldn’t sell capsules with strengths in increments of 3 any more. \n\n  So he’d stick them in an enteric coated capsule and say it was different enough. Meanwhile he’d tell the doctors he was speaking to, to just “make up a parasite diagnosis” - in fact he even told us pharmacists and techs that, when we were basically on call center duty (more on that later), to call doctors that had sent us Ivermectin scripts and ask them for a parasite diagnosis. In one shift I had spoken to two doctors who - after I had only told them we couldn’t fill the ivermectin prescription for covid *literally said “ok how about you write down that they have scabies”*. I took those both to the pharmacists, who all refused to fill any of these ivermectin scripts because they didn’t want to lose their licenses. But the owner still tried to push them through and the pharmacists would catch them before they got in the lab and could clearly see, because of the “once a week” dosage for the full six months, compared to the usual schedule for a parasite infection, they were able to catch them, while he has still probably been pushing them through all these moths later. Sometimes the owner would also be compounding in the lab, so it was easy for him to answer the phone, print out the script, make the capsules, fill the order, verify the order, and yell at the shipping boys to send it out all by himself. However… he also always made script under the tech’s names and often verified scripts under the pharmacists names, because he couldn’t be bothered to log them out and log in with his own name on Compounder. And we never knew when or if he was using our stations when we weren’t there and we worked the same stations every day so we usually left it logged in as us. \n\n  Things also got left out of the fridge longer than they should. Of course things don’t need to go immediately back in the fridge, but sometimes things like the large bucket of acidophilus we used to fill most of our capsules was left on the shelf beside the fridge for sometimes half a day. Most capsules that were filled with acidophilus never went back in the fridge at all, despite acidophilus itself needing to be refrigerated, once it was in a capsule, it was fine to leave that at room temperature. This might not be a “pharmacy sin”, I’m not sure, but in other places I’ve worked they generally put things with acidophilus back in the fridge after. \n\n  Overworked and understaffed: the illness effecting almost every pharmacy. For us sometimes it would be two weeks between the time a prescription was called in and the patient received it. In general we told people they should expect to wait 7-10 business days to receive their prescription once we spoke to them to get it filled - and at least we always made sure to call patients and get their OK before filling for them. Problem is, sometimes the two old men doing the data entry for new scripts would put in the phone numbers incorrectly, so we *couldn’t* reach them. When I was in the call center I spent hours every week for a period of time in between answering the phone, going through a list of hundreds of names of people who hadn’t given us the OK to fill their meds and call them. I’d get usually a dozen or more with each list that and a bad number, not to mention bad data entry. \n\n  First let me preface this by saying that while I was hired to work only in the lab compounding, within a week of working there I was told I would 1. Only be doing capsules. 2. then later told I would be doing capsules, filling refrigerated prescriptions, and filling all the Cholestyramine orders too (both of which used to be a whole other person’s job until they quit). And 3. Then I was told I would be sharing my hood with another person and spend half my week in their “call center” answering the phone. Meanwhile I also helped another tech with her work when she was covering all the other techs when any of them was out sick, so I was effectively doing the work of 4 people. I wondered why the owner never liked me, it was only after I left that the lead tech told me that he thought I was too slow and lazy, but he also didn’t realize how much work I was trying to do each day. \n\n  So that’s why I’m a lab tech and answer phones and dealt with data entry. Anyways, boy was there a lot of mistakes! Some ranged from the simple and humorous - like when someone typed in “terracotta capsules” instead of “enteric coated capsules”, or when someone typed “message into the vagina” instead of “massage into the vagina”. Then came the more serious ones - wrong drugs linked to the wrong prescriptions was the most common - and what the pharmacists wasted most of their time fixing - especially when it had missed them the first time and a technician made and filled the med by accident. Usually we techs caught those before filling them. The worst was when the wrong prescription was linked to the wrong person. I once had a terrible phone call where a woman called us and asked why she had gotten an automated message saying “her prescription was ready to fill” when she hadn’t had anything sent to us in years. Well turns out she shared the same first and last name with someone in another state, and so the owner just linked a prescription for that person to this woman. I had to calm her down about “identity theft” after we figured out what happened and then make a new profile for the person in the other state and give them a call. This was not the first or last time it happened. Did I mention we filled prescriptions for people in 30 different states? Because we did. \n\n  The next thing I want to add isn’t gross or snake oil, it’s just pain. The owner was obsessed with getting as much product made and pumped out as fast as possible and he was always trying to do things for efficiency. That’s why each technician had a station for a few specific dosage forms they filled (capsules, creams, suspensions, troches, chews, nasal sprays, etc). And I don’t know how many of you have experience in the compounding side of pharmacy, but capsules truly are the worst. \n\n  There are two models of capsule machine generally used in the field: the Jaansun PCCA capsule machine and the Profiller Capsule Machine. They come in two sizes: 100 and 300. These denote how many capsules can be filled in a batch, and as you can imagine, the 300s are quite a bit heavier, since the machines are almost entirely made of metal - save for some plastic parts in the Jaansun (though it makes up for this by having a much thicker metal base). Either way, they are heavy and do a number on your hands. To load and use a capsule machine, you have to tighten as much as possible and loosen and retighten various knobs and screws with each batch and pry pieces off when separating the capsules and sometimes you have to use all your strength to clamp and press capsules back together. Then you have to lock each capsule. Not to mention, getting all the powder in the capsules can get tiring - besides using a flat plastic piece to move the powder across the tray, you have to press the powder down with a separate plastic piece to compress and compact the fluffy stuff repeatedly. (Progesterone is probably the worst drug in the world to put into capsules, it’s both super fluffy, staticy, and sticky. \n\n Anyways, on top of that, to be “efficient” the owner also instructed us to, when we first put the powder in the machine, physically pick it up and shake it violently because - according to him and him alone - it gets the powder in faster. Then before you try compacting the powder, you’re expected to pick up the machine again and repeatedly bang it against the countertop (inside the fume hood) repeatedly. The later banging step is done in most pharmacies but no where else have I seen the shaking step. \n\n  Generally in a pharmacy the capsule making process involves 1. Weighing out the powders. 2. Mixing them - many places have machines for this, at this pharmacy we always only used a glass mortar and pestle. 3. Set up the machine 4. Put everything together in the machine. 5. Quality Control, fill,label, hand it off to the pharmacist 6. Wash your machine before you start a new batch. At this particular pharmacy, we sold a metric ton of Low Dose Naltrexone. We did because we had the lowest prices: about $42 for 90 capsules. You couldn’t beat that price anywhere and he knew it. So, just as an example, his most popular dose was 4.5 in a veggie based size 3 capsule. So we went through about 40 batches of 300 capsules every 2 weeks - this went up to 50 every two weeks by the time I left. So how do you fill 40-50 batches of 300 capsules every 2 weeks? Efficiency! \n\n  Weigh out 10 batches in one large quantity. Put it in the only large scale mixer we had, put that in 10 little jars. Do this 4-5 more times for the whole strength and *then* you start putting them in the capsule machines. In this method you spend time weighing and separating each batch in one go, then you just set up the machine, dump a jar in, put everything together in the machine, Quality control, dump it in a bucket, set up the machine, repeat. My friend that used to do all the capsules before she went to work in the hazard lab could do a whole batch of 300 of these in 5 minutes (from set up to QC). My record was 8 minutes and the owner always thought I was too slow. My record for most batches in a day was 32 in a 10 hour Saturday shift (9 hours when you subtract a lunch break). \n\n  Because this process skips the step where you give your hands a little “rest” while weighing and putting the pills in a bottle, it’s a lot more taxing on your hands. After a year and a half of working there and doing that multiple times a week (we did 40 batches of 1.5s, 3s, and 4.5s, and did 20 batches of a few other strengths), she developed carpal tunnel in both wrists, tendinitis in her right elbow, and to this day has trouble handling heavy things. I have tendinitis in both wrists, unspecified pain in both elbows, and I also have trouble handling heavy things. I’ve broken more than my fair share of beakers because of the damage I did to my wrists trying to keep up with the owner’s work methods. No other pharmacy I’ve ever worked in did it like that. The closest I’ve ever seen was one place that would give the capsule guy 10 batches of LDN to fill *at most*. \n\n  Back to that point about the owner in the lab. Suffice it to say, that man was just plain gross. His green jacket that he wore to work every day stunk because it was never washed and it was so crusty, it could probably stand up all on its own. He also (allegedly according to the shipping guys, who’s room was next to the bathrooms) never washed his hands. (We never saw him wash his hands before he came into the lab either). He refused to wear any PPE - no gloves, hairnet, lab coat, shoe covers… and he always either went without a mask or had it dangling off one ear. He once stuck his bare hand in the Cholestyramine barrel and licked it. He was known to pick pills up off the floor and put them in with the rest. He always put the front hood of the fume hood all the way up so it offered 0 protection to him or anyone else. And the day I left, I walked out because his hairs were in a bucket of Low Dose Naltrexone and he was yelling at me to fill prescriptions with it, when I refused. \n\n  In addition to other hairs that were clearly his (he’s the only one with short and grey in the company), I literally saw two pills stuck together by one hair - meaning they were in between the capsule halves too. I told him and the compliance officer I wouldn’t fill with them. The pharmacists knew we shouldn’t fill with them. He made me pick out every hair in the entire bucket and told me to fill prescriptions with the capsules. I refused. He said “so go”. So I threw off my gloves, grabbed my coat, and I walked out. I haven’t been there since. \n\n  Granted I had given my 2 weeks notice the week before and had a job lined up, but I was ready to walk out two days earlier in that week with the other stunt he pulled. \n\n  By that point two techs and his best pharmacist had put in their two weeks. He was more agitated than ever, panicked, and did things I’d never seen him do before. Two days before I walked out, I was in the hazard lab to make a batch of progesterone capsules. I opened the capsule bucket and started pouring them into the capsule loader. Low and behold, dozens of these *closed empty capsules* had white powder in them. These capsules (with white powder *inside* them, not just outside either) were mixed in with the clean capsules in the entire Medisca bucket. I went to a pharmacist who went to the manager who went to the owner. Apparently the day before he had been working late making a batch of T3 capsules and failed the quality control check. Well, instead of following protocol and bagging and tagging the whole batch to be logged and properly discarded, **he emptied out each capsule in the trash, closed them back up, and put them in the bucket with the clean capsules to be reused.**\n\n  I have a whole separate post about just the Owner and his wife. But… I just need to pause for a moment. The last thing I have to say about that is that, after this all came to light, the manager emptied the entire bucket of capsules in the trash, and we never spoke of it again. At least the pharmacist I had talked to took pictures of the dirty capsules. \n\nAnd if you’re already typing up a long winded way of saying that the owner should be in jail, he should be reported for all of this, etc, well, I think he was being investigated and I think it should just be left at that. The most recent update I heard from a friend still working there was that after most of us quit (12/16 people in the span of a few months) he wasn’t able to hire any new techs or pharmacists (the red flags would have been pretty apparent at that point), so he lost a lot of those 30 states and couldn’t keep up with the work load with only 2 techs, his manager was only there 1 day a week because she was looking for work elsewhere so he was saying his lead tech was the manager, and he was definitely being investigated for something, but I don’t know what exactly. I think he decided to close and sell his stuff to another pharmacy for many reasons. Lack of business, lack of staff, investigations, and honestly, he’s 70 years old. If he wants to retire I don’t blame him. I don’t know what’ll happen in the future, but I don’t feel it’s my place to speculate and at this point I have enough going on in my life that I want to just leave it to the powers that be to deal with this.\n\n  Also if this does blow up into a big deal, please leave me out of it. Use what I’ve written sure, but don’t involve me, don’t try to interview me, don’t link this to any news thing, just leave me alone. I’m just here to vent and let it all out. I don’t want him to know I wrote this in case he sues me or something.",

Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

        "body": "I don't think you can calculate the retinol percentage from looking at the ingredients list and 0.5% is pretty strong. I think in western products, if it's less than 0.01% then they don't state how much retinol is in there so maybe it's the same in this case?  \n\nI'm surprised to see kbeauty brands jumping on the retinol bandwagon. Would be interesting to see how this works out!",

Please go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/?\n\n Do you need to replace your beloved CeraVe moisturizer to veganize your routine? Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is **sorted by price per ounce** so you can shop within your budget! (Price update in progress - April 2023.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome!

    "body": "Hi everyone.\n\nI've been through like 8 bottles of this cream now, and it's definitely not talked about enough in the community. It's a HG of mine, my first and actual HG in skincare. \n\nMy current skin type (using tretinoin for 9 months now)-  dryer on cheeks and chin, oily on nose and forehead, very clogging prone, irritation prone (due to tret). I live in the extremely humid UK on the coast. \n\nI'm not sure how many people can relate, but I swear *EVERY. SINGLE. MOISTURISER. USED TO CLOG MY PORES AT THE END OF THE DAY.* Like at the end of the day i would look in the mirror and see lots of new closed comedones. I have gone through an unbelievable amount of moisturisers to finally get to one, that didn't clog my pores and cause that. Looking for moisturisers is hell, because I've bought so many moisturisers in my life that I had to give away. So much money wasted.\n\nMy face skin hates niacinimiade, sunflower oil, shea butter, certain silicones. This cream has fantastic ingredients, and although it has sunflower seed oil, my skin doesn't seem to care in this formulation. \n\nI use it in both the day and night, except for my 5 tret nights. As a 0.05 tret user, my barrier sometimes gets a bit damaged and irritated. Honestly, 1 application of this cream and it goes away. It's incredible for use with tret. In comparison, the PURITO Dermide cream did nothing for my tret skin. Too oily for day use, but for nights it wasn't moisturising enough, I'd wake up with dry skin. If my barrier was compromised, it took PURITO days to fix it. \n\nThis cream looks AMAZING under makeup. It makes you look like you have a filter on. \n\nI am not sure if it would be heavy enough for night use for people on tret, who have a really dry skin type. I think it's perfect for day use, but you might need to use an additional occlusive layer with this cream. \n\nPros of this cream: \n\n-NON CLOGGING!!!!!!!!!!! \n-moisturising enough for tret use \n-good moisturisers for both day and night use\n-looks incredible under makeup\n-heals an irritated barrier in 1 night \n-creamy pudding consistency\n-no smell\n-CRUELTY FREE\n-great for acne prone skin\n\n\nCons: \n\n-can sometimes pill under BOJ sunscreen\n-might not be heavy enough for people with super dry, eczema prone skin \n-often out of stock\n\nAll in all, I love, love, love this cream. I ache that its only 80ml, because I go through it fairly quickly and it's not the cheapest here, so I have to order from Korea. \n\nI have just ordered the toner, hopefully it is just as amazing. \n  \n\n\n\n\n",

Very lightweight feel rin na parang walang mascara sa lashes. \n\nBet ko rin ang formula kasi sakto lang, hindi watery or clumpy, and will coat your lashes in one dip lang from the container. \n\nOne con lang from this mascara is ang hirap tanggalin if wala kayong cleansing oil. Di talaga to titibag sa normal miscellar water or makeup remover. I personally use sunflower seed oil pangtanggal kasi di pa ako nakakabili ng cleansing oil. Within 30 secs naman tanggal na agad. \n\nIf naghahanap kayo ng bagong mascara, this is your sign 😊\n\n\n",

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  “Many persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier. I think I finally found my protein balance!)*\n\n - **Sukin Organics Nourishing Conditioner** *(100% carbon neutral and cruelty free. Contains cetrimonium chloride, aloe, and hydrolyzed protein. Good slip.)*\n\n - **As I Am Coconut CoWash** *(Lightweight, leaves my hair very bouncy and shiny with LOTS of texture. Great slip, very moisturizing, rinses clean.)*\n\n - **Tresemme Naturals** *(haven't used it but often recommended, contains drying alcohols low on the list, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra Sleek Conditioner** *(haven't tried, recommended)*\n\n - **Suave Naturals** *(haven't used, often recommended, range of options, some have NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **As I Am Cleansing Pudding** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*   \n\n - **Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains yucca, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Darcy's Botanicals Daily Cleansing Conditioner Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains wax, label says NO SURFACTANTS but it has BTMS, a very mild cationic, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Curly Q's Curlie Cutie Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\nDeep Conditioning:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** *(contains shea butter, aloe, panthenol, and coconut oil, some of my favorite ingredients; NO SURFACTANTS, also contains emulsifying wax so should be used sparingly)*, **Cold pressed coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair, protects protein bonds, but a little bit goes a very long way! Also very comedogenic for most people, be careful of it near your face. Excellent as a pre-poo treatment. Not ideal for chemically colored hair, because of it's penetrative abilities it can remove the color molecules.)*  \n\nShampooing:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** *(uses the gentlest surfactant on the market, decyl glucoside, NO PENETRATING OILS, [break down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1l4sjc/product_recommendation_community_survey_shampoos/cc0o2kz))*  \n\nClarifying Shampoo:  \n**Malibu Swimmers Water Action Shampoo** *(no sulfates but still effective combo of surfactants and ingredients that remove mineral build up, panthenol, smells like orange push pops...)*\n\nDry Shampoo:  \nThe best one I ever tried from the store was **Dove.** I prefer to just make my own with arrowroot powder and cocoa powder. Corn starch is popularly recommended and the ingredient in most of these dry shampoos that soaks up the oil, but I find that the arrowroot is finer and disappears better.",

Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

I've had a pretty oily scalp my whole life, and I am used to waking up and starting my day with a shower/washing my hair. I have never been the type that could wash my hair at night and then just get up and go in the morning. But now, I see that as being one of the many perks/benefits of this COwashing method! But here is my question - how in the world do you sleep on your hair so that it is still wearable the next day?? Not referring to the oily hair, which would be diminished by this new hair-washing technique, but the crazy, tangly roughed-up looking hair that I wake up with? Any tips or advice on this? Like I said, I feel silly asking about this, but I cant remember a time where I didnt wake up and shower first thing in the morning before going to school/work, so I've never had to worry or think about \"bed head\". Thank you!! :)",

At what point should I use the clarifying shampoo again? \n\nAlso you mentioned the Trader Joe’s conditioner but they make several, which one do you recommend? Thanks! \n\nCurrently I only clean my hair every other day. Should I be I washing everyday or is every other day cowashing/shampooing ok? \n\nI excersize often and my hair gets very sweaty.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

It's a different quality, even compared to your local butcher (usually, I didn't try all the butchers, naturally). You can feel it on the joints and bones - bio ones are hard to separate or break, while non-bio is usually easy even to bite the end of the bone where the joints connect. It means the animal had some movement in his life. If you don't care for animal welfare, it's still a product of better quality.",

    "body": "This will be a long read. I am not expecting answers, but I feel like I just have to release this.\n\n\nOne day (6-7 months ago), after a visit to my barber to get a haircut ,the topic turned to shaving. One question was thrown at me: \"are you still shaving with those plastic multi blade razor and canned goo???\". And this actually sparked the discussion. I remember asking a question about the price of those DE razors. He said that it depends… Starting from 30€ and going up as much as 200-300€. \"What a moron would spend 300€ on a razor?\" - I asked.\n\nAnd here I am with a more than 500€ worth of DE shaving equipment in my den. I've even bought a high-end bluetooth speaker to the bathroom to enhance all the subtle details of all the ritual by enriching the bathroom with some great music created in the same times when everyone was shaving with a DE or straights . That's right. I call it a ritual. A \"me\" time. A something that wakes me up in the morning and changes a chore into something very enjoyable. I've even started to set my alarm 20 minutes earlier as this was the time that my morning bathroom's duration was prolonged. And to be fair I can not remember the times, when I was waiting for the alarm to go off as I was waiting now. Each and every evening I was looking forward to the next shave. Best mornings of my life. I am sure almost everyone of you can relate to this.\n\nAll my life I was shaving with a Mach 3, using that canned goo and never had a thought about it - I didn't have any problems. My face was looking great and felt great back then. Never had a problem. In terms of skincare routine I was basically under a \"caveman's regimen\". Clear BBS skin every time after Gillette's \"plastic blessing gliding through a goofy foam\". \n\nAfter starting the DE I am sure that I've spent far more time in forums, different wet shaving articles and this subreddit than actually shaving, even though I was doing this 6 days a week. And I liked it.\n\nSo, after switching to a DE I've noticed that I am having some irritation on some days. Some days it was better, and some days it was worse. To a feeling that I sometimes wanted to poor a bucket of ice cubes on my face by midday. But that's nothing compared to my new breakouts. During this DE journey I've noticed that my skin became very oily. It was so oily that it looked like I was using a cup of sunflower seed oil instead of moisturiser. I was getting a new pimple every hour. And these were not just those close to surface ones that are easily popped and healed by the next morning. These were pimples so deep under the skin that they never came to a ahead. They were hurting and they were as red as baboon's butt. This didn't discourage me. I was doing more research. I was changing all the variables one by one, adjusting my techniques giving more time for the prep and so on. It was always the same. In this particular order tugging → irritation → itchy, burning, and oily skin → acne. I didn't stop. Tried almost everything.\n\nUntill DE I've never heard and felt such words as \"razor burn\", \"ingrown hair\", \"tight skin\", \"razor bump\", \"cut\", \"nick\", etc., because I've never had these with Mach3. And this is the second day already when my mornings became a routine again. I've decided to put every new thing I've implemented during this half year on a standby and get back to the same Mach3 and canned goo. It was the first morning after a while when Frank Sinatra didn't fit to the mood at all. On the second day I was shaving in silence… The skin? It looks way better already. The shave? It's sh!t. Results? Great! My mood? Sinking in tears...\n\nMy plan is to follow this \"new routine\" until new year. Then implement \"new\" variable. The first one of them will be ditching the foam can and replacing it with a brush and soap. Give it 2 weeks again. And so on…\n\nI really hope I can get back to the ritual I am missing so much already.\n\n\nThank you for reading this guys. Take care.\n\nEdit: grammar.",

        "body": "Um I’m not a boy so this may skew things, but I’m kinda curious how long your de shaving routine is compared to your cartridge shaving routine—specifically the shaving (passes/length of time) portion?  To me, as a girl, it sounds like you’re over-exfoliating your skin, but under-moisturizing it.  A de razor, I feel since it shaves me closer than a cartridge razor requires more not less moisturizing for me.  I’ve added in a pre-shave oil to my normal routine and a post-shave body oil.  From what I’ve read on the whole de razor process, maybe you should get a different shaving brush since I think some are scratchier than others?  Also, even with oily skin oils are really good for your skin and won’t break you out.  Maybe instead of an alcohol splash (this sounds so bad for your face), what about an aftershave balm with witch hazel or something to disinfect any cuts/nicks.  Also, maybe your skin is changing as you age—so your routine which always worked may need some tweaking.  For me, I’ve always been combination/normal, but now I’m closer to normal/dry and have to adjust accordingly; this is a natural process though and unrelated to shaving itself.  Also for some counter anecdotal evidence that it may be a lack of moisturizing, I’d always get razor burn after a cartridge shave when shaving my lady bits, but I don’t after switching to de razor and oils.",

My razor would tug on hair around my lip and chin area. Other spots and other times I would get my blade skipping around on my face as I dragged it over my face. \n\nWell, for me, I discovered that I was going too slow; I think it could be because I was trying to hear the blade cut and be gentle and all of those things boiled down to me being too careful. And being so careful, I was making my shaving strokes too slowly which was preventing my razor from fully acting as a blade. \n\nArmed with this thought and the most basic of tools (razor, lather, stiptic pencil, moisturizer/after shave) I shaved again and it cut through much more like a Mach 3. Some spots still had hair but that was no biggy; I'd either quickly go over it again right after the previous stroke or wait until I did a second pass with more lube. I'd also made it a rule to not ever go against the grain, but that was just an elimination of variables for me.  \n\nMy number one issue was never mentioned in guides and that is to treat the razor like a tool making fast strokes. Or rather, I needed to make deliberate strokes. Apparently there is a thing as being too careful. This is a realization in the last 6 months of an 8 year or so DE shaver. Apparently also my facial hair is more difficult than normal because Barber shop wet shaves are a unsatisfied miss with otherwise experienced Barbers.\n\nIf the Mach 3  with canned goop, use that as a base variable. If it works for you, don't listen to the forums where people post how crappy it is to use those. It's your face. Once things have stabilized for you, change only one thing: either the razor OR the shave soap. Get that new variable working right. When you introduce the shaving soap, I might suggest a shave cream instead of the million of soaps out there (a fairly recent aha moment). At least make sure rubbing the lather between your fingers it is slick. \n\nHopefully your face feels better on the end. Sorry for the unsolicited advice.

My issue turned out to be the DE razor I was using- I suspect I restored a lousy razor that never dialed in right and led to highly aggressive shaves. I get far less burn and ingrown after going back to basics, mapping my face, retrying a load of blades, finding better soaps. I had an appropriate set of razor use with all the wrong equipment to be blown away on first effort with the right equipment. \n\nIsolate variables. Is it the cart that works, or the goo that is working? Play some trial and error with brush and soap while using cart, then compare to DE with goo. I got better shaves with Gillette goo and the lousy slim than I ever did with good soap- and I have no idea why. And at the end of the day it is shaving and you do need to be comfortable; there may be better meditations for you.",

        "body": "I honestly wound up getting a lot less irritation when I went from DE to using a straight edge (Shavette.) It seems counter intuitive -- a DE razor is going to have that bar for protection. Shavette's are also very non-forgiving, but less maintenance.\n\nHowever, it was that same bar and bulk that didn't let me see what was going on underneath it easily with the DE razor. I have better control over the angle with the single edge, and the angle I'm using is more apparent. (All of this, at the cost of more time and the occasional lesson learned of getting a cut. Although, it's been a while since I've gotten anything more than what you'd get on a DE, and less frequent.)\n\nI will say, though, that it was learning good angles on the DE that really helped me know what I could and could not do with the straight edge angles wise. That, I think, was the more beneficial point of going with DE first.",

Obviously it would be more trial and error but it could help alleviate the oily skin for sure as it could just mean that your skin is too dry.

        "body": "I cannot comprehend how you could have so much difficulty.  I'm not trying to be rude, I simply don't understand.  I started out with a cartridge razor and canned foam.  Then I found the cheapest crappiest drugstore shaving soap and brush set in the late 80s.  I liked not trashing foam cans so I stuck with the soap and brush.  Around 2001 I tried my first DE razor and was shocked at how much better it shaved.  I used to have to \"rest my face\" every few months to get past the shaving irritation I had  cartridges.  That disappeared with DE razors that shaved with much less irritation.\n\nIn 2002 I decided to skip the 50 year old technology of DE razors and jump back to a hundred years to the straight razor.  Because I had access to a microscope I learned how to actually make a razor sharp as opposed to so many of the so call honemeisters who claimed to be able to hone, despite what my scope told me about their abilities.  \n\nSince that time, I'm perfectly happy with straights and soaps and brush.  \n\nDefinitely ditch the foam.  Get a brush and soap.  Find a decent DE razor and experiment a sample pack of blades to find what works best for you.  That is all that matters.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "After the Golden Rounds vanished for a week or two, I noticed they were back. Immediately, I noticed that the box was squat, rather than tall, and then the small circle burst with the words no one should want to see, \"New Recipe.\"\n\nAnytime I see that, I'm just reminded of all the bad changes that have happened over the years. Like when Breyer's Ice Cream, which was once \"all natural\" sold to Unilever, who remade the entire line with corn syrup and fillers while calling an \"improved recipe.\" They removed so much dairy that it could no longer be labeled as \"ice cream,\" instead becoming \"frozen dairy dessert.\" The flavor turned from natural ice cream to a nasty chemical one that left a bad aftertaste in your mouth.\n\nSo in regards to these crackers, what's changed?\n\nIt's still 12 oz, so not that. The Total Fat went up from 8% to 9%, nutrition label now hides where that comes from (polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats aren't listed anymore). Interestingly, the sodium was halved from 330mg to 160mg. The miniscule amount of iron dropped from 1.2mg to 0.9mg, while the potassium went from 0mg to 30mg.\n\nIn terms of ingredients, sunflower seed oil was replaced by \"vegetable oil (sunflower and/or canola oil). Cane sugar was replaced by \"sugar.\" The salt was changed to sea salt. Interestingly, two small adds, rosemary extract (accordingly to preserve) and a tiny smidge of sesame oil.\n\nThese now remind me of the oily cookies you find at Asian markets. They are somewhat more flaky, but it just tastes like oil to me. Even the color is unappetizing, looking like they were baked in half the time as the previous recipe.\n\nNot happy, won't be buying again.\n\nAt least the glorious Horseradish and Chive chips are back.",

We've seen it time and time again in the past couple of years. I have to believe that the result has been that they're saving a few cents to produce the item, but because the \"new recipe\" version is now \"meh\" (or worse), their sales of that product go way down. So in the long-run, they're losing money by trying save a few cents.\n\nGranted, not everyone will be able to afford the higher prices, but they're ruining their reputation for reliably great products.

But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

I may or may not have been keeping a weather eye on upcoming SPF releases ever since Director Ahn In-Sook mentioned in passing in a video that many cosmeceutical brands have either put a stopper on releasing new sunscreens or postponed the release of those awaiting completion to better the formula and ensure they're up to snuff, thus there will be a slew of SPF releases come March. ~~Heaven forfend we suffer the wrath of deadly solar lasers cuz finding The One is nothing short of a bluidy struggle.~~\n\nWhat I've noted in these new releases was a combination of robust formulas and new filters. *Exciting!* I've already translated the INCI lists and entered them into Incidecoder & Cosdna. Okay, enuff intro.

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

        "body": "Actually, most of the land we use for growing crops is used to feed the livestock people consume. We could feed the world's starving population several times over with the grains we give to livestock. Industrial agriculture as a whole is extremely damaging to many ecosystems, but it's actually factory farming that is consuming more land and crops than anything else right now. In many third world countries, meat is considered a luxury and grains/root vegetables/fruits are what people can readily produce and survive off of affordably. \n\nMost cows need to eat 24 pounds of grain a day, or 2% of their body weight. \n\nIf you're eating livestock, most people would need about an acre each for their cattle/pigs/chickens/etc., and enough land for their produce/grains. Someone who only consumes vegetables and fruits (grains included) needs about half an acre. There simply isn't enough land at least in the United States for 400 million people to each have their own acre to have grass-fed, personal farms for livestock. This is where we come to the issue of factory farming. \n\nIf you're worried about overuse of the land and wasting precious grains, the best thing you can do is start your own farm/garden and give up meat and dairy, as this is actually a luxury we're granted, at least in my country. But that's not something most people like to hear because it would mean giving up meat and dairy. We don't need meat or dairy to survive, but it's the taste, inconvenience, loss of tradition or customs, and necessity to learn a new way of supplementing things like zinc, iron, etc. from plant sources that intimidates people and allows them to give in to their own selfish ideologies about dominion over other animals. \n\nIf it were only humans consuming the grains we are producing worldwide, I could understand your sentiments. But in reality, we take grains from third world countries who are denied the right to consume those grains they produced in their own countries because they have to be shipped worldwide to feed the livestock in factory farms, so people in first world countries like America, can have access to meat and dairy products. If there weren't factory farms to feed, that grain would be used to feed human beings. I could go on and on, but I hope you see the point.",

What leads you to conclude that polyunsaturated fats are responsible for obesity? \n\nIt would make sense to me that you might be confusing polyunsaturated fats with trans-unsaturated fats (which I will now refer to as trans-fats).

This turns the once healthy polyunsaturated fat in to something far less healthy [link to source](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/trans-fat).

Thank you to the masses of people who gave info the help me expand this list, and hopefully this can help out some other folk too!\n\n*****\n\n**This is a guide to give personal input and experiences from valued members of the /r/skincareaddiction thread on reddit. This gives an insight into the different effects, usages and other desired info that might be desired from first hand users.**\n\n*****\n\nTo gain insight into the technical aspects of any oil please refer to [this](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html) guide. If you don’t want to scroll simply use ctrl+f to search the page for the desired oil to read up on the base information for it.\n\nAll oils have a limited shelf life. Please use the above guide to check the shelf life of most oils if you purchase any. Don’t use oil you think may be out of date on any part of you. You can extend the life of an oil by keeping it in the fridge, or if you have loads and won’t be using a chunk of it for a while it can be frozen. Please store your oils in the best way you have available to you.\n\n*****\n\n###If any information within this is incorrect, you have anything to add to it, or any other anecdotes then please do tell me. This was built from peoples comments and experiences so I'm happy to alter it to give a more well rounded view or accurate information where needed###\n\n*****\n\n\n**Apricot Kernel Oil**\n\n* One of the thinner oils\n* Doesn’t have a particular scent\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions but as always, this isn’t the case for everyone\n* Very nourishing for the skin\n* Easily absorbed\n* Though I don’t know why you would, DON’T CONSUME. Can be very dangerous\n* Has anti-ageing properties\n* Can be used to treat eczema, razor rash and sunburn\n\n**Argan Oil**\n\n* Golden brown in colour\n* Smells vaguely nutty – if it doesn’t smell very nutty it’ll be diluted cheap stuff and won’t help you\n* Very popular as a multi-use for skin and hair\n* One of the thinner oils but a little goes a long way\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be used effectively around the eyes\n* A favourite with respected skin care bloggers\n* Moisturising and can even out skin tone\n* Described as having a “silky” feel\n\n**Avocado Oil**\n\n* Spectacular for hair\n* Easily available at most supermarkets and shops for cheap\n* Not recommended for skin\n* Comedogenic – can cause blackheads by blocking pores\n* Goes off faster than most oils – will smell horrible and turn dark yellow when it’s off\n\n**Black Cumin Seed Oil**\n\n* Can be very quenching and result in smooth feeling skin\n* Due to its colour it can leave you a slight glow. This can be beneficial to some, but be careful in case it doesn’t work as desired for you\n* Doesn’t often break out people who are prone to acne\n* Smells like toasted nuts with a hint of caramel\n* Similar to Argan oil in consistency – quite thin, not sticky\n\n**Black Raspberry Seed Oil**\n\n* Smells fantastic according to most\n* Light green in colour\n* Full of antioxidants\n\n**Carrot Seed Oil**\n\n* Dark green in colour\n* Very powerful earthy scent – smell can linger so be wary that you may smell like it for a bit\n* If used in its pure form then be sure to dilute it. However, most types of it are macerated. (softened/diluted with liquid)\n* Very rich – not suitable for acne prone or easily irritated skin\n* Has an average absorption rate – will take a while to soak in\n\n**Castor Oil**\n\n* VERY thick and sticky/waxy\n* Is supposed to be great for improving hair growth – including eyelashes, eyebrows, scalp, etc. While this can be beneficial, some people report using it on their skin makes their peach hair darker and similar effects whereas others report no change, so be wary that this may affect you\n* Very drying so MUST be used with something else\n* Works fantastically in lip products to give your lips a glossy appearance\n* There’s so many different types of it that cause such varying effects depending on them that it’s pretty risky\n\n**Coconut Oil**\n\n* Raved about for hair because it’s one of the only two known oils that can penetrate deeply into it, allowing your hair to really be effected by it and not just coated.\n* When used on hair it’s very effective at controlling frizziness\n* Can’t just be rinsed out of hair, must be lathered and rinsed out so if you’re doing a no-shampoo regime or something then don’t use it\n* A riskier oil for skin as while some peoples skin loves it, it can cause horrific break outs in others – especially on the face\n* Refined coconut oil shouldn’t be used. It can be identified due to having barely any smell of coconut – You should only buy unrefined, extra virgin coconut oil for bodily use\n* Said that it can be used to reduce the appearance of skin marks such as Keratosis Pilaris\n* Can even be used on dogs to keep their coats healthy, if that’s a bonus to you\n\n**Emu Oil**\n\n* Mid-range thickness and milky in colour\n* A slightly unfavourable smell but not overpowering (such as Neem Oil)\n* Can be used for hair but isn’t very popular as many people don’t see desired results, so other oils are likely a better choice\n* If used correctly, it can be very hydrating\n* Not vegetarian or vegan at all – it’s emu fat\n* Is supposed to help products penetrate better, reduce inflammation, increase healing and plump your skin\n* Good for dry skin\n\n**Evening Primrose Oil**\n\n* Good for people who are acne prone, have dry skin or eczema\n* Needs diluted\n\n**Extra Virgin Olive Oil**\n\n* Rich\n* One of the thicker liquid oils\n* Effective make-up remover\n* Leaves a “plump and smooth” feeling to the skin\n* Can be very effective at reducing the appearance of SF’s\n\n**Hemp Seed Oil**\n\n* Very, very popular. Especially for use in OCM’s\n* Thin, hydrating and quick to dry down\n* Can be used on its own if it works with your skin – as a cleanser and hydrator/moisturiser\n* Ensure to wear with sunscreen\n* Strange smell - can be off putting for some\n* Green in colour\n\n**Jojoba Oil**\n\n* Dark golden yellow in colour\n* Has an earthy scent\n* Very thick. Feels almost slimy on the skin – described as “liquid wax”\n* Takes a long time to absorb so can feel almost like wearing a face mask\n* Can cause break outs – definitely patch test thoroughly\n* Is another one that can help hair growth, especially eyelashes, so can be added to mascara’s that are drying out to help\n\n**Macadamia Oil**\n\n* mildly comedogenic\n* light\n* fast absorbing\n* slight nutty smell that disappears after a bit\n\n**Mineral Oil**\n\n* Clear\n* Probably one of, if not the, thinnest oils – similar consistency to water\n* Can’t soak into the skin so can only be used as a cleanser/occlusive – better to use a moisturiser with it, but it isn’t drying\n* The least likely oil to break you out, yay! Just make sure to use un-fragranced as the fragrance can break people out. If the fragranced works for you then go for it though. (Fragranced mineral oil is just baby oil)\n* Great make-up remover\n* Probably the most popular for OCM’s\n* Leaves the face feeling very clean\n* Some people say it can make redness more apparent, but this is more specific to the user as others say it reduces redness significantly. As it’s the least likely to break you out, it’s one of the safest to try\n\n**Neem Oil**\n\n* A dark honey colour\n* Can be quite expensive\n* Extremely thick in consistency and solidifies when cold\n* Horrifically bad smelling so not for the light-hearted\n* Incredible for treating acne of all types. Will almost completely clear deep acne in a matter of days, and can do the same for surface acne in as little as 24 hours in some people\n* Despite its strength, it’s quite moisturising which is a benefit over other strong oils such as Tea Tree which can dry you out\n* Contains steroids - same steroids can also be found in many fruits and veg and can be quite beneficial, so don't fear, but just a heads up for anybody who didn't know\n\n**Sea Buckthorn Oil**\n\n* Can help even skin tone and lightening PIH\n* Bright orange in colour – can stain the skin if not careful\n* Can be used to make DIY products\n\n**Squalene Oil**\n\n* Comes in bottle and capsule version\n* Capsule version is thicker and milkier\n* Really good at helping other oils be absorbed\n\n**Sunflower Seed Oil**\n\n* Golden colour\n* Slight scent\n* An effective cleanser similar to extra virgin olive oil, but can be less clogging than it for some people\n\n**Sweet Almond Oil**\n\n* Pale yellow\n* No real smell\n* Softening\n* Doesn’t often cause bad reactions\n* Reasonably thick\n* Great carrier/dilution oil\n\n**Tamanu Oil**\n\n* Very dark green, almost black, in colour\n* Strong nutty scent but isn’t overpowering\n* Reasonably thick\n* Doesn’t absorb immediately, takes a little time but will absorb well if you leave it a little while\n* Analgesic (can relieve pain)\n* Anti-bacterial\n* Due to the above things, it can be very beneficial for acne prone or irritated skin\n\n**Tea Tree Oil**\n\n* Must be used minimally and diluted so as not to dry out or burn the skin – if used without diluting it can make your skin dry and scaly, or burn it badly\n* If used correctly it can make an effective spot treatment. One such method includes making a diluted tea tree and jojoba oil mix.\n* Can be very effective at preventing/clearing clogged pores, whiteheads and the likes\n* Anti-inflammatory properties\n* MUST use with a moisturiser\n* Has a “clean” smell\n\n**Watermelon Seed Oil**\n\n* Light yellow in colour\n* Only has a mild scent\n* Very light\n* Absorbs quickly\n* Can be quite drying so use with a moisturiser, but this makes it beneficial for oily skin\n* Good for irritated skin as it can be calming\n\n*****\n\n###If any lovely person can provide info on the following oils, I'd greatly appreciate it, and the people who requested it would too ;)###\n\n* Rosehip Seed Oil\n* Sesame Seed Oil\n* Vitamin E Oil\n* Vitamin K Oil",

Nothing too extreme, but enough to make my makeup sit differently than it used to. And milia (that I always had a little bit of) seemed to be getting worse. I turned to diet and hydration thinking it may have been related, but in the end it was my skincare routine that was lacking.\n\nAfter researching this sub (and omg, there is so much to read through) I finally think I have found my routine. It took awhile to introduce new products to make sure they react well with my skin, but it's solid.\n\n**AM:**\n* Wash face with water\n* Moisturise with Nivea Soft\n* Natural Instincts sunscreen\n* Makeup (usually napoleon perdis primer, NARS sheer glow OR Stila aqua glow, NARS rc concealer)\n\n**PM:**\n* Sunflower seed oil\n* Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\n* (bi-weekly; week 1) The Body Shop Drops of Youth peel\n* (bi-weekly; week 1) Moisturise with Nivea Soft + 1-2 drops Leonardi Hyaluronic Acid serum\n* (bi-weekly; week 2) Neutrogena Hydro Boost face mask\n* (bi-weekly; week 2) Moisturise with 1-2 drops The Ordinary Argan Oil\n\nMy skin feels hydrated always, my milia is disappearing, and I never get break outs (not that I did before, but even now if I get a pimple it's so tiny you can barely notice it!). Additionally I have less pigmentation and redness! (Bonus: my hands are softer as well!)\n\nSo anyway, thank you all for your hard work replying to comments or adding reviews or just sharing your experiences, because I would have never known where to go to find information for dry skin or recommendations on products that aren't motivated by endorsements or sales!

AMAZING!!! In 3 days, sores have fully or mostly healed, breakout are gone. Diaper rash cream is now a staple in my daily skincare routine.\n\nI'm sure my partner thinks I'm crazy but it's worth it.\n\nI use the sensitive Everyday Diaper Rash Cream from Honest, and it's also kind of moisturizing from sunflower seed oil.

    "body": "I more recently read how tretinoin is water-free and that water actually interferes with its effectiveness. \n\nAccording to the dermadoctor website: \" [...] water bonds with any retinoid and makes it more likely to cause irritation. What’s the #1 ingredient in any skincare product you could ever choose? That’s right, water. Retinoids are always a solo act. Never layer a moisturizer, night cream or anything else you can think of with it.\"\n\nI will moisturize, wait 30 minutes, then mix tretinoin with more moisturizer. I simply cannot apply it to a washed, but un-moisturized face (and need the additional moisturizer for spreadability). This method, however, has always resulted in flaky, irritated skin that takes several days (with use of a petroleum/paraffin product over dampened skin) to resolve. \n\nSo...I've been mixing tretinoin with sunflower seed oil, instead, before applying. What I'm finding is a HUGE reduction in both irritation and the dreaded \"flakies\". My skin is no longer dry and tight upon waking. \n\nThis seems to reflect the results of one study, in which sunflower seed oil was shown to exhibit \"significantly improved skin barrier function recovery, with an effect that was sustained 5 hours after application.\" http://dermatologytimes.modernmedicine.com/dermatology-times/news/skin-barrier-benefits-sunflower-seed-oil?page=0,1\n\nI thought I'd pass on my own little experimentation and perhaps help others who struggle with tretinoin irritation. I can't find much on mixing oils with retinoids (save for a few nays from docs on realself.com), but...\n\nIt's been working for me! \n\nUPDATE: **STILL** working for me! It's great to be able to use tretinoin without the flakies and being able to \"heal\" much quicker! \n\n\n\n ",

It made the formula too sticky and took too long to absorb, so I’m not sure exactly how they manage that. Maybe a higher quality oil? Increasing the MCT oil really helped to thin it out and increase absorption.\n\nThe fragranced oil I used was a dupe of baccarat rouge 540 that I like, but next batch I would like to find a more natural almond scent to use.

Luckily, I have found a couple great products this year including the Good Skin Days On The Bright Side Moisturizer and Pureforet Centella Multi Lotion.\n\nAnd, I’m happy to say I’ve found another awesome option with the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer.\n\nThis ingredient packed lotion features niacinamide, panthenol, allantoin, sunflower seed oil, chamomile, licorice root, madecassoside, ferment filtrate, and several forms of hyaluronic acid...essentially covering all of my bases.\n\nIn addition, the lightweight gel/cream contains knotweed, mushroom extracts, and soybean seed extract to add a boost of antioxidant and anti-irritation properties. Seriously, this is one of the most well-formulated and impressive ingredients lists I have seen in a single product.\n\nBringing things home...the Evenprime Daily Moisturizer absorbs incredibly quickly without leaving behind a film, residue, or heavy feeling making it perfect for my oily/combination/changes every day skin. \n\nOver time I have really appreciated how this moisturizer helps to calm my skin, provide a decent amount of hydration, and even enhanced the brightening effects of my exfoliation/essence steps. I honestly cannot get enough of this product!\n\nBut, now that the cooler weather is upon us alongside the dryness in the air (hello Colorado)...I’ve found myself looking for a bit more in the way of emollient “moisture locking” products. The Evenprime Daily Moisturizer hasn’t provided quite enough recently, especially for my pm routine.\n\nWhile I have been able to work around this by incorporating the Solved Skincare Jojoba Oil Serum into the mix (3 drops in the am and 6 in the pm), I could see those with particularly dry skin looking for more. \n\nThe Evenprime Daily Moisturizer is still an incredible product that I think just about anyone could see some benefit from...and rumor has it there might be a heavier version in the works! But for now, I’ll be continuing to add an extra boost and then reaching for something more rich in the coming months.\n\nFull Ingredients List: WATER (AQUA), GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, POLYGLYCERYL-3 METHYLGLUCOSE DISTEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SORBITAN STEARATE, ADENOSINE, ALLANTOIN, PANTHENOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SEA WATER (MARIS AQUA), CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA (MATRICARIA) FLOWER EXTRACT, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA (LICORICE) ROOT EXTRACT, GALACTOMYCES FERMENT FILTRATE , PENTYLENE GLYCOL, POLYGONUM MULTIFLORUM ROOT EXTRACT, PHELLINUS LINTEUS EXTRACT, ANGELICA GIGAS ROOT EXTRACT, PAEONIA LACTIFLORA ROOT EXTRACT, SESAMUM INDICUM (SESAME) SEED EXTRACT, SOPHORA FLAVESCENS ROOT EXTRACT, CIMICIFUGA RACEMOSA ROOT EXTRACT, MORUS ALBA BARK EXTRACT, SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS ROOT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA LEAF EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, HYALURONIC ACID, HYDROLYZED SODIUM HYALURONATE, MADECASSOSIDE, CARBOMER, TROMETHAMINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM PHYTATE, BETAINE\n\nWhere To Buy (Evenprime Site - $32.00 USD - 50ml): [https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer](https://evenprime.co/collections/all/products/evenprime-moisturizer) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fpmjp8sm3w51.jpg?width=4478&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed52b4aa2ef9dc48a80f5148feea62f55e8f8c83",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I’m related to the business for Besfren Beauty and Masksheets.com. But in the contents below, I didn’t put any products that are sold under the business or plan to be sold in the near future. The purpose of this writing is purely for information sharing and fun. If any of the contents below are problematic, please let me know. \n\nThere’s a sort of fixed trend for launching new cosmetics in Korean brands. From April to May, they bring sun-related products such as sunscreens, sun cushions or sun sticks. In summer, of course, light textured pore clearing products or brightening products are popular because of highly humid Korean summer. When the weather gets dry like now, deep hydration lines are on their best time. Korean winter is notoriously dry and many Koreans buy their F/W skincare routine around this time, so it is very important time for Korean brands as well. \n 3~4 years ago, oil based, fast absorbing, rich textured products were very popular, especially ceramide (Dr. Jart’s Ceramidine / Holika Holika’s Good Cera), omega-3 (IOPE’s Super Vita) and argan oil (many brands) contained products. Snail filtrate is all time favorite for all people so I won’t mention it much. Of course, facial oils are always “Must Launching” items.\nBut this year, the trend seems a little different from previous year. So I prepare some update for 2016 F/W Korean cosmetics, mostly from the road shop brands. \n\n\n1.Innisfree, the controversial Ture Care Cica Balm / New skincare line, The Black Green Tea \n\nSo, Innisfree also launched this year’s hot ingredient -Centella Asiatica-based balm in early September. They actually did very brilliant marketing this year. They give away 5 day trial sample of this balm, promising improvement on acne scars (at least in the promotion video, it seems like working and I was quite satisfied with the 5 days trial as well). The early batches were sold out fast but interestingly the reviews are quite polarized. While many reviews, people stated actual and visible improvement on acne scars, but at the same time some of the reviews were complaining about break-outs and redness. Seemingly, these break-out or sensitivity comes from added retinols or stearic acid. (They are commonly used ingredients but sometimes it may induce sensitive on skin)  So if you plan to buy this, please do the patch test before you use. Innisfree offers “Responsible Refund Policy (책임환불제),” so they give 7ml trial sample for free. It will be a little difficult for us to benefit from this policy though. Fermented Black Green Tea line is newly introduced as well. There are 3 types of products - serum, cream and wash off mask. In the website, it is stated that cream contains shea butter and serum contains platn squalene (From veggie oil) for oil so I think it will be a good hydration line for winter, if you like Innisfree. \n\n \n\n2. Etude House, Glow on Oil Volume Base\n\nSince Etude House is heavily makeup focused brand, they didn’t introduce any new skincare line this F/W. If they do, I will update you later. The Facial Blur was a quite a thing this year. This shimmering primer quickly became the queen of glowing primer along with VDL’s Lumilayer. Certainly, they are inspired by Mac’s long time steady seller, the Strobe Cream. The difference is, they give much more natural look on face since Strobe Cream. Anyway, Etude House introduced another glowing primer this winter. The texture is not very mineral/shimmering like Blur, rather it provides oil/watery glow on your face. Texture is in between watery serum and facial oil, and contains golden shimmering particles in them. It feels much lighter than Nymph Glow or Blur, so I think this will be quite popular soon. They introduced lighter version of this base (Glow on Hydra Volume Base) as well. \n\n\n3. The Face Shop – Korean Traditional Medicine Inspired\n\n예화담 채율 생기 순환 에센스 (CHAEYUL Revitalizing Essence) was introduced this F/W. This serum is made from LG’s high-end brand “The History of Whoo” and formulated with lactobacillus / bean fermentation filtrate, plant squalene, shea butter and many other herb extracts, along with conventional ingredients. Interestingly, titanium dioxide is added for unknown reason (seemingly for the instant brightening). Since it claims to be Hanbang (Korean Traditional Medicine) cosmetic, it contains many herb extracts but compared to other brands, this serum doesn’t seem new. So in my humble / personal opinion, The Face Shop’s F/W was quite disappointing. (I’m not saying this product is bad or something, but I’m just saying it seems quite conventional compared to other brands) \n\n\n\n4. Tonymoly – Black Tea London Classic Serum\n\nSo, probably, this F/W is a Tea Time. While Innisfree uses Green Tean, Tonlymoly brought Black Tea. They had collaboration with Taylors of Harrogate this year and they use black tea extract from England. They use black extract as a base, and added niacinamide as a brightening / anti-aging ingredient. They said Aureobasidium pullulans (black bacillus) filtrate was added but I couldn’t find them from their ingredient list, probably they are contained in their black tea extract base (56%). I think their composition approach is commendable since all of their ingredients are under EWG 2 level. It feels pretty nice and watery but sunflower seed oil and bergamot fruit oil nicely give hydration lock-up for skin. I was quite happy to see Tonymoly’s Black Tea London Classic Serum because I could see they tried really hard to make this serum with safer ingredients. Believe me, it is not easy to make a cosmetic without EWG 3,4,5 ingredients without compromising the texture. \n\n\n\n5. The Saem – Urban Eco Waratah Cream \n\nAlthough Waratah didn’t come out this F/W, it is rather under-appreciated and it is a deep hydration line, so I will talk about this cream here. Just like the Saem did with many other products, the Saem substitute water with Waratah extract (55%) and used it as its base. As they market this cream as “skin protection layer strengthening cream,” they added some skin identical, skin repairing molecules like ceramide NP and Phytosphingosine. I think one of the greatest strength in the products of the Seam is texture. This cream has fast-absorbing, silky, non-sticky texture. So if you are more like a texture person, this cream may be the one for this F/W. Ah, dimethicone is added for the texture, so be aware if it concerns you. But texture is just like heaven  \n\n6.\tIt’s Skin, Flower Cell Cream \n\nAfter their famous snail cream, it’s skin’s skincare line has not been very successful for past few years. This year, It’s Skin brought Firming cream with Edelweiss Callus cell culture extract. I know callus cell culture’s skin improving ability is controversial and not scientifically proven most of the time, it is just nice to see It’s Skin’s new product. Other than Edelweiss callus cell culture extract, the composition is pretty conventional but they added good moisturizing ingredients like squalene, sodium hyaluronate and betaine. Adenosine is added as firming / anti-aging ingredient. As I mentioned above, I am really glad to see new skincare line from It’s Skin, but it’s quite questionable that this product will do really well in this competitive market this F/W because of their passive marketing and no “Wow” or “New” factor in this product.  Package design is also somewhat old as well. \n",

    "body": "I’ve been using these toners for the past month or so. I’ve been looking for a milky toner that works for my skin for a while now and Purito’s one was immediately of interest to me, but given how much I enjoy Isntree’s Yam Root Vegan Milk Cleanser, I thought I should try the toner from the same line as well. Other than meadowfoam seed oil and glycerin, they don’t have any ingredients in common, but they’re both hybrid oil-water toners and they’re both aimed at dry and/or sensitive skin. So, I thought it would be worthwhile comparing the two.\n\nMy skin type: Combination, sensitive skin which leans oilier (esp t-zone) in summer and dryer (esp cheeks) in winter. I’m also in the 40+ age range, so I guess I have mature skin (or heading towards mature). It’s currently Autumn/Fall here and it’s usually this time of year that my skin becomes extra sensitive so it was the right time to introduce this type of product into my routine.\n\nInitially, I used both toners and put Purito on one side of my face and Isntree on the other. By doing this, I noticed that Isntree is slightly oilier than Purito and while my skin was like a sponge when it came to absorbing the Purito toner, it took longer for the Isntree one to be absorbed. The finish is also quite different. On the Purito side, it felt very silky (I guess it’s well-named) while the Isntree side remained a little oily. I also noticed the Isntree side developing a bit of congestion, but I wasn’t prepared to write it off for that because that’s the side that I usually sleep on.\n\nNext, I used Purito on its own for two weeks. Totally satisfying! It’s soothing, lightweight and overall enjoyable to use. It smells pretty much exactly like oats which I don’t hate. I can definitely see this becoming a regular part of my routine.\n\nFinally, I’ve just completed a week of using Isntree on its own and yep congestion increased on both sides of my face and I didn’t like the finish much. In terms of smell, I didn’t really notice one, so that might work quite well for some folks. This might still be worthwhile for me to try again in the winter, but it’s definitely not working for me now.\n\n**Isntree Yam Root Vegan Milk Toner Ingredients:**\n\nYam Root Extract (80%), Butylene Glycol 1,2-hexanediol, Purified Water, Trehalose, Panthenol, Sunflower Seed Oil, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Sodium Surfactin, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hibiscus Esculentus Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Root Extract, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Malt Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Disodium EDTA, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Sodium Polyacrylate, Citric Acid, Deoxyphytantriyl Palmitamide MEA, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract\n\n**Purito Oat-In Silky Toner Ingredients:**\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Water, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Beta-Glucan\n\nIf I left anything out, or you want anything more specific on either product, please let me know.",

I was searching the sub for the cream reviews for future winter purchase and happened to end up here.\n\nSad to hear the Isntree Yam toner was giving you some congestion.  There are so many kinds of oil in this product so I can see this being a problem for me. Hopefully I'll fare better with the cream in the winter months.\n\nThe Purito toner wasnt really on my radar cause the cream seemed to fare better at calming and hydrating over the toner, but it was TOO nourishing. Your review is swaying me to get the toner now for the summer :) the oat and beta-glucan is nice and simple, and seems like I can really layer it on.",

Till this point I am wondering if that post OP is conducting a social experiment.\n\nEg: OP posts mentioned cooking oil and table salt will have 5% sales tax (those items are under excluded sales tax).  Source : [https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/758677](https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/758677)   \nYou can also find them in the official source under \"15.17\" for cooking oil  (feel free to correct me on this) and  \"25.01\" for table salts\n\n>Essential imported food items, including rice, wheat, sugar, salt and meat, are exempted from SST. Palm oil-based cooking oil, Malaysia’s most commonly used vegetable oil, is also exempt, while sunflower seed oil will be subject to a 5% sales tax.\n\nThat's why I am of the opinion we unfortunately truly deserved the politician have right now, because we questioning everything for the sake of complaining, not for the sake of clarity.\n\nI hope we can see more \"Yea I can't find salmon in exempted sales tax list, I am going to complain government increasing price of my salmons\" instead of \"Yea Anchovies are going to have sales tax because some redditor posted its going to be taxed 5%, my nasi lemak is going to be more expensive, and I am too lazy to verify it \".",

    "body": "I was on Sephora.com last week about to order some Kat Von D makeup removing wipes (I was hoping to find something that would take off waterproof everything and I recall the sample of hers doing the trick, as in being ridiculously oily.) when I came across something brand new: [Urban Decay's Makeup Removing Wipes](http://www.sephora.com/meltdown-makeup-remover-wipes-P409954?skuId=1850403&icid2=D=c6:products%20grid:p409954). I can literally not find these anywhere else, not a review, nothing. Or at least I couldn't prior to Friday. I was trying to find an ingredient list before ordering, but it was as though they did not exist other than the listing on Sephora.com to buy.  Since they were really reasonably priced (ETA: reasonable by Sephora standards.) and you get 100 wipes in the pack, I figured what the hell. I seem to have no self control when it comes to anything makeup related and just buy it like it's nothin'. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2kCl2Z\n\nThey arrived today and even though it's only 530 pm, and I really don't normally take my makeup off this early so as not to scare small children or offend their sensibilities (my niece has some pretty strong opinions about me going out without makeup on: she \"doesn't prefer it.\") I could not wait to test them out and see if they worked better than the [Aveeno ones](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod5600049)  (shit, yo, Ulta charges way more, get em at Target or Drugstore.com or something!) I'd been using or if they burned any less. (FYI--they still burn but not as badly, but I have ridiculously sensitive skin, plus retinoids. So, everything burns.) \n\n\n\n*Sizing, and about the wipe:*\n\nThe sheets themselves are bit smaller (6.5\" x 4.5\") than the Aveeno ones (7.4\" x7.2\" per the package, so a little over 7\" square), but compared to the Aveeno ones were slightly damper--not as wet as I would like though and not as wet as I recall the Aveeno ones being in the past--and certainly not as damp as the Simple Micellar Wipes are.  I've had several packs of Aveeno ones that have been really dry lately from the start, and dried out before the pack was even half done. \n\nThe wipes themselves are texturally similar. The Aveeno ones are slightly thicker, and stronger than the UD ones, but the UD ones are labeled as biodegradable. \n\nA used UD wipe:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tcuMw6M\n\n\n\n*Efficacy/Usage:*\n\nI usually use one Aveeno wipe (out of a 25 wipe pack) at a time, and that will take off most or all of my waterproof eye makeup (yknow, assuming it is wet enough) and then will go over my whole face with one of the Simple Micellar wipes to make sure any oiliness is gone. There are still times where I don't get all of the eye makeup off, because I pile it on. Often what is left is mascara, and I either give up, or will go over my lashes with another wipe OR use one of the Ocusoft scrub pads to get it off. \n\nI felt due to the size of the Urban Decay wipes that I needed two. I probably didn't, but for the sake of comfort, I did use two. Given that 100 come in the pack, even if I use two at a time, I will still get twice as much out of this pack assuming it doesn't dry out before I run out.  I still used the Simple wipe afterward, because again, oily.  I did not really have anything left on my eyes or lashes afterwards, and didn't feel like I needed to go over my lashes or eyes at all. There might be a tiny bit of something still on there, but not enough that I feel like I need to worry about it. I'd go to bed like this.   Tonight I have boxing, so I will still shower, so I don't care--I'll be washing my face again.\n\nBefore/After photos, try not to have nightmares:\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/P4MOMdb\n\nB:  http://imgur.com/qmJiPAq\n\nA:  http://imgur.com/1BbCxIF\n\n\n\n*Pricing:*\n\nThe price difference is significant, but I felt worthwhile.  The Aveeno wipes are around $6.99 (at Target) for a pack of 25. The Urban Decay were $20 for a pack of 100. So basically to get as many Aveeno wipes as UD wipes, you'd pay $27.96 assuming you didn't find them on sale/coupon deal. Though, I guess considering you're using two UD wipes, it's really half that, so $13.98, given I need one Aveeno for every two UD wipes (need...maybe. Used, yes.) And again, that assumes the Aveeno ones are not dried out. \n\n\n\n*Ingredients:*\n\nI took a photo of the package, it's not great. \nhttp://imgur.com/Gqw4mWc\n\nList is:\n\nWater, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Gluconolactone, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Olive Oil, Lavender Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Calcium Gluconate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Chloride, Rice Bran Extract, Tocopheryl, Malic Acid, Sunflower Extract, Rosemary Leaf Extract\n\n\nBut this product has five natural oils in it, vs none in the Aveeno.  Here's the list from Ulta on the Aveeno:\n\nWater, Isononyl Isononanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Isostearyl Palmitate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Sucrose Cocoate, Fragrance, Carbomer, PEG-4 Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Chrysanthemum Parthenium(Feverfew) Flower/Leaf/Stem Juice, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract.  The package says there's a 3 month shelf life, which I think given the ingredient list is interesting, though, it's heavy on the natural oils, and maybe they're less stable?  Compared to the Aveeno list, it's significantly more natural. \n\n\n\n*Bottom Line:*\n\nI am pretty impressed after one use. I will see how I feel after several more. I want to see if they dry out and how quickly they dry out if they do.   But efficacy in the first use made them worth my while. \n\nedited to correct stupid typo\n\n\n**24 hours later update:**\n\nI just did my second use today and I was able to use ONE wipe this time (well that was my requirement of myself this time), and it worked just fine, both eyes completely clean. I followed with the Simple Micellar wipe all over and briefly around my eyes, bec I am just that anal, and my face is spiffy.  Then I just applied my serums and all that after like normal.  *Fingers crossed* that my face doesn't lose it's marbles with all the natural oils. ",

These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale.

    "body": "Hi All,\n\n\n\nSomeone posted a thread asking for an affordable sunscreen recommendation, and I thought I'd share the comment again.\n\nI actually made a post about it last year, but obviously it's gone to the bottom of the list. I hope it's okay to post about it again, since summer is very soon.\n\n\nI also kind of want more people to buy it. It feels sad that not many people know about it, when in my opinion it's really good. I have tried la Roche posay, nivea uv face, and I really think this one is better. But of course be careful and check the ingredient list!\n\n\nHere was my comment:\n\n\nI really like the asda sun cream which I have been using for 2 years now since discovering it one day - ASDA Protect SPF 50+ Face Q10 Anti-Age Sun Cream. I have the most sensitive skin, probably one of the most sensitive skin types you will ever meet due to my chronic eczema, and this one doesn't irritate me at all. To be honest, in the last year my eczema has been under control, and I was using this, so I can't say that it worsened my skin.\n\n\nIts only £2.40 so I think it's worth a try, and its UVA rating is very high- more than my nivea face uv sunscreen for £15ish (which burns my eyes). The only issue is that it's not matte. For me that's ok, as it covers my cracked and flaky skin. But you might want to try their matte version, which is the same price. If you want to try this one I am happy to take a picture/video of its consistency for you?\n\n\nHere are its ingredients:\nAqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Tapioca Starch, Coco-Caprylate, Undecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Silica, Panthenol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Tridecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Xanthan Gum, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Ubiquinone, Sodium Hydroxide, Carbomer, Benzyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citronellol, Limonene, Tocopherol, Linalool, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\n\n\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.",

        "body": "Hey OP, just wanted to give my opinion on this. After seeing this post I went out and grabbed some as I have an ASDA close-by. I have dry-normal sensitive skin and wanted to give it a try considering the great price. Only been using it today so its only a first impression but so far, so good! \n\nNo cast, sinks in nicely though it did leave me a bit greasy initially but after 10 mins or so it faded and looked normal, can barely tell I even had it on. I cut out my morning moisturizer as I figured it would be rich enough to cover that as well and I was right. I definitely wouldn't moisturize then apply this, the SPF is all I need. \n\nI have notoriously sensitive eyes so admittedly I haven't tried it in that area yet as I had to go out and didn't want to risk burning eyes so I used my usual SPF (the bondi sands one) and then applied the ASDA one everywhere else and I've had no issues. \n\nI will be trying it around the eyes tomorrow though as I'm not going anywhere. You may have just saved me a lot of future money OP so thanks! Even if it doesn't work around the eyes I can at least apply it to the rest of the face and use my usual in that area meaning it will last longer so its win/win really.\n\nUPDATE: So I've now tried it around the eyes and it felt fine for the first couple of hours, however after that I did experience some very mild burning in the eye area. Having said that, when I say \"very mild\" I mean really, really mild. If I was out and about I probably wouldn't even notice it as it only lasted a couple of minutes and then stopped. \n\nI would still class this as a success. Mild for me is still an improvement over most SPF's I've tried since my eyes are so sensitive. I will continue to use this and possibly just use my usual SPF around my eyes and the ASDA one on the rest of my face. Which will make my more expensive one last a lot longer since its only going to be used in the eye area.",

I can eat ANY NOODLE DISH with basically ZERO CALORIES from the noodles. It's insane, I can't believe it. \n\nI'm not joking I'm making Mac n cheese next..it's going to be 160 calories per BIG BOWL. \n\nWhy doesn't everyone just eat these when trying to lose weight??\n\nEdit. I totally agree with you, they are completely neutral flavored noodles... Meaning they absorb every flavor around them. I made a spicy pork the other night and it was literally delicious, didn't taste like diet food at all. If these noodles were in a ramen I couldn't tell that they weren't ramen noodles, lol. \n\nImagine if coke released regular coke but... It had zero calories. Without tasting diet.",

    "body": "Hey everyone -- there's a lot of detail below, but it's organized as favorite to least favorite. And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

I preheat my steel pan to about 160°F before adding my room temperature eggs. They always need a considerable amount of encouraging for my spatula to stop sticking to the pan. After I get them, unstuck, they glide across my pan no problem. Do you guys have any advice for how to cook eggs without having them stick?\n\nEdit: I do cook with oil (sunflower seed oil) and add it once my pan reaches 160°F, then I let the oil heat up for a minute or so. Also, I would use a cast-iron pan if I had one. The simple fact is I don’t and it’s not in the budget right now, so I wanna make do with what I have.",

Once it’s cooled a bit, put it back in the heat till it’s as hot as you want and start cooking. The way this works is the pan has micro pores that enlarge when you heat, then you add colder food and it causes them to contact and grab your food. By doing this heat, cool, heat process the pores have oil in them and won’t grab onto your food.",

        "body": "There are two or three things you can do if you want an easy peasy fried egg without any crispy brown frilly edges on them.\n\n1. In a stainless steel pan (used ONLY these from the time I was 10 years old till I was 45 years old).  Put the pan on medium high heat for at least 3 minutes while you get your eggs out of the fridge and grab butter, a pan lid, S&P, a bit of cold water and the plate you want to put the eggs on.\n2. After 3 minutes, plop a hefty tablespoon of butter in the pan.  If the pan is larger than 6 inches, add 2 tablespoons of butter and you'd better be frying at least 6 eggs..lol.  Immediately turn the heat to low.  About one click above the lowest setting for electric, medium low for gas.\n3. Swirl the butter around till it's melted and just starting to look foamy.  Now crack in the eggs, then add 2 tablespoons of water.  Salt and pepper the tops, then add the lid.  Set your timer for 4 minutes.  Check after the timer goes off and continue cooking for an extra minute if the whites look jiggly and not set.\n4. Slide the eggs out of the pan onto your plate and enjoy.\n\nNOTE:  You might have to try this at least 3 times in order to adjust your personal cooking times and temps.  Mine works at medium low on gas for 4 minutes,  but yours will probably vary by as much as a minute either way.\n\nOther option:  Buy a small  non-stick pan and be worry free.  They cook eggs beautifully on medium low heat and so long as you don't scrape them up and don't put them in the dishwasher and ONLY use them for eggs (and grilled cheese sammies), they will last for years.\n\nThird thing is scrambled eggs in a stainless steel pan.  The same basic princicples apply for both fried, shirred (that's with the lid on and a little water added to steam the tops of the eggs) and scrambled.  Heat the pan on medium high heat, melt the butter till it's just frothy, add the water directly to the eggs, then whisk well and pour them into the hot pan.\n\nFor scrambled:  Turn the heat to medium low and gently stir the eggs around the pan till you get the curd size you want and they are soft set.  Eggs do a lot of carry over cooking, so don't cook them till they are completely set in the pan!  They will finish cooking on your plate.\n\nFor Omelets: Turn the heat to medium low and lift the eggs from the edges as they start to cook and set.  When you lift, tip the pan to allow the uncooked egg to run underneath the cooked part.  Go around the pan to do this.  After you've lifted and tipped twice (About 1 minutes apart), the egg will be set enough for you to add any fillings.  Add them, then set the lid on and wait 1 more minutes.  Flip the omelet over on itself - in half.  Or roll it gently if you prefer that style of presentation.",

    "body": "Warning this post is a long one:\n\nSo I went to cancel my base box and saw that Boxycharm had already put some spoilers up for the upcoming pop up sale, (someone made a posted already with the items, so you can see it there) obviously the lovely 111SKIN item caught my eyes.  As of right now base on the price of $24, I’m incline to believe the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask shown on the picture would be a “real” 111SKIN item, made in the same factory in UK as the other 111SKIN items that gets sent to Saks, SpaceNK, CultBeauty, their actual website.  So yay no fake “made in China for 111SKIN” crap, where the ingredients for the same 2 products are miles apart and completely different (see my post on Avant and 111skin, if you’re interested). \n\nSo is the real 111SKIN made in UK Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask that has a RV of $200 worth it? Let’s have a look.  \n\nFor people who aren’t skincare nerds, a moisturizer/night mask (basically the same, especially this one since it tells you to apply on dry skin, I’m guessing 111SKIN wants you to use this instead of a moisturizer at night) should always contain these 3 different types of ingredients, occlusives, humectants, and emollients. (For more detailed info on these types of ingredients, read the long explanation at the end).  \n\nFor now I’ll get to the short definitions\n\n- Occlusives are ingredients that form a seal around the skin and traps water in order to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Having hydrated skin is very important in age prevention.  Depending on the occlusive ingredient, it can also prevent irritants, pollution, dirt, etc from. coming in contact with the skin.  Common occlusive ingredients: sunflower seed oil, silicones, squalane, beeswax and carnauba wax, Shea, cocoa, mango butters, mineral oil (nothing wrong with mineral oil I go further into details about this later on), lanolin. \n\n- Humectants are “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information).  Common humectants used in moisturizers: glycerin, hyaluronic acid (and its many forms such as sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid etc), amino acids, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, aloe vera.  \n\n- Finally we have emollient type ingredients, they are used in moisturizers to soften and smooth the skin, also it acts as a lubricating agent, if you have cracked and flaky skin emollients can help fill the the open spaces with fatty acids (lipids) and prevent water loss.  Now many occlusive ingredients are also going to be emollient ingredients as well (like beeswax and carnauba wax) common emollient ingredients used, borage seed oil, Shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, cholesterol. \n\nSo now we’ve listed the 3 types of ingredients that make up moisturizers (obviously other types of ingredients like antioxidants, texture enhancer, preservatives etc are also in moisturizers but these 3 are the building blocks/foundation of any moisturizer).  \n\nIngredients of the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask (ingredients list taken from 111skin.com):\n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN (a very good start, glycerin is one of the best humectants, and it’s the 2nd ingredient which probably means they are going for the gel like texture for this product), PANTHENOL (Vitamin B5, like glycerin it’s a great humectant.  Draws water from the air and from the deeper layers of the skin to the top layer so that it can plump out the skin thus wrinkles and fine lines look less visible and skin feels smoother.  Its also an excellent soothing ingredient, helping reduce inflammation, redness, irritation.  It helps to repair and strengthen the skin’s protective barrier and its a great antioxidant.), XANTHAN GUM (and here’s where the good for skin ingredients end, xanthan gum excellent thickening agent and texture enhancer It’ll make formulas that’s too watery more gel like.  However the typical concentration of xanthan gum in products are between 0.1% to 0.5%, now this being the 4th ingredient means again 111SKIN wants a gel texture for this overnight mask, cos this is most likely 2 or 1%.  Xanthan gum is perfectly safe and natural it’s just a chain of sugar molecules), ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER (another ingredient used to thicken products/viscosity control.  Now the presence of xanthan gum in high concentrations, and now this ingredient makes me think the Meso Overnight Mask is mostly made of water hence why there’s all these thickening agents, even glycerin has a syrup like texture, so not watery), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (a vitamin c derivative that’s very stable and is used in Olehenriksen’s Truth Serum, it’s an antioxidant and an active ingredient that should be the 2nd or 3rd on the list, as the 6th ingredient I’m guessing the concentration is below 1%, what is the point of having below 1% vitamin c derivative especially since they are less effective than vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) plus I don’t see any other powerful antioxidants in this product, yes there’s panthenol but that doesn’t require vitamin c derivative to boost its effectiveness, unlike having vitamin e will increase the effectiveness of vitamin c), NATTO GUM (created through the fermentation of a proprietary strain of bacteria (the safe kinds), not enough research on this one, may become a potent antioxidant), PHENOXYETHANOL (preservatives), SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE(another bloody ingredient that’s used to make something more viscous in texture, so basically it thickens the formula to form a gel, okay we get it 111SKIN you like gel textures), SODIUM HYALURONATE (wow a humectant, salt form of hyaluronic acid), PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (an emulsifier that’s amber/yellowish in colour (and that’s the colour of the Meso Overnight Mask) its used to solubilized fragrances into water based formulas, it really seems like there’s a lot of water in this product), SORGHUM BICOLOR STALK JUICE (not much information on this one besides skin conditioning agent, soften and hydrates, maybe? But some sites will tell you that it’ll tighten skin and creates a immediate lifting effect.  Again until I find a study or a ton of anecdotal evidence, I’ll call bs on the tightening and lifting claims for now), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN (preservative), SODIUM HYDROXIDE (a very alkaline pH adjuster), SODIUM BENZOATE (preservative against fungi, not strong enough to work by itself so it’s usually combined with the next ingredient, works best at acidic pH of 3-5, our skin’s natural pH levels are usually between 5.5 to 6.5), POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative thats not strong and often is paired with the previous ingredient) PENTYLENE GLYCOL (a humectant, also makes product feel nice on the skin), HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT (antioxidant, antibacterial, not sure why it’s at the end of the ingredients list in such low concentrations), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (it’s a humectant, but it’s mainly used cos of its ability to boost the effectiveness of other preservatives mainly phenoxyethanol, there are sure a lot of preservatives on this ingredient list), PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.\n\nSo here’s the breakdown of the $200 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask. NO OCCLUSIVES, NO EMOLLIENTS, the best ingredient is the panthenol, but without any occlusive/emollients ingredients everything will evaporate right off the skin that also will take moisture from your own skin too!  After analyzing the ingredients list of this lovely $200 product I’m incline to believe it’s basically water.  I like the panthenol but La Roche Pasay Cicaplast Balm B5 is so better, and it also has a gel version, it’s also $15. \n\nSeriously wtf is 111SKIN thinking? I can’t even consider this as a moisturizer or serum or overnight mask or toner, I don’t know what kind of product this is....cos from looking at the ingredients it’s just water with panthenol and a lot of THICKENING AGENTS to get that gel texture.  \n\nBelow are more information on occlusives, humectants and emollients if you’re interested feel free to have a look: \n\nOcclusives are ingredients that form a physical barrier around your face so that all the moisture from serums and moisturizer won’t evaporate off the skin making it drier, you’ll often hear dermatologists refer to this as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), for obvious reasons having a hydrated skin will contribute greatly to age prevention.  They also act as a shield protecting the skin from physical irritates, pollution, etc, think of occlusive ingredients as a saran wrap for your face or body, except it only traps the water and keep out irritates especially for people who have compromised skin barriers.  Some examples of widely used occlusives are: \n\n- Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter \n\n- Petroleum jelly and by default mineral oil since it’s derived from petroleum, for reasons unknown the Clean Beauty Movement has demonized Vaseline (and mineral oil) and it’s been made out to be this monster that’ll take your first born and use it as a sacrifice, but it’s still one of the best occlusive ingredients we have, quote from one study on moisturizers “Petrolatum in a minimum concentration of 5% reduces TEWL by more than 98% followed by lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.”obviously it’s less cosmetically elegant (it’s grease) but perfectly safe to use the molecules are too big to get into the skin that’s why it makes such a good barrier ESPECIALLY for people who suffer from compromised skin barrier issues (eczema, psoriasis etc) and when you’ve messed up your skin barrier with too much retinol and exfoliating acids.  The new trend in Korea is I think called “slipping”? Where people put on a layer of Vaseline before bed to stop TEWL.  As for people with oily skin maybe stay away from this one. \n\n- Squalane, soy, sunflower oil, lecithin\n\n- Cholesterol and ceramides (two important skin lipids that can be found in the famous Skinceuticals moisturizer 2:4:2 (the first 2 are two different ceramides, 4 is 4% cholesterol, and the last 2 are fatty acids, it looks like they used sunflower seed oil)\n\n- Beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax\n\n- Lanolin, silicones \n\nSorry for rambling, next important class of ingredients are humectants, “compounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.” (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information). Common humectants used are:\n\n- Glycerin \n\n- Propylene glycol (again the Clean Beauty Industry has labelled this one as antifreeze and brake fluid....long story short, it’s not and safe to use), hexylene glycol, butylene glycol.\n\n- Hyaluronic acid and it’s many forms, like sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate etc \n\n- Lactic acid, PHA (the acids that’s in Glow Recipe’s toner, or Olehenriksen’s Phat Mask) it’s a very gentle exfoliating acid and they also retain moisture. \n\n- Urea, amino acids \n\n- Aloe Vera \n\nFinally we get to last category of ingredients, emollient ingredients are used in moisturizer to make your skin soft and smooth like a new born baby (I wish it were that easy). They are usually lipids (fatty acids, which are super important to a healthy skin barrier) and oils,  a lot of occlusives are also emollients.  Common emollients found in moisturizers (some are also occlusives) \n\n- Lanolin \n\n- beeswax \n\n- Shea butter \n\n- Jojoba oil \n\n- Castor oil \n\n- Moringa seed oil \n\n- Linoleic acid\n\nTL:DR : even if the 111SKIN Overnight Mask in the pop up spoiler is real as in made in UK with all the other real products that’s going to be sold in Saks, CultBeauty, SpaceNK etc, it’s still junk, beyond junk, it’s basically water, and then a lot of ingredients to make the water into a gel, the ONLY beneficial ingredients are panthenol (vitamin B5), glycerin, and hyaluronic acid....seriously that’s it, all those ingredients are available in the Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum.",

I haven’t been able to handle rubbing on moisturizer, so hoping a body wash can provide some relief. \n\n3) smells (flowers, citrus, cotton, etc.) overwhelm my system. I have even found some “unscented” has an alcoholic scent that I cannot tolerate.

The making process between hard bar soap and liquid soap is similar, but differs primarily in the saponification process (saponification = combining fats, water, and lye under specific conditions). Bar soap uses sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and liquid soaps uses potassium hydroxide (KOH). Soap batter with NaOH in a mold will harder. Soap batter with KOH turns into a sticky paste that must be diluted with water after the saponification process is complete.   \n\n\nIf they are following labeling best practices, coconut oil would be the highest quantity of oils. And a soap recipe will be about 65% oils, all said and done (counting the water, additives like kaolin clay and scents, the like). That would potentially be a LOT of coconut oil in their recipe, which is not a choice I would make.   \n\n\nI would recommend using a different soap. \n\nTo clear out my drains when things are running slow, I periodically run some Thrift and hot water down the drain. Thrift is sodium hydroxide as well (science is fun!) and if you've never handled it before, be sure to read up on safety instructions. Thrift (NaOH) is caustic and when combined with water, it creates a good amount of toxic vapor and undergoes an exothermic reaction (gets really hot!).",

This saponifies the oil and converts it to soap, which will then dissolve in water and flush away.  (If you use hot water alone, you may melt it at the site of the clog, allowing it to flow away, but it will just flow downstream and then form a new clog as it cools.)\n\nFor treating (2):  Firstly, this is only likely if your water is hard.  Some regions use well water and that can sometimes have high level of calcium and magnesium carbonate and/or other salts.  These will react with soap (but not detergent) to form \"soap scum,\" or the calcium salts of the saponified fats.  There are numerous web sites that recommend baking soda plus vinegar for removal of soap scum accumulations.  If this is your problem, your long term solution is to switch to using detergent instead of soap or get a water softener.",

Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

    "body": "AKA: My Journey to Cutting Out Silicones\n\n**Burt's Bees Anti-blemish Solutions Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis moisturizer is available in drugstores. I got mine at Walmart. It costs about $25 CAD for 55g. I call this price range ‘drugstore bougie’, basically not expensive in general but pricey for a drug store product. Nonetheless, you can find it pretty widely and also online with no problems.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is definitely nice. It comes in a box. And when you pull it out, it's a heavy (glass, I believe) bottle with a cap over the pump. It looks good on a shelf. It has a moderate smell. It's definitely a good, slightly sweet smell.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely a heavier moisturizer. Iffy ‘cause it's advertised as lightweight. One pump adequately covers my face and neck with no problem. It's a little sticky for a while but it did provide moisture. My skin was soft but it itched and broke out in CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nOnce I got into skincare, I took another look at the ingredients here. The moisturizer has salicylic acid at 1% which is the acne-fighting ingredient. For hydration/moisture, I see glycerin. Then it has a lot of plant oils and extracts including sunflower seed oil, willow bark extract, lemongrass extract, hops extract, horsetail leaf extract, goldenseal extract, gravel willow extract and carrageenan extract. These can all be irritating. It also contains fragrance and witch hazel water. I wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty-free and uses mostly natural ingredients.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAlthough not for me, this might be a product that works for you if you have tolerant skin that needs a little boost in the form of a product that moisturizes well and offers some anti-acne properties. No matter your skin type and concerns, there's probably something better out there for you.\n\n2/5\n\n**Neutrogena Oil-free Moisture for Combination Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis is also a drugstore product widely available. I got mine at Walmart for $14 CAD. I have also seen it at other drug stores and online. This is one you probably won't have trouble finding. They also make variations for different skin types.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nIts packaging is simple. It's a sleek white design. It has the type of pump that twists, so you can control the amount that flows out. There's no cap but you can lock the pump with the twisting. It's hardy plastic that holds up well even though I really tossed it around. It sid stain a little from my foundation (I would mix the two on occasion).\n\nApplication\n\nIt applies as a gel cream. It feels light and thin. Maybe too thin. It dries down matte even if you mix in oils and mattifies if you layer oils on top. It made my skin tight, which was my first sign I shouldn't have used this product continually. But of course I kept using it anyway due to its ingredient list, then started experiencing itchiness and CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nHonestly, the ingredients look pretty good. For moisture/hydration, I'm seeing glycerin. It's fairly simple and the only thing that is a concern for some is the presence of silicones. Little did I know… \n\nOther\n\nThis product is neither cruelty free nor natural.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHonestly, I think this is a good moisturizer. I like that it's mattifying. I think it would be great for oily skin and combo skin that leaned further towards oily. My skin is dehydrated and leaning towards dry, so it makes sense it wasn't enough moisture for me. The silicones won't bother most people and it's a good no-frills moisturizer.\n\n2/5 for me, 4/5 for the better-suited consumer\n\n**Equate Soft Moisturizing Cream**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Equate brand is Walmart's generic. This product is a dupe for Nivea soft moisturizing cream. You can get this in physical walmart locations or online through the walmart site. It's very affordable at $6 CAD for 200ml.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is simple and white. The product is in a tub. It's a really thick cream so this is best and I don't really have complaints.\n\nApplication\n\nIt goes on thick and heavy. I didn't like the way it felt, except that it stayed cold in my bathroom and felt refreshing. I experienced a negative reaction very quickly with this one. I was itchy right away. I used it at night and woke up in the morning with itchy red hives on one cheek. I had a job interview that morning… fun. I also experienced my existing CCs becoming red and inflamed with use of this product near it.\n\nIngredients\n\nLooking at the ingredients, I wanted to kick myself. For hydration/moisture, the product has glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, jojoba oil and lanolin alcohol. I had thought that fragrance was the only irritant and sometimes I can get away with that low on the ingredients list. But I found myristyl alcohols and myristyl myristate are commonly irritating and potentially comedogenic. This moisturizer also has silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis brand's cruelty-free status is unknown. They seem to say they don't test on animals.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI don't like this even on my body, which is extra dry. I just hate it. It's too heavy and too irritating for me. Honestly wouldn't recommend unless you really need a heavy night cream and are okay with the ingredients mentioned above. I thought it would help my winter skin. It didn't.\n\n1/5 for me, maybe 2.5/5 for others\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Ordinary is very affordable. This moisturizer costs $5.80 CAD for 30ml or $7.70 CAD for 100ml. It's available online and at Deciem stores and I believe online-only at Sephora. Shipping is very reasonable.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is really cute. It comes in a white plastic tube coated in silver. It's a simple design that's nice to look at.\n\nApplication\n\nI love that this product is so versatile with how you can apply it. A little goes a long way if you want it to. I layer this stuff on, starting with a coat on wet skin and ending with a layer of the moisturizer mixed with rosehip oil. It sinks in so quickly. It leaves me feeling moisturized but not too shiny or greasy. I love the texture of this. A thick cream that applies thin, basically.\n\nIngredients\n\nThis product contains a lot of barrier-restoring essentials by focusing on the natural moisturizing factors our skin creates on its own. You see glycerin, hyaluronic acid, amino acids, allantoin, linoleic and oleic acids.There are no common irritants, fragrances, essential oils, or silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty free\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI love this stuff. It's so versatile. It holds up to wear alone if your skin is really oily and can be layered very well if your skin is really dry. I recommend this especially if you have sensitive skin and are looking for something ‘safe’ for your skin. This is a good place to start. I think it will work out for most.\n\n5/5\n\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Cream for Extra Dry Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nAnother drugstore bougie, this product is $20-25 CAD for 47ml. It's available most everywhere though. I bought mine on Amazon at $2 off, so I paid $18.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is lovely. It's a heavy tub in blue with a white lid. It is just really cute. It looks like it contains more than it does. A little bit of wasted material at the base.\n\nApplication\n\nI applied this on wet skin right out of the shower. I followed up with The Ordinary NMF and rosehip oil. I liked the way it felt at first. It was cool and light. Within 3 uses, I was breaking out, itchy, and getting little CCs in new places. All of my previous breakouts got so much more inflamed and swollen. This reaction led me to a comparison spree between a lot of products that broke me out, looking for the most likely culprits. And now I'm thinking silicones.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look fine. It has glycerin and hyaluronic acid for hydration. It's fragrance-free and doesn't have any common irritants to my knowledge. The ingredient list is fairly simple. It's really *just* silicones for me. And there are a lot of them.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is not cruelty-free.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI wish I could love this but it didn't love me. So I have to find something similar because it feels good. I would recommend this if you're not sensitive to silicones and are struggling with moisture retention, dryness, or damaged moisture barriers.\n\n1.5/5 for me, maybe 4/5 for others\n\n**Indeed Laboratories Hydraluron Moisture Jelly**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nYet another drugstore bougie racking up at $25 CAD for 30ml. Why yes, it's tiny. Hopefully it lasts a while. I got mine at Shoppers Drug Mart. I believe they're a Canadian brand. I haven't seen them online (other than at their own site) but I think it's available to North America as a whole and probably internationally.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nI was really impressed by the packaging on this one. It's really cute, like *seriously* cute. And it has a pump?! Honestly was psyched to see this on a gel product rather than a tub  or squeeze tube. I prefer it for portioning and reduced waste. I believe it’s an airless pump. Which is good because I want every cent of this product on my face. The product is not open to the air and comes out through pin-sized holes. You don't even need a whole pump.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely more of a true gel than the Neutrogena and it's cool, light, and refreshing. It leaves no stickiness as it dries (I apply on wet skin). And it layers perfectly under other moisturizers, absorbing right into my skin. Even in trouble spots. I use a small amount, about half a pump. I think it's really great.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look good here. For hydration, I see glycerin, urea, and hyaluronic acid. There are no fragrances, essential oils, irritants or silicones. Very simple ingredient list. Also, if you look at the Indeed Laboratories site, it will show you the function of each ingredient when you hover.\n\nOther\n\nThis is a cruelty free product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a recent addition to my routine, but I am loving it. I am so happy to use this. In only a few days of using this (+TO rosehip oil and natural moisturizing factors), I can already see my skin clearing up. I have great hopes for continued use of this.",

    "body": "I’ve been collecting Darling Clandestine scents for about a year, and as I begin to destash the ones I just couldn’t fall in love with, I thought I’d give them one last sniff and review before sending them on their way. \n\nDC has some of my most adored scents, but TAT is usually fulfilled at the very, very tail end. I admit that I'm one of many who blind buys just for her evocative prose descriptions. Something I strongly feel should be noted is just how much larger her bitsies and full size bottles are, especially compared to other brands samples and full sizes. It’s kind of outrageous, and you can see comparison photos [here](http://imgur.com/a/oUvRt). I get good sillage, throw, and longevity with DC. I've found the oils are more complex than the solids. Lastly I’ll just go ahead and mention that I like dark, moody scents and florals, and that probably biases my reviews.\n\n**Monstre Delicat**: *“Clean, spicy, rain, moody...Sweet blackened fig, rain water, spiced wood. The nostalgic longing for storms...A haunting watercolor ‘blue’ scent.”*\n\nThis is one of those beautiful ‘this replicates an experience’ scents. It’s absolutely like a portrait of a rainy day when your heart is breaking. Cool, blue, watery, sad, but still refined, like staring out your rain-soaked window in a silk slip, looking effortlessly beautiful as your heartbreaks for a man who is impossibly handsome.\n\n**Mad As Birds**: *“Sweet, cool, fresh dew with notes of pear and mint and amber and marigolds.”* \n\nI'm not a fruit scent kind of gal but this is so much more than that. Very juicy and cheerful, sunny and deep, and yet cool and sophisticated. I know it sounds like I just strung a bunch of opposing adjectives together and I'm sorry. \n\n**Mayfly**: *\"Opens very bright, deceptively sweet and floral, mellows to soft, moody, rainy stone and woods.”*\n\nThis one is sharply green, not woody green but hot, bright green, the kind that has no place in cooler weather. And then it settles down to rain on hot city sidewalks before becoming blue and moody. The watery dry down reminds me of Monstre Delicat. This one's an experience for me in the same way that Sixteen92's Supercell is.\n\n**Blue Valentine**: *“This one will make you die a little more each Saint Valentine’s Day. A moody bouquet of hyacinth and violet and poppies and figs, washed down with shots of real whiskey and bitters and delicate musks and mint. Very potent, very heady.”*\n\nWanted to love because, duh, Tom Waits. Except wearing it I just smell like powdery florals and am in no way reminded of Tom Waits. Even after aging it, I just want to scrub it off. The boozy notes are null and void both on me and in the bottle, but I imagine they would have really grounded this scent. Yes, potent and heady, but just for powdery florals and rubbing alcohol alone. This is the scent that taught me that I don’t do violets, and for whatever reason, DC features that note a lot. Surely there are more flowers out there? I’d like to see a darker, moodier, more insidious scent for Tom Waits. \n\n**Limerence:** *“A floral for those who hate florals. Not ‘oriental’ or grandmotherly, but a green, tangy, moody blend of bruised Casablanca lilies, bittersweet succulents, full-bodied herbal essentials, a heady crust of sea salt, and a wonderfully fine mitti attar that’s the essence of first rain hitting sun-baked earth.”*\n\nNot in any way a powdery, grandmotherly, nauseating, dry, musky flowers floral, but the most realistic scent of fresh flowers I’ve found. This is like walking into a bright flower shop full of freshly cut flowers all misted with water, or burying your head in a bouquet, inhaling the water in the vase and the woody stems. Beautiful.\n\n**Harpy**: *“Sea salt and dark bay rum and lime and milk and coconut and a bit of banana. A lovely seaside scent with a bit of a bite.”*\n\nGreeted immediately by a tropical, nutty lime scent. This one definitely springs to mind beaches and vacation without the strawberry daiquiri kind of feel. This one is fun without being insipid. /u/eraser_dust said in a review that this has a zing that reminded her of lightning over an ocean, and I definitely encountered it. \n\n**La La La Alright**: *\"I built this scent on Rock’n’Roll. Sun-drenched summer breezes and road trips and cornfields and river and road. This is a very green, very earthy scent, with a similar accord to that of Fisticuffs, minus the sweetness.\"*\n\nThis one filled me with momentous anticipation, because I am *so, so* into rock and roll and road trip scents...and then it totally bummed me out. If I hadn’t already owned Mayfly I may have liked it, but to my nose, this is almost identical to Mayfly. The descriptions and reviews said this was really, really green, but I don’t get that whatsoever. It’s very lemongrassy sweet and watery blue. I’d say Mayfly is the green one and La La La is much more blue. And it’s candy sweet. Not evocative of road trips with CCR blasting from the mono speakers, unfortunately.\n\n**Mishigami**: *“Inspired by that greatest of lakes, Lake Michigan, and all its moods and shores. Much more than an ‘aquatic’ fragrance, this has indescribably, sandy death.”*\n\nA salty-sandy-nutty base with something sharply clean overpowering it, like a bodywash might be. Maybe because it’s in solid form and I don’t get a lot of depth, or maybe because I haven’t been to Lake Michigan (though I live near Lake Eerie and used to live by the ocean?), but this one was unremarkable for me. A clean scent, which I've noticed sea-type scents usually revert to.\n\n**Cloudswing**: *\"A tumble in the hay! Lemongrass and vanilla and resiny wood and marigolds and new-mown clover and sun.\"*\n\nSimply sweet lemongrass. Lemon in the woody way, not in the sharp/medicinal or cakey/gourmand kind of way. I’d have liked this one if it were more complex. I wish it had more of that clover and sun, like Sixteen92’s Grass Harp, underlaying it all. \n\n**Mare Desiderii**: *“Delicate, white, watery, ozoney. Water lotus blossoms splashed with crushed white grapes, yuzu and mandarin, pinched with green sprigs of plum. Ethereal and wonderful.”*\n\nFrom the container I get something sweet and fruity, but piercingly musky. There’s something pink and girly about it. On my skin, this is like that pink fabric softener. Feminine, plucky, and clean, like a scented dryer sheet. This one’s notes blend together well while standing their ground. Was expecting this to be very delicate and watery, but this is strongly fruity and girly. \n\n**Slippery:** *\"Wet and spicy, cool and pointy, and other jostled adjectives. Crushed calla lily, cornsilk, wasabi, a quartet of grasping lichens. A really dynamite \"upscale\" drydown.\"*\n\nRereading the scent description, I’m just like “HA. HA HA. HA.” Soap. Soap. Soap. Like the cheap soap that you have to use after the bathroom at a gas station that makes your hands dry. On the skin, it stays blegh-Dial-soap for a long while, before finally, finally drying down to something still sanitary and soapy, but just a teensy, tiny bit more watery and real. The last, dying notes are alright, but they’re not worth the $6 itsy-bitsy four-week-wait price tag. No lichens and wetness or lily or other fresh, cool notes. I’m sad.\n\n**Ballyhoo**: *\"A surprising melange of coffee and cream and lime and amber and ozone and a dozen other unlikely notes.\"*\n\nTop notes, just as the description says, of ozone and lime, something further down like coffee. Was hoping for that clean, zappy ozone scent and it did not disappoint, but on my skin it's just sweet, clean, briney lime. Was hoping for a darker coffee scent threaded through it.\n\n**Destiny Chose Tools**: *\"A breath through a dream tunnel, repeating. Delicate rice husk, seared sunflower, blanched aubergine.\"*\n\nIs it just me, or is DC getting lazy and more confounding with the scent descriptions (Boss Fight, anyone)? This one’s top notes are soapy and overlaying a kind of fatty nut oil. This one’s notes are evident--sunflower seeds and eggplant--but in no way reflect fall for me. This one dries down old lady-ish, if you can distinguish that scent from amber.  I wanted to love it because my field is anthropology and the name made me giddy, but this one makes me feel like I've been rubbing myself with sunflower seed oil and mothballs.\n\n**The Moon Is Leaving For The Wheels**: *\"The tang of tawny dead grasses, parched by sunset, dampened by first frost. Brooding vetiver, ripe blackberries, sweet Melissa, shy mosses, petitgrain twist.\"*\n\nIt doesn’t always happen, but sometimes I want something purely for the name. This is one of them. I played in a lot of fields and woods when I was a kid, and doing so on many autumn evenings is imprinted onto my brain. And with Evonne’s facebook status that declared that she wouldnt be taking the gourmand approach this autumn but would try to evoke fall outside, I was sold on the whole damned fall collection. The scent picture of a sunset and a frosted field, and the scent description, which promised frosty dried grasses and crisp air, and it was love at first read. \n\n...Except this was completely opposite. I was surprised on first sniff that it was so sweet. I expected something drier and cooler. There’s sweet blackberries in there, and that’s what reigns on me. Just sweet berries. ;__;\n\n**Vardogr**: *\"Dark, damp, herbal—mossy forest floors, sunken alleys, underground spaces—with a dozen unlikely notes including pure essential German chamomile, bitter black coffee, hazy Indian musks, sharp herbs and a whip of leather.\"*\n\nI got this originally as a free sniffy in a swap, and my sniffy impression was that this was like a moody, dark, herbal cologne, definitely masculine. I spent a lot of time playing in storm drains and creeks when I was young, so I went ahead and grabbed a bitsy to sample it further. AND OHMYGOD I’M SO GLAD I DID. I never want to go without this one. The herbal note in the listing initially turned me off because they often come off medicinal, but this one is woody green, damp, complicated and dark. It’s not overtly masculine on me, just really intriguing.\n\n**Love & Sharks**: *“Notes of salty smooth sharkskin, pink and black pepper, true black cherries and apricots and clove . . . oh, man, it's really indescribably wonderful, like all of you.”*\n\nThis is one of those well-blended ones where it’s impossible to pick up notes but just *is.* Skin musk, okay, I can smell that, and it smells feminine and bright and juicy, but I’m not pink or fruity kind of gal and this is just amazing. Just sexy and sultry and super, duper comforting. Don't be turned off by the shark skin; this isn't gross or weird. If you like Falchion or Inked, try it.\n\n**Serpentina**: *\"Green tea with a smoky opium bite.\"*\n\nThis one is just as described: musky green tea with opium. It reminded me instantly of a commercial green tea eau my mom bought me when I was a teenager, but less sweet and flowery. This one was okay, but I would have liked it if the ‘snarl’ ‘bite’ and ‘underside’ were more prominently featured. Uncomplicated, which is why I guess people direct newbies to it. The sort of scent I want to wear when I’m just out of the shower and feeling aloof.\n\n**Step Right Up**: *\"Blue-green, spicy, oceanic, fascinating. Very unisex. Created in cooperation with my brother Aaron, the Smeller of All Things, this scent is incredibly nostalgic---customers frequently tell me it reminds them of a certain place and time, but no two stories are the same.\"*\n\nReminds me instantly of commercial dude body wash. Has a peppery kick to it laid out on a base of “this is an ocean scent” which smells nothing like the ocean. It’s clean, it’s masculine, and it has a sort-of spicy background that makes me think of walking into Pier 1 Imports. Like body wash or deodorant scents? This one might float your boat. This one would smell great on a dude who isn’t discriminating or educated about colognes, only wishing that he smells like he showered with machismo.\n\n**Circassian**: *\"Bitter black coffee, spiced chocolate, ceremonial resins, with an intriguing floral note.\"*\n\nAt first whiff, I thought this was a basic coffee and chocolate scent. I haven’t always had good experiences with chocolate in perfume--though I’m a huge chocolate lover irl, anything that smells like chocolate but *isn't* chocolate can be cloying and artificial. But this chocolate note was smooth and robust. After settling on my skin, though, a fresh, deep, sophisticated floral unfurls under the yummy, warm mocha scent, and somehow works really, really well together. It hooked me. It’s comforting in that way you want your gourmands to be, but the perfumey complexity in the background takes it to a whole notha’ level. If you like interesting gourmands or florals, try it.\n\n**Falchion**: *\"Dark, earthy, sultry, musky, with a bit of chocolate...does open with a cinnamony kick.\"*\n\nThis one was love at first whiff. Opens chocolate-y instead of cinnamony for me, and in fact I haven’t caught wind of any cinnamon yet. Skin, sensual chocolate, and I don’t know what. There's something kind of dark and musky under it all that makes it lean masculine. This one is like a lot of DC scents in that it’s so well blended and complex that you can’t make heads or tails of what’s in it. I recommend this to everyone, though I shouldn't, because it's a strong scent. It’s just really sexy, but so, so comforting. It reminds me of drawing close to a mysterious, sexy man, because clearly I read too much romance. This was the first scent for which I banged my hand on the table and exclaimed, \"Full size immediately.\"\n\n**Inked**: *\"A sting of sea salt and leather, splashes of communion wine, the essence of raw skin.\"*\n\nHits pretty much all these notes, but prominently leather and skin. It’s grounded by the wine, and although I usually dislike boozy notes (on me they're just sour grapes or rubbing alcohol), the wine isn’t overpowering at all, just lends to this salty, leathery musk. Really like this one; it's got a similar accord to Falchion but it's less complex.\n\n**Supernova Sway**: *“If ‘black metallic’ had a fragrance, it would be this...dark and bright and dark and bright again, deep musks streaked with mint, black resins with subtle flashes of orchid and buttery honeysuckle.”*\n\nI didn’t expect to like this. I’d read some reviews and some people just seem confused and unattached to this scent. I also didn’t think I wanted to smell like metal. Except, somehow, this is a really sophisticated scent. It’s zingy and solid, like metal I suppose, but not the gut-churning-pennies-in-my-hands kind of metal, nor clinical, stainless steel metal, either. It’s cool, with the mint not really like “hai i’m here” but as a supporting character. But it has this flowery scent that threads through, and just like in the scent description, it’s there and then it’s not. It grew on me quickly. I like to put it on when I’m getting all dressed up and want to feel both feminine and bold. \n",

I was trying to stir in some spices after to create an aioli of sorts.  The stirring mostly seemed to be what caused the separation.  I’ve never had this happed with mayo made from sunflower seed oil, but I’m not crazy about the taste.   The avocado oil mayo was delicious the first night and seems fine in the fridge.  Anything I can do differently? ",

I can't tell you what happened with yours without knowing exactly what you did, but I can tell you it wasn't the oil because I've used it countless times and have never had any issue with it. \n\nIf you want to add flavorings, like lemon or herbs or garlic, do it before the initial refrigeration. Use egg yolks in place of whole eggs, or do a combination. And even though it sounds like it would be counter-intuitive, add a bit of water to them. Put 3 egg yolks into a processor and sprinkle them with 1/2 tsp coarse sea salt, then add 2 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp water. Pulse a couple times, then start the processor. Stream in 1 1/2 cups avocado oil, 1/2 cup at a time, in a very thin stream. It should take you about 3 minutes to incorporate all the oil. Add any flavoring ingredients at this point, folding in gently. Let sit for about an hour, then chill.",

    "body": "Kernel is the largest producer of sunflower seed oil in Ukraine, with 22% of sunflower seed crushing capacity in the country. The stock is traded in Poland but is headquartered in Kyiv. \n \nThe market cap is $1.6 billion and net debt is around $91 million, with a large cash position offset by debt. Almost all of its cash and debt are denominated in US dollars. Its revenue is typically received in dollars. \n \nPrior to the war, the company traded in the 6-12x earnings range, so not terrible high. But after the war started, sales dropped 35% and operating income dropped 50%. The war blocked the export of sunflower seed oil through Black Sea ports. However the company was able to continue to export through Danube River terminals. \n \nWorkforce was obviously impacted, as many employees were conscripted as soldiers. 56 employees died in the war as of 2024. However an end to the war would mean workforce returning and an ability to scale up to previous capacity and perhaps even build new plants. \n \nKernel had 9 total oilseed crushing plants, but 2 plants in Vovchansk and Prykolotne in the Kharkiv region were idled as they were in an active war zone. This leaves 7 plants that are actively operating. Historically the company has been able to produce up to 4 million tons of oilseeds. The company has actually built a new plant in Western Ukraine during the war which added 500,000 tons of capacity, and is currently at a run rate of 3.9 million tons of oilseed processing. Currently the company is operating at 85-90% of capacity utilization which is pretty good for a country at war. \n \nThe company sold 134,000 hectares of land for $210 million, pricing at about $1500 per hectare , but still holds 358,000 hectares of land in Ukraine. That means the remaining land is probably worth somewhere in the range of $561 million. I’d argue the land will be worth substantially more if a ceasefire is signed Thursday, and I think it’s plausible that Ukrainian land will be worth more than it was pre-war in a few years. \n \nThe company generated $480 million in operating income in the last 12 months, putting EV/EBIT around 3.5x. There are large asset write downs from the war and some insurance settlements which distort the income statement. If you subtract out $40 million in net interest expense and tax at 20%, the company should generate $350 million in net profit, for a trailing PE ratio of about 4.9X. \n \nSunflower seed oil production is a decent business. The company is typically able to generate a low-teens operating margin in upcycles for sunflower seed oil and a mid-single-digit margin in down cycles. The company has been consistently profitable for over 20 years including through the entire great financial crisis. The ROE is currently at 12%, but has been as high as 30% in upcycles. \n \nSunflower seed oil is currently at $1,320 per ton, and post-COVID has averaged between $800-$2,300 per ton. \n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine have already signed a critical mineral deal. Zelenskyy has said he is ready to meet with Putin on Thursday. Trump is rumored to be attending. Putin said publicly he was open to talks on Thursday but has not confirmed he would attend. The U.S. and Zelenskyy have both pressured Putin to agree to a 30 day ceasefire. \n \nA lot is riding on whether this actually happens or not. It may be worth it to initiate a position now to wait and see. In the downside, maybe you lose 30-50%, but at a multiple of 5x earnings the downside is limited. If a ceasefire is agreed upon, the left tail risks get cut off, and I’d guess the multiple expands. The prospects for better earnings with a returning workforce and free access to Black Sea ports would mean you could see substantial upside. \n \nWe will have to see where the territory lines are drawn but there’s a possibility the company could get back the plants in Vovchansk and Prykolotne as they are both under Ukrainian control currently. This would give capacity to scale up to 4.5 million tons of oilseed capacity and reverse some of the asset write downs in recent years. \n \nIm not sure what multiple would be appropriate here. My guess is the midpoint of the previous 6-12x earnings range, or about 9X earnings, which would be about 80% upside. Of course if revenue and earnings grow, new capacity is unlocked, or if there are positive surprises on the new territory maps, upside could be more substantial. \n \n\n\n \n",

    "body": "**SUMMARY**\n\nAs the reader can see, the use of drugs in the **Monarch Trauma-based Mind Control** is extensive and requires skilled technicians, nurses, and doctors.\n\nBecause of the long-held control by **the Illuminati** families over narcotics and drug manufacture/sales, there is no difficulty for the programmers to get large quantities of secret designer drugs. The minor occult cults have to get by with a more limited supply of mind altering drugs, unless they directly connect in with the bigger picture.\n\nThe power of drugs to control a person’s life is not absolute - although someone who lives with a cocaine addict or alcoholic might disagree - but when coupled with all the other methods in a sophisticated system of mind-control, drugs just further reinforce the absolute power of the Illuminati over an individual.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe science of **Pharmacology** (drugs) has given the Programmers a vast array of mind-altering and body-altering drugs. Some of the drugs are not used to directly alter the mind, but to change the body (makethe skin burn), or make the person vomit, or some other reaction that can be harnessed to further their nefarious programming goals. If they want a little girl to develop breasts they might give her hormones. Neuroscientists are now familiar with chemicals which cause personality traits.\n\nIf one wants to create raving paranoia, simply provide the brain with too much dopamine in the emotional centers of the brain and too little dopamine in the seat of reasoning area of the brain. Reduce serotonin in the person and the person will be unable to connect disagreeable consequences with what provoked them. In other words, they can’t protect themselves from danger.\n\nThorazine was used regularly at the CIA’s Jonestown, Guyana group control experiment. Survivors of Jonestown have testified as to its effectiveness. After this gruesome experiment in mind control came to its end with a massacre, large amounts of drugs were discovered. Just one footlocker at Jonestown alone contained 11,000 doses. The authorities prevented chemical autopsies of the bodies to insure secrecy of this sophisticated concentration camp which was used for medical and psychiatric experimentation by the **CIA**.\n\nAn examination of the drugs that are used in mental hospitals to alter the minds of patients offers a clear indication of what is being used in the **Monarch Mind Control programming**.\n\n**DRUGS USED FOR MIND CONTROL**\n\nThe **CIA/Illuminati programming centers** have more than 600-700 different drugs at their disposal.\n\nThe following is a partial list of the drugs available for their mind-control (aka MK-Ultra Programming). They can make a person feel like he is in heaven, or burning in hell. The drugs are at times used with elaborate light, sound and motion shows that produce whatever effect the programmer wants to produce.\n\nThey can make a person believe he is shrinking, or that he is double (with mirrors), or that he is dying. Before describing how drugs are used for programming & control, let us list a few which we know have been used. This list comes from CIA documents obtained from the Freedom of Information Act and from what Multiples used as Programmers remember.\n\nMany of the new synthetic drugs are known only to the **Illuminati/Intelligence community:**\n\n*   2-GB (aka CBR, this is a strong hallucinogenic which also helps telepathic communication)\n*   2-CT2 (produces dark, earthy visual patterns)\n*   Acetylcholine (for EEOM, EDOM, and for blocking memory)\n*   Adrenalin\n*   Aktetron\n*   Alcohol\n*   Ambien\n*   Aminazin\n*   Amobarbital (hypnotic sedative)\n*   Amobarbital sodium (hypnotic sedative)\n*   Amphetamine (addictive)\n*   Amphetamine sulphate\n*   Analasine\n*   Anectine (succinylcholine, a strong muscle relaxant that makes one feel suffocated and drowning.

The medieval witches used potions of hemlock and aconite for their flying ointments. These are herbs (natural drugs) which will create delirium. Contemporary witnesses reported that covens during the medieval ages would apply the potion of hemlock and aconite to cause their new witch to go delirious, and then would transport the person to the **Sabbat**, where they would be told they flew there.\n\nThe Haitian satanic Vodoun cult, which has been manipulated by the **CIA/Illuminati,** has sorcerers called bokors. The Vodoun cult in Haiti is being used for trauma-based mind control. One of the items of the cult is to take the plant **Datura stramonium** and add this plant with other things. The plant is the active ingredient of a potent psychoactive drug, the “zombi cucumber” which produces amnesia and a pseudo-death of the victim. The brain doesn’t die, but the mind is shut off.\n\nThe victim is brought back to life as a zombie--a slave of the bokor. The powder to create a zombi is called zombificant in French-creole. The ceremonies to kill and resurrect the zombie are full of magic and demonology also.\n\nMagic, drugs and demonology have always gone hand in hand. Drugs remove the part of the will that prevents demonic possession. Drugs are considered powerful demonizing substances by the those skilled in Demonology. If demonic possession is seen as part of mind-control, then cocaine, hashish, crack, and some of the other drugs are part of the effort to enslave people. (The power of magic to kill, just as the power of faith can heal, will be discussed in chapter 10.)\n\nIn Basutoland in **Drakersbergs**, the Zulu witchdoctors use drugs and trauma to create tokoloshes (mind-controlled zombie slaves). It is said that in recent years, they are using less children and more baboons and monkeys to get tokoloshes. The point is that drugs have been and continue to be used by the occult world for controlling people.\n\nThe intelligence agencies working through the U.S. government financed drug research. An example is that Dr. **Beecher** of Harvard University was given via the U.S. Army Surgeon General’s Office $150,000 to investigate “the development and application of drugs which will aid in the establishment of psychological control.”\n\nResearch into drugs for mind-control began in 1947 at Bethesada Naval Hospital in Maryland. A CIA report described this research as to “isolate and synthesize pure drugs for use in effecting psychological entry and control of the individual.” At the California Medical Facility at Vacaville, Dr. Arthur Nugent, conducted research into drugs for mind control under the auspices of the CIA. The Bureau of Narcotics worked with the CIA to establish “safe houses” where drugs which were seized were given to victims. Some other hospitals which began working with the intelligence agencies with dispensing drugs for mind control include Mount Sinai Hospital, Boston Psychopathic Hospital, University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Valley Forge General Hospital, Detroit Psychopathic Clinic, Mayo Clinic, the National Institute of Health, and Letterman Hospital in the Presideo, CA.\n\nThe military did drug research/programming at the Army Chemical School in Ft. McClellan, AL and at the Edgewood Chemical Center. In 1958, Dr. **Louis Gottschalk**, working for the **CIA** suggested that addictive drugs be used to control people. Some GIs who became addicted to pain killing drugs were subsequently blackmailed by withholding the painkillers until they complied with the demands asked of them.\n\n**Cocaine** has been frequently given to Monarch slaves to get them addicted and give their handlers more control over them. There is spray cocaine, and powdered cocaine, etc. Because the Monarch slaves are used to haul drugs and to launder the drug money, they are right in the middle of large supplies of drugs. If you hear the expression “The snow is falling” it is the Network’s lingo for cocaine.\n\nCocaine is reported to give people a feeling of power and to act as an aphrodisiac.\n\n**APPLICATIONS FOR DRUGS IN PROGRAMMING**\n\nDrugs are used during programming. Although drugs used to assist programming mean nothing to the common person, they each have a specific purpose within a certain type of programming.\n\nSome specific uses for drugs during programming include:\n\n*   Putting people into trance\n*   Teaching alters to go deeper into trance to escape drug effects\n*   Enhancing the trauma\n*   Eroducing out of body experiences e. creating pain\n*   Creating blood vessels that hurt, a pulsating pain, that runs through the body\n*   Controlling histamine production\n*   Helping create illusions such as no hands, no feet, no face, no head etc.\n*   Teaching alters to stay in position\n*   To assist other programming modalities, such as high tech harmonic machines, which implant thoughts. (The machines are used in conjunction with designer drugs.)\n*   Hormones, for instance GnRH, which regulates the physiology of the sexual growth, and is given to speed up sexual growth. Other body developments may also be manipulated.\n*   To enhance or reduce memory\n*   To build the image of the programmer’s power\n\nAt this point, it is appropriate to point out that the personalities of a multiple do not respond uniformly to the same dose of the same drug. Understanding how a drug will effect particular alters is a science in itself. If an alter is holding the body, it will receive more of the effect of a drug. Let’s say Paraldehyde is given to a multiple.\n\nA possible reaction would be that some alters will feel no effect, some will be sedated to a drunken stupor, and child alters may be unconscious or hyperactive. Chloral hydrate might put some alters to sleep while others remain wide awake. Sometimes the personality holding the body may fight the influence of a drug to keep the body.\n\nProchlorperazine is sometimes given by therapists to help alters cope with nausea and vomiting. Most alters will be programmed not to accept drugs except from their master. Lithium suppresses alter switching in some systems. An alter to “protect” the system from the therapist’s helpful medications may develop “allergic” responses. Alcohol is a drug. The reaction of an alter System to it will again be varied. Child alters may become unconscious, while the adult alters don’t even become inebriated by large quantities of hard liquor.\n\nWithin males, dangerous violent personalities may take the body. Within the medical world, often an approximate correct dosage will work. However, with the programming the doses must be extremely fine tuned. Some of the best skilled medical doctors and assistants help with the programming. The Illuminati will initially give the small child a small dose of a drug. They will chart its effect, give it a urinalysis to see how long it stays in the body etc. This is just the testing stage, they are not doing any programming. A number of drugs will be tested, but only one at a time. They clear a child’s body of a drug before they give it another one. They prefer not to mix meds. They will start small to insure they don’t overdose and then increase the dosage until they notice the correct behavior pattern. This will be charted in detail on the slave’s chart.\n\nEach child’s body chemistry is different, so the suggested dosages are only ball park figures which are not precise enough. If too much of a drug is given, the programmers can easily turn a child into a psychotic basket case.\n\nOne of the secrets of the Illuminati/Intelligence agencies is that they have **secret antidotes** for most medications, which, if they have to give them to a child, then they will. They will use an antidote, for instance, to keep a child from going into heart failure. The Programmers will have some helpful drugs and herbs on stock too. It is reported that Glutamic Acid (1000 mg. 3 times/day) will take care of the intense headaches that alters get from lots of switching.\n\nWitch hazel leaves and comfrey root will help internal bleeding.\n\n **Putting people into trance**\n\nAbout 90% of the population can be placed into the somnambulistic (the deepest) hypnotic trance possible simply by giving them hypnotic drugs. The prior list on pages 47-50 gives over 2 dozen drugs that can be used to assist taking someone in hypnotic trance. Special drugs have been designed which will place someone into a deep trance very quickly.\n\nIf an alter is not being cooperative when they are accessed, they can be locked in place mentally and given a quick shot of a fast-acting hypnotic-inducing drug. One drug which was popular for programming was demerol, which would be administered intravenously (an IV). It takes about 5-7 minutes to take full effect after administration via an I.V.\n\nThe dosage can be administered so that the effect remains until the programming session is over. It may be administered about every half hour if appropriate. Children will receive 1 to 2.2 mg/kg dose. Another drug, a truth serum, also consistently works on people making them totally compliant to any directive. Under Baradanga people will give their bank account numbers and anything else a person might want.\n\nThese type of drugs are almost sufficient in themselves to get compliance out of a person. If one realizes that these drugs are used in conjunction to torture, elaborate systems of lies and deception, trauma-bonds, and all the rest of the sciences of mind-control used in the programming, it is easy to see how they are producing totally compliant human robots.\n\n **Teaching alters to go deeper into trance to escape drug effects and pain**\n\nMuch of the training in this area is based upon the child’s horror and fear toward the all powerful master programmer. When the programmer wants the child’s alters to learn to trance deeper, he will give a drug that the alter doesn’t like. The child’s alter will then be told to go deeper into the mind if they want to escape the effect of the drug.\n\nThis enforces the dissociative state being trained for the alter. The suggestion or story line that is given to the alter is frequently the picture of a train. The child is told that the conductor is at the front of the train, but he must move to the back of the train through the train cars. The child is taught to count cars when they go by as if they were steps in the mind.\n\nThis is training the child to descend into deeper levels of the subconscious. The train illustration has been used by programmers when they want the child to remember the drug experience. The programmer wants this experience remembered--at least for a while because it helps increase the child’s fear.\n\nIf the programmer wants the child to forget the drug experience while learning trance depths, then the imagery of a plane taking off and disappearing in the clouds works.\n\n **Enhancing the trauma**\n\nDrugs will be used to enhance the spinning effect when the mind is being programmed to have vortexes and to set up traps within the slave’s mind. One particular drug enhances the trauma by 100 times.\n\nDrugs can be useful for instance, to enhance a child’s terror of the experience of this child being placed in a small box in the fetal position for 24 hours. This helps shorten the programming time, and it also makes the programming more intense. The programmers know what antidotes to give to pull the child out of the enhancement. Marijuana enhances perception of color and noise, but it is not used to enhance trauma.\n\n**The mind does not program well under marijuana. That is why there has been such a big campaign to keep it illegal, even though many studies show it to be safer than alcohol.**\n\n **Producing out of body experiences**\n\nVarious hallucinogenic drugs, **LSD** included, will produce an out of body experience for the victim, if the drugs are administered correctly. The Programmer will prepare the victim with various information and story lines during the administration of the drug. Monarch slaves are being deprogrammed, they may have a memory where their skin feels inflamed and itchy, like a bad mosquito bite.\n\nThe experience may also have the sensation of floating in an unreal world. This may well be an LSD trip given the slave during experimentation and programming. The **CIA** was using LSD beginning in the very early part of the 1950s. Several victims report that some type of potion causes a person to dream while they are awake.\n\nPCP which is “angel dust” is one way to disconnect the cortex from the limbic system and go into an altered state.\n\n **Creating pain**\n\nThis is done with a long list of drugs. Drops of salt water and pepper water are applied to the eyes of victims to make their eyes sting. Another pain in the eye takes place when lights are flashed signalling, “I love you, I love you not.” The child is pulled two ways by this message.\n\nDr. **Green** (Mengele) enjoyed pulling daisy petals while saying these words. If the last petal was “I love you not,” the child would be put to death. Surviving children were left traumatized.\n\n **Creating blood vessels that hurt**\n\nBlood pressure is raised by drugs and then certain drugs are added which make the veins burn. The alter is taught to cut the burning veins. This is programming which is laid in to control the slave from straying from the script he or she is given.\n\nIf they stray, then a cutting program is activated which was laid in via a combination of drugs in the method just stated.\n\n **Controlling histamine production**\n\nThe control of histamine production is an important secret ingredient to the Monarch Mind Control. The breast implants placed into women help stimulate histamine production, which is used in conjunction with drug-assisted programming ([See Chapter 8](https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/mindcontrol/chapter08.htm).)\n\n  **Helping create illusions such as no hands, no feet, no face, no head etc**\n\nA programmer working with a hallucinogenic drug can make an alter believe that it has lost a particular body part. Because most of these alters have little memory or no memory and little frame of reference, what they are told while under the influence of drugs seems very real to them.\n\n  **Teaching alters to stay in position**\n\nSome alters don’t like to stay in position. But through the use of drugs, and the side effect of drugs, they soon learn the importance of staying in position. If they are disobedient, the memory of the bad side effects from not staying in position in the mind can be pulled up by a code and the alter can relive the pain from having disobediently moved from position.\n\nThis is very effective in teaching alters to stay in their little position that is assigned them in the mind.\n\n**To assist other programming modalities**, such as high tech harmonic machines, which implant thoughts. (The machines are used in conjunction with designer drugs.) An example of how drugs can be important is as follows. The neurons in the hippocampus which is part of the memory process use acetylcholine.\n\nDrugs that block acetylcholine interfere with memory. The neurons and the chemical neural transmitters are understood much better today. Where and how a thought is created in the brain is understood by the programmers in detail. No one is in a position to physically prevent **the Illuminati** and others from taking their children and others to labs where chemicals and harmonics can be used in sophisticated computer guided ways to implant thoughts into the children’s minds. As the child’s brain is shaped according to its environment, the level of everyday brain chemicals and the shape of the various areas of the brain can be determined by the programmers.\n\nThis is why a recent article on Prozac (Newsweek, Feb. 7, 1994) uses a quote from *Alice In Wonderland* for its title, “One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small”.\n\nThis article (on page 38) quotes brain researcher **Restak**,\n\n>“For the first time, we will be in a position to design our own brain.” On the previous page in big letters it reads, “Scientific insights into the brain are raising the prospect of made-to-order, off-the-shelf personalities.”\n\nAnother programming modality assisted by drugs is behavior modification. Aversion therapy using a vomit-inducing drug is used on children. Another example of drugs helping assist programming is to give someone LSD and then interview the child while it is hallucinating.\n\nThe hallucinations are then used as programming building blocks by using hypnotic techniques. One way to build on a LSD trip is to tell the child if they ever do a particular thing (such as touch programming, remember programming, and integrate parts, etc.) the victim is to go crazy and hallucinate like they are presently doing. This means that they will be locked up in a crazy house for the rest of their life.\n\nRather than be put in straight-jackets with other crazy people it would be better for the person to commit suicide. By constantly reinforcing this message, some alters will adopt the script “that they are doing the body good to kill it if any alter personality touches the programming,” because otherwise the body will be locked up in a crazy house.\n\nDrugs are used in programming to establish a pattern or a script. There must be a pattern of dissociation. Parts can’t just dissociate into nothing, otherwise there would be nothing to build on. Drugs will play a major role in the structuring of the alter system, which is covered in chapter 7.\n\nThe child doesn’t know where the effect of the drug is coming from. The programmer will take credit for the power of the drug. Whoever administers the drug has power in the child’s mind. The mind wants to be safe. I am familiar with a recent example here in Oregon of someone who escaped from being sacrificed at a Satanic Ritual.\n\nThe legal system told the woman she was crazy when she reported to the police that she had escaped from a Satanic Ritual where they were going to sacrifice her. To control her, the judge ordered 3 types of antipsychotics, twice the normal dose of two kinds of lithium carbonate to put her into a lethargic stupor, Paxil as an antidepressant, and Benztropine mesylate as an antiparkinsonian agent. The antipsychotics were Thiothixene, Thioridazine hydrochloride, and Perphenazine which are all addictive.\n\nThis woman may or may not be a multiple. But this clearly shows the type of mental control via drugs that could be slapped onto someone who dares report Satanic activity to an establishment which has been sadly corrupted from top to bottom. One victim of government mind control tried to get free. The first psychiatrist the person tried to go to was cooperating with U.S. Intelligence and gave her Stelazine, which aggravated the victim’s situation.\n\nWhen the victim spied a general’s uniform in the closet of this psychiatrist, she got another psychiatrist, who unfortunately turned out to be **an ex-DoD employee.** He placed her on Haldol Decanoate, Klonopin, and Benzatropine. The combined effect of these drugs is to erase memory, and create a dissociative disorder.\n\nAll of the drugs were highly addicted. Another fleeing victim was given Trazodone by a physician who was cooperating with the Intelligence agencies. This almost gave the victim a heart attack because it aggravated her heart condition. And yet another escaping victim apparently also fell prey to dirty CIA doctors who were practicing in public without warning people of their intelligence connections.\n\nThis victim was given a combination of Compazine and Xanax, in dosages that the *Physicians Desk Reference* warns against. The doctor, who prescribed this, worked out of an office named after an **MK Ultra programmer.** There are other important things to mention about when drugs are used in Monarch programming.\n\nSome of the cautions that the programmers are alert to include:\n\n>**a.** watching the heart so that it doesn’t stop. Many of the children who have been programmed have died from heart failure. The programmers are very careful to have heart monitors on the victim, and to have paddles ready to revive the body. Because so much of their drugging affects the heart, they accept that they will lose a few to heart failure.  \n   \n**b.** making sure that drugs aren’t given to children who are allergic to them. The programmers take the time to insure that they have the family histories of allergies to drugs, and they will test the children too, before proceeding with drugs. They not only learn the family & individual responses to drugs, but they can test during programming to determine a drug’s blood level in a child. For instance, pentobarbital at a blood level of *5* mcg/ml aids hypnosis, at 15 makes the victim comatose with reflexes, and at 30 makes the person comatose w/ extreme difficulty in breathing. In everyday life, 30 mcg/ml would kill the child. Pentobarbital blood levels can be tested by an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique. For longer-acting Phenobarbital gas chromatography is used. TCA’s are tested by radioimmunoassay, high-perf. liquid chromatography & thin layer chromatography. Some hypnotics are tested by colorimetry, photometry, & spectrophotometry.  \n   \n**c.** switching to herbs when the body is saturated with drugs. When the child’s body has had all the manufactured drugs it can absorb, the programmers switch to a vast collection of natural herbs.  \n   \n**d.** providing the antidote for AIDS. Monarch slaves are routinely given the **antidote for AIDS** and have been since the 1960s-1970s.  \n   \n**e.** knowing how much of a drug each part can take, small young alters can’t take as much. Multiples within a single system have varying levels of tolerance toward drugs. A small child alter may be killed by an adult dosage, even though the age of the body is that of an adult. The programmers are acutely aware of how to deal with multiple personalities.  \n   \n**f.** providing salt to balance the electrolytes in the mind of a programmed multiple personality. An electrolyte imbalance can cause a multiple personality’s mind to go wacky and start spinning. The Multiple could possibly go into shock and die. The programmers are very experienced in understanding the unique requirements of a multiple personality.  \n   \n**g.** An important plant extract for watching brain wave activity is the large plant enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP).\n\nPerhaps it would be worthwhile to briefly mention that all the major chemical and drug companies are run by the Illuminati.\n\nIt would take a book to explain who controls what and how they connect in, and this author could write it. Instead, we will try to give a quick over view. Rather than cover 2 dozen large drug companies, three major drug companies have been randomly selected to show a quick view of how all the drug companies are deeply involved with **Monarch mind-control programming.**\n\nSince the purpose of this book is to show how the mind control is done--this sample of names is given only to convey to the reader that the drugs that the **Illuminati/Intelligence agencies** need are never in short supply.\n\nAnd the labs to develop designer drugs for mind-control are not in short supply either.\n\n* **ELI LILLY CO**. -- Trustee of Eli Lilly Endowment **Walter William Wilson** \\- Illuminati, married to Helen Scudder (of the wealthy powerful Scudder family), prominent partner of Morgan, Stanley & Co. controlled by Henry Morgan also a member of the Illuminati.

    "body": "I have been doing keto for about a month now with some slip ups, but I have to say that after getting over that first bump, I feel so good (physically) that my cravings just aren't worth how badly eating sugary/carby foods feels. The one thing is that I love to cook, and while there are plenty of delicious keto-friendly foods out there, it is also hard to train myself to \"ruin\" my favorite recipes. Unfortunately, most of the delicious Eastern-European food I grew up with are not things I can eat anymore (with some exceptions). French, Italian/mediterranean, Indian, and Ethiopian foods translate really well to keto. I am also pretty sure that my boyfriend would never eat vegetables if I didn't make them for him, so I try to make foods that he will enjoy as well. So here are some recipes that I have found, created, or modified that I think are excellent:\n\nRoasted endives with walnut vinaigrette:\nA variation on this recipe— http://food52.com/recipes/24351-roasted-endive-with-walnut-vinaigrette\n\nI roast the endives with salt, pepper, and walnut oil and like to use balsamic instead of white wine vinegar for the dressing. I don't add the sugar (obviously), and sometimes I replace the mustard with fresh rosemary and thyme to change up the dressing. I also like to sprinkle a little gorgonzola on the endives before I roast them if I am feeling adventurous. The roasting process combats the bitterness that raw endive can have and the nuts and oils in the dressing make it heartier than your average salad.\n\n\nFrench style salmon:\nThis is one of my favorite recipes ever from before keto. You broil the salmon in the oven, remove the skin, and top it with a flavorful cream sauce. I coat the fish with salt, pepper, and a thin layer of mayonnaise, which keeps the natural moisture in better than just rubbing the fish with oil. Cooking times on the salmon vary depending on how hot your broiler gets and how much fish you are cooking at a time. You put the fish in the oven (not the broiler) and turn on the light so you can keep an eye on it; with my oven it takes about 10 minutes to cook 1 lb of fish, but others can be as fast as 3. You want to salmon to be a tiny bit undercooked when you remove it from the broiler because it will keep cooking after you take it out. I like to use sockeye and steelhead trout for the most part.\n\nthe sauce: so simple! braise the white part of a leek in butter. If you are worried about the leek having too many carbs, you can use garlic and/or herbs like parsley and chervil instead and skip the braising part (just add them to warm butter). Once the leeks are braised, you add heavy cream to the sauce and cook it until it is just thick enough to be more sauce-like that liquid (maybe a minute). If you are adding herbs instead of leeks, add them now and stir until they wilt. Add salt and pepper to taste. Remove the skin from the salmon and pour the sauce over each portion. The last time I made this, I served it with lemony garlicy buttery shaved brussels sprouts and it was awesome.\n\n\nSpaghetti squash pastas!\nSpaghetti squash is my favorite pseudo pasta. I make a bechamel-like sauce from heavy cream, a bit of white wine, an egg yolk (to thicken), and parmesan/mixed cheeses. I have made mac and cheese (baked in a casserole dish with tuna fish and bacon, topped with a combination of pork rinds, almond flour, and parmesan cheese \"breadcrumbs\"—kind of a keto franken-food but tasty). Cream and butter sauces add enough fat that I get full before I even get close to going over my carb limit. This is also very tasty topped with some scallops.\n\n\nStuffed eggplant manicotti:\nThis is another favorite. I cut a large eggplant into strips and roast it with salt and olive oil in the oven (about 15-25 minutes at 400 degrees f) so that they are malleable but not so tender that they are falling apart. I make the filling out of ricotta cheese, egg, and frozen spinach (the ratios make it look something like spanakopita filling). I make my own red sauce from crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, herbs, red pepper flakes, and occasionally anchovies or pancetta. You need to use a lot of sauce to keep the eggplant rolls from sticking/finish cooking, so if you are worried about too many carbs in the tomato, you can use a pesto cream sauce or bechamel instead. Pour your sauce of choice into your baking pan until the bottom is coated. Wrap the filling in the eggplant so they look like little eggplant cannolis. Top the \"manicotti\" with sauce, sprinkle with mozzarella and parmesan or italian blend and cook for about 20 minutes, until the cheese starts to bubble up.\n\n\nKeto-borsch:\nSo the trick here is to focus on the meat and cabbage and use just enough root vegetables to give the soup the right flavor. I like to use a head of celeriac, a combination of fresh cabbage and sauerkraut (should be about 1/3 of the stew), a 1/2-1 lb chuck steak, one onion, 1 large or 2 small beets, and 1 large or 2 small turnips. I flavor with paprika, thyme, and dill. I also just chop everything, cover it with water, bring it to a boil, add a condensed soup stock flavoring, cover and turn down to a simmer, and let it cook for 1-2 hours, until the root vegetables are soft and the meat is tender. Serve with sour cream and fresh dill or parsley.\n\n\nDeep fried veggies!\nI use sunflower seed oil, which you can get for pretty cheap at Trader Joe's, and sometimes add a little coconut oil to raise to burning temperature. I made deep friend celeriac strips a week or so ago and they were a delicious (albeit a little soggy). I also made a variation on this delicious recipe for Hannukah: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Carciofi-alla-Giudea-232077\nNot really the time of year for getting fresh artichokes, so I opted for the frozen artichoke hearts from Trader Joe's, which are unfortunately quartered and make for less nice presentation but nevertheless opened beautifully into flowers and tasted delicious. I cooked then in sunflower oil as well. I served both deep fried veggies with garlic aioli sauce.\n\n\nUnsweetened Cassoli (ricotta cakes/pancakes):\nAnother Jewish-Italian recipe, made without sugar. You can look up a few recipes to get the gist of it—some bake in the oven, some are pan fried, some are mostly flour, others have none at all. It's super simple—mostly ricotta, one or two eggs, a tablespoon or so of almond or coconut flour, vanilla, and a dash of sweetener if that's your deal. You put the ingredients in a food processor until they are smooth and look like a batter. Then you fry them like pancakes. I served mine with whipped cream (sweetened with monk fruit powder and cinnamon) and blackberries. You could also use more sugar-like sweeteners or other berries (I bet raspberries would be delicious, but blackberries have been on sale at my grocery store for a while).\n\n\n\nI will try to take some pictures and pay more mind to measurements as I continue my Julia Child of keto journey. More to come!",

    "body": "Here's a review that no one really asked for but is going to get anyways. AYLM isn't a very popular brand around here, I think other than /u/cadinsor 's love for the soap, my enjoyment and maybe a few others it's often overlooked for various and solid reasons. \n\n[Recently ALYM came out with a hard soap](https://abbateylamantia.it/en/shop/hard-shaving-soap/), a stark contrast to their soft Italian croap that we're use to. The intended purpose of this soap is to be a travel soap, it says it right on the lid and it's also 2.82oz but I was most intrigued with the new base than anything else, well the scent was interesting too but I'll get to that later.\n\n**Ingredients** \n\nHere is what AYLM lists as the ingredients for their hard soap: \n\n> INCI AYLM Hard Formula: Sodium Palmate*, Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Aqua, Sodium Palm Kernelate*, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Stearate, Glycerin, Parfum**, Menthol, Persea Gratissima, Glycerin*, Palm Kernel Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter , Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Pentasodium Pentetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Crocus Sativus Stigma Extract*, CI 77891. \n\nThis does lead to a much harder soap than their normal offerings, the puck isn't rock solid it's soft enough you can squish if you press a bit you cannot scoop it like a cream. \n\n**Packaging**\n\nThis isn't a factor for most but I like to bring it up and AYLM always has top notch packaging. The tin comes in a box with label and ingredients, inside the box is the tin with a nice label and info, inside the tin is the wrapped puck left loose. It's great packaging if you're worried about plastic usages. \n\nThe tin is a little small but I had no issues loading a massive 28mm brush but remember it's a travel soap. \n\n**Loading & Lathering** \n\nLike majority of Italian soaps I loaded this with a shaken out brush as Italian soaps if you go in with a damp brush you get a lot of foamy mess, so unless you want to do the Marco method and use 1/10th of your soap do that. But shaken out brush the soap loads easy, lots of suds but it loads quick and easy.\n\nLathering was also very easy just get it on the face and do you thing. The lather itself I found to be denser and creamier than their standard base. To me it's kinda like Catie's Bubbles but a bit denser than that if it makes sense to anyone. It handles water very well, nice and glossy lather it definitely works for me. \n\nThere is menthol in this and it's nothing strong I'd say 4.5-5 on coldness depending on your sensitivity. It's definitely not painfully strong but it's present and cooling, a very enjoyable level of cooling I'd say. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nThis is what was the other main draw for me, the scent is nothing crazy they just listed it as a blue tobacco with menthol, sounds good to me. The scents are tobacco, eucalyptus and menthol. When I first got it I mainly smelled eucalyptus basically like a Proraso Green but now that I've used it a bit more it's a bit more powdery from the tobacco but still get a good amount of the eucalyptus and menthol but I enjoy it. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI always liked ALYM bases for their slickness, it was always great for straights and I've never had an issues with the performance of this soap. This base doesn't fall short of my expectations, maybe even a bit better honestly just for how much more water this could take vs their standard base. \n\nIn the shaves I've had with this I had a few days of growth and easily took off the bulk of hair in the first pass leaving me with a very close and comfortable shave. \n\n**Post Shave**\n\nNow this won't be a powerhouse like a lot of artisan soaps but I guess it's the saffron extract they use and this has a few extra butters but my face just felt smooth and comfortable. Wasn't overly soft or sticky/tacky like some artisan soaps, used a pretty simple splash and felt no needed for a balm and I was quite pleased. This kinda base and feel is great for me in the summer time but winter it may be a bit lacking just with how dry my skin is then, right now it's plenty hydrated. \n\n**The Price**\n\nI cannot avoid this but lets be quick, it's 21€, $24USD or $29CAD. That's up there for 2.82oz  for sure and you can get a lot more for less but I've also spent just as much for soaps I haven't enjoyed. If you like it money well spent, if you don't money wasted. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI enjoy this soap, it works for me in the warmer months, I like it for straights so for me I'll enjoy this tub. I'm sure there are others who would enjoy this too and others who will think it's lacking in a lot of areas. If you're a fan of Italian soaps or similar European soaps give this a try, if you're all in on US artisans and how their bases are now I'd maybe avoid it and buy something you like. \n\n**Disclaimer: I bought this with my own funds, I wasn't asked for a reviews or compensated for writing said review**",

    "body": "RFK Jr, Joe Rogan and other powerful voices have launched a crusade against the oils, saying they’re terrible for you. But nutrition experts disagree\nAimee Levitt\nTue 21 Jan 2025 07.00 EST\n\nt’s January, season of resolutions and virtue, when Americans collectively decide to throw out the butter and sugar and booze and embrace grain bowls and bone broth. Most of these resolutions – 80%, according to some studies – will fade by February, Super Bowl Sunday at the latest, so advertisers pushing dietary health trends have to strike fast.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, the salad chain Sweetgreen unveiled a new January menu that is completely free of “seed oils”.\n\n“Our country is having a long-overdue conversation about food,” Jonathan Neman, Sweetgreen’s co-founder and CEO, announced in a post on X. “And it’s about time. From ultra-processed ingredients to artificial additives, there’s a lot on our plates that isn’t doing us any favors.”\n\nNeman is wrong. Our country is always having a conversation about food. In particular, which food that we’ve always eaten has suddenly become “bad” for us.\n\nThe latest culprits are seed oils, liquid fats extracted from vegetables that are used in cooking. The anti-seed-oil conversation began seven or eight years ago in the corners of the internet where legitimate concerns about diet and nutrition mix with dubious health claims. Eater has traced it to 2017, when an ophthalmologist named Chris Knobbe published a paper arguing that vegetable oils, along with white flour and sugar, are the primary cause of macular degeneration, a chronic and incurable eye disease that’s the leading cause of blindness in the US.\n\nKnobbe subsequently went further and concluded that these foods contributed to all “diseases of civilization”, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer and stroke, and recommended a return to “ancestral foods”, primarily meat and fish.\n\nGradually, the conversation was taken up by “heterodox” influencers who like to say they’re “just asking questions” about government policies such as mandatory vaccines. In 2020, the podcaster Joe Rogan chatted for three hours with Paul Saladino, a physician and proponent of the carnivore diet, who told Rogan and his approximately 15 million listeners that “there’s a direct correlation between incorporating these processed seed oils and terrible health results”.\n\nRogan quickly took up the cause himself. “Your body doesn’t know what the fuck to do with canola oil,” he declared. “Not only is it terrible for you, there’s evidence that it makes you hungrier.” Rogan has switched to animal fats, such as bacon and beef tallow, which he claims are more “natural”. Another physician, Cate Shanahan, collectively dubbed canola, corn, cottonseed, soybean, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed and rice bran oils the “Hateful Eight”.\n\nEnter Sweetgreen, the largest salad chain in the US, which could have chosen to emphasize that they were switching to avocado and extra virgin olive oil in their new menu (and 10 years ago they might have – when those oils’ health benefits were being regularly touted). But by focusing on having “no seed oils” in the marketing, they’re giving red meat (or beef tallow) to the likes of Rogan and Saladino.\n\nIt didn’t matter that the FDA, the American Heart Association and most other medical associations had said that seed oils were not only OK, but healthier than solid animal fats, which have been proven to lead to high cholesterol, insulin resistance and inflammation.\n\n“Influencers have become incredibly powerful,” says Matt Jordan, a professor and critical media scholar at Penn State. “ They’ve displaced institutional expertise that people used to rely on.”\n\nThis past fall, the anti-seed-oil crusade became politicized when it was taken up by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the former presidential candidate turned health secretary pick in the Trump administration. Kennedy told his social media followers that Americans had been “unknowingly poisoned by heavily subsidized seed oils” and he has promised to ban them if he takes office. (The incoming vice-president, JD Vance, has said he doesn’t cook with seed oils, either.)\n\nApps and websites like Seed Oil Scout and LocalFats alert users to which restaurants in their areas have stopped using seed oils and sometimes even take vigilante action: last fall, Seed Oil Scout put up signs around Manhattan claiming that the restaurant Carbone used seed oils in its spicy rigatoni.\n\nSweetgreen has been moving in this direction on seed oils for a while. Influencers, including Saladino, had criticized it for continuing to use seed oil. In the fall of 2023, the chain announced that it would stop cooking ingredients in sesame and sunflower seed oil and use avocado and olive oil instead – though, as Seed Oil Scout pointed out, it still used seed oils in some of its dressings. (Those dressings are still available, but they aren’t part of the new January menu.)\n\n“There’s all these voices online on social media that have really started to focus on the specifics around oils,” Sweetgreen’s co-founder and chief concept officer Nicolas Jammet told Bloomberg at the time. “And so … and this was the investment we wanted to make.” Jammet added that the decision wasn’t based entirely on social media discourse, but also on the supply chain and “what direction we want to shift the industry in”. He did not mention nutrition.\n\nSweetgreen paid influencers to hype the new menu on TikTok. Meanwhile, the seed oil debate continues on the chain’s social media accounts. “WHY are you playing into misinformation and BS about seed oils?” one user complained on Instagram. Sweetgreen did not respond, but other users did: “whats wrong with using olive oil that we have used for thousands of years over cheap engine lubricant”.\n\nThis echoes the major arguments put forth by anti-seed oil influencers: that through the manufacturing process, they are “they’re bleached, deodorized, and loaded with chemicals” and transformed into a “biological poison” that’s responsible not just for the American obesity crisis but afflictions like the common cold.\n\nA heap of flaxseeds beside a dish of flaxseed oil\nRobert F Kennedy Jr claims seed oils are ‘poisoning’ us. Here’s why he’s wrong\nRead more\n“These are well-intentioned but misplaced concerns,” says Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. “They’re bringing together unrelated threads. Each has some partial truths, but when put together, they lead to this mistaken conclusion.”\n\n\nThe manufacturing process does use chemicals and contaminants, Mozaffarian says, but at very low levels, not enough to be harmful. What the processing does is remove compounds that can cause the oil to splatter or smoke or go rancid. The result is a shelf-stable, flavorless oil that can be used to cook food at high heat.\n\nAnother problem with seed oils, according to their critics, is that they are full of omega-6 fatty acids, which cause inflammation. (Red meat, a key component of the carnivore diet, is also high in omega-6 fatty acids.) Inflammation is the body’s response to disease, says Eric Decker, a professor of food science of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and it’s happening at all times, though there’s no evidence that the omega-6 fatty acids make it worse. There is, however, evidence that omega-6s lower LDL cholesterol, and most doctors and scientists agree that this is a good thing.\n\nOpponents of seed oils argue that omega-6s are high in linoleic acid, which, if consumed in large quantities, can lead to obesity, diabetes and possibly cancer. Studies have also shown that levels of linoleic acid have doubled in American adults in the past 50 years. Kennedy claims that this change began when McDonald’s stopped cooking fries in beef tallow and switched to vegetable oil (“It’s time to Make Frying Oil Tallow Again,” he posted on X). But, scientists point out, American consumption of deep fried fast food and sugar-filled processed snacks have also increased over the past half-century. As always, correlation is not causation.\n\nThe alternative to omega-6 fatty acids is omega-3 fatty acids, found in olive oil. Omega-3 fatty acids contain antioxidants and are anti-inflammatory, says Decker. “There’s lots of good clinical data that shows that this is the best fat to consume. The problem with it is it’s expensive, at least three times the price of a seed oil.”\n\nDecker suggests that the best solution is to use both olive and seed oils. “I would always say to people, ‘You know, you should eat an omega,’” he jokes. Mozaffarian agrees that the omegas are “both good for us. We need more of them, and we’re underconsuming both of them.” And both kinds of oils are definitely healthier than solid animal fats like tallow, butter and lard, which contain saturated fats that raise cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease.\n\nIf it’s truly the case that seed oils aren’t terrible for us, that the science actually supports it, why is there all this hatred?\n\nNutrition can be “very confusing”, says Decker, adding that there are too many voices out there giving out contradictory information. “The end result is that people stop listening, which is too bad.”",

I am currently living in Japan and have very little access to curly hair care without having to ship stuff (which is quite expensive and not always possible). I cant even find coconut oil. I have found a Japanese conditioner which is all organic and doesn't seem to have anything bad in it but my hair is not responding AT ALL. I ordered some marshmallow root to help with slip but my hair is very dry and hard and frizzy and tangled and unhappy. So I am unhappy.\n\nI wash my hair twice a week. I put some conditioner in it and massage my scalp and cold rinse. I then use conditioner to detangle. After detangling I put a mixture of olive oil and honey on my hair with some Marc Anthony Curl cream (which I have to import and has evil ingredients too)\n\nIt takes over an hour to detangle (with my fingers). I want to know what I am doing so wrong so that I can keep on looking for a conditioner that works or some extra ingredients to import to mix with my current conditioner. I used to use Tressame Moisture Rich (which is also not available in Japan) but I noticed it had dimethicone in it so I stopped but my curls felt and looked soo much happier back then. I am so frustrated. \n\nThe conditioner I am using now has many emolients in the ingredients and not so many moisturizing components but I dont know what to add.\n\nTop 15 ingredients are: water, Behenyl\tSynthetic (rapeseed, etc.), \nBehenyl PG trimonium chloride, Alga near spinosa kernel oil, Macadamia nut oil, Damask rose flower oil, Atlas Cedar bark oil, Lavender oil, Jojoba seed oil, Olive oil, Broccoli seed oil, Almond oil, Rose hip oil, Sunflower seed oil \n\nThe website with detailed ingredients is below, google translate works very well (I am sorry):\nhttp://www.matsukiyo.co.jp/mkc/argelan/products/argan_treatment.html\n\nI washed my hair this morning.

Are you using the ancient clay or the macadamia conditioner? I use the ancient clay stuff 1-2 times a week with the pink clay mask once a week after shampooing with the seaweed mineral gel. S2C comes out feeling a bit sticky on second day and third day curls, but I think I just haven't found the right amount of conditioner for it yet. I did condition a bit more often when I started using it, probably closer to every other day.\n\nSo far, this is the best stuff I've found for curly hair in the country in the 10 years I've been here. I used to use the Je L'Aime Amino line in the pink bottles, but the conditioner and deep conditioner still had silicones and made the back of my head crispy. The other brand I liked that I haven't seen in Hiroshima is RinRen: http://www.bxe.co.jp/rinren/en/ Silicone free and I do believe SLS free even though they don't advertise it. I used to find it at Sugi Pharmacy when I lived in Gifu, so if you have any of those around you try looking for it there.\n\nI don't personally use coconut oil, but I have seen it more often in higher-end grocery stores lately. I have no idea if that's even usable on hair, to be honest. Most AEON and YouMe Town shopping malls should have a Kaldi shop in them, which usually sells coconut oil among its import baking items.\n\nIf you haven't tried it yet, iherb.com is a great site for hair care items. I order my Kinky Curly Styling Custard through them, along with multivitamins and melatonin to qualify for free shipping. If you haven't tried iHerb yet and are interested, lemme know.

    "body": "Hello! Good morning, & how do you all do?\n\nToday I am going to be delving into skincare! In particular, the indie skincare brand, **Chikyu**. You can find the storefront on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Chikyu?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=572367388) as well as a personal business [website](https://chikyuskincare.com/). For thorough information about each ingredient & benefits please check the site listings. I haven’t even made a dent in the items I want to try from the catalog, but I feel as if I have acquired enough product (purchasing & through generous samples) that it was time to do reviews. Be prepared for a rave fest! Also I might break this up in different posts, to keep it from being a slog of reading.\n\nTAT was incredibly swift. The packaging is *the most* thoughtfully packaged item I have ordered from a skincare company. Everything was wrapped so delicately in tissue paper & securely, all secured with a beautiful knotted silky type rope. I have ordered three times now, & there has been a generous amount of sizable samples included each time! Before I even get into the quality of the product itself, I have to mention the quality of the containers & labeling. Absolutely as if you were ordering from a high end, big brand, but in my humble opinion, better than that! \n\nAbout my skincare, if it is of any use. As I have gotten older, my skin requirements have started to change, & I now consider myself in the mature skin category. I can get a mild breakout from time to time if I am on my cycle & irritate my skin at the same time, but it is not as sensitive as it was in my twenties. I do require products that are heavier in terms of moisturizing, & probably have for a while now without realizing it. My main issues are sebaceous filaments, milia on my cheeks, hyperpigmentation, & dry patches. Wrinkles I don’t see as an issue, just a part of aging, although I do want to be proactive at not accelerating them any quicker than need be.\n\nNow let the reviewing commence!!\n\n# Utsukushii “INDIGO Elixir” – Fortifying Night Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nIngredients: Rice Bran Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, Olive Squalane, Papaya Oil, Shiso-Yo (Japanese Perilla Oil), \\*White Chia Oil,\\*Coconut Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, , Blue Tansy, Jasminum Sambac, Vitamin E, Poris Cocos Mushroom, Marine Algae, Rice Ferment Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Pseudocollagen,\n\nAlright folks. This is *the* product that drew me into this brand in the first place. I had been searching for some time, for a blue tansy face serum or a balm. After some deliberation & searching this subreddit for past reviews, I actually found a raving review on this exact product & with communication from the OP I was confident in going in on a FS.\n\nAs you will find out with a lot of the products, this one is a staple in my routine now. The FS comes in a beautiful, quality glass dropper style bottle. The serum goes a long way, & while it feels very moisturizing, it is lightweight & sinks into the skin fairly quickly. The smell is slightly earthy, which I enjoy. It has a very soothing quality & it does not just sit on top of the face. I was worried about the coconut oil, but I am almost done with my first FS bottle (heavy handed use) & I have not had any adverse reactions to it. I do find that my hair tends to absorb the oils at night, but actually I feel as if it has been helping my dry hair so win/win! I apply this only at night, right after a bukachoil serum from another store. I recommend trying sample sizes or a trial size before committing to a FS though, because I did find I have a preference between three of the serums I have tried.\n\n# Indigo (Silk) Face Cream\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n30ml/1oz (Full Size)\n\n7.4ml/.25oz (Trial/Miniature Size)\n\n1.5ml (Sample Size/Skin Tester)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\*Calendula Hydrosol, Marula Oil, Prickly Pear Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, \\*Calendula Oil, \\*Rose Hip Oil, \\*Aloe Leaf, \\*Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Jojoba Oil, Witch Hazel, Sunflower Seed Oil, \\*White Willow Bark, \\*Neem Oil, Pseudocollagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyto Peptide Complex (Plant Based Peptides), Silk Amino Peptides, Blue Tansy (Moroccan Chamomile ESO), Klamath Blue Algae, Caprylic Triglyceride (Coconut based), Stearic Acid (Plant Sourced), Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Palmarosa Oil, May Chang fruit oil, Benzoin Resin oil, Cedarwood Bark Oil. Magnesium, NonGMO Soybean Germ Extract.\\*Rosemary ESO, Vitamin E, \\*Vegetable Glycerin, Radish Root ESO\n\nI had originally received this as a sample in my first order & ended up ordering a FS. I usually use a different brand of face moisturizer that I honestly prefer over this one. Although for reasons unknown to me, the shop never followed through with shipping out of my order & even though there were communications with the other shop owner, I still don’t know if I am getting my package or a refund as informed. Either way, with that in mind, I ordered a FS of this because as a replacement, this one fits the bill nicely & Chikyu is always extremely reliable. It doesn’t feel as moisturizing as my preferred, but it also doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry by any means. It isn’t greasy & absorbs fairly quickly. The size is in my opinion slightly smaller than I had imagined, but a little really does go a long way, especially if you are also using her other products. The container is quality glass like her other FS products. I think the price is reasonable though, because this one is packed full of vastly more beneficial ingredients comparatively. So I would definitely recommend this to someone who doesn’t like a heavy moisturizer. There is a mushroom moisturizer that I am more interested in trying, so before I finish this container, I will order a sample of that one to see if it is better suited for me. Until then I will continue to use this product.\n\n# Hakumai Mizu “Rice/Pearl” Face Cleanser\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar with Bamboo Fibers)\n\n4oz (Full Size Glass Jar without Bamboo Fibers)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Fermented Rice Water\\*, Coconut Oil\\*, Lavender Flower Extract\\*, Rose Hip Oil, Castor Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Matsutake Mushroom Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple Fruit Essence), Wild Burdock Root Extract\\*, Crushed Pearl Powder, Rice Ferment Peptides, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Bamboo Fibers, \\*Grey Sea Salt, Glucose (Sugar Based), Vitamin C, Vegetable Glycerin\\*, Sake, Stearic Acid (Plant Derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Gum, NataPres (Radish Root, Honeysuckle, Aspen Bark).\n\nI had also originally received a sample of this & ended up FS. I really love this cleanser. The sample does not come with the option for the bamboo fibers, & when I ordered a larger size I opted for the bamboo fibers. This is an extremely sizeable glass container for how little you need to use. It has a pearlescent sheen to it that is extremely beautiful. The bamboo fibers are delicate, but abrasive enough to scrub the skin without having to apply much pressure on your face when rubbing it in. I did notice that using this alone as a cleanser left my skin feeling stripped more than I would like. So with that in mind the next product I will review compliments this one. This is definitely a staple, but I am very curious about her other cleansers & plan on sampling the others to see if I have a preference. I am especially interested in the Matcha Cleanser.\n\n# Facial Cleansing Oil\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\nSize: 4oz (Full Size)\n\n1oz (Trial/Travel Size)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Meadowfoam Oil, \\*Camellia Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Castor Oil, \\*Rose Geranium ESO, Multifruit BSC\n\nI love this cleansing oil. This is admittedly my first foray into double cleansing & boy do I feel like a dingus for not having done this before! In my opinion, if you use the rice/pearl cleanser, this one is a must to use beforehand. I have noticed with consistent use, that my face is left feeling more moisturized & better cleansed than if I had just used the other alone. A little goes a long way, the FS is a glass pump container that is sizeable. No matter what cleanser I use, I will always have this in my routine. The smell is delicate, & does not irritate my skin whatsoever. I highly recommend trying a sample of this product. The sample I originally ordered was enough to carry me through three weeks of heavy handed use. I have no plans on looking for another cleansing oil. I will continue to use this as long as Lyn sells it!\n\n# Kagayakimasu “GLOW” Face Elixir\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: \\*Watermelon Oil, \\*Cucumber Seed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, \\*Olive Oil, \\*Hemp Seed Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, \\*Tsubaki (Camellia) Seed Oil, \\*Jojoba Oil, \\*Tamanu Oil, Wheat Germ Oil,Geranium ESO, Lavender ESO, Grapefruit ESO, Pseudocollagen\n\nThe sample size container reminds me of my previous career in histopathology working with antibodies in immunohistochemistry. It’s a little flip top, sturdy, plastic container, but isn’t flat on the bottom. Something you would have in a rack while you pipette. Alright, I wanted to love this one. It smells absolutely gorgeous! But it felt way too heavy on my face, almost greasy. I am glad I only ordered a sample size of this, because I did start getting some clogged pores & small breakouts on my chin & forehead after using this one. I will mention that I had started my cycle right after trying this one, so that really could have been the culprit, but my face didn’t feel as irritated after I stopped using it. I just don’t feel like this one is for me & that is ok! I believe it is well loved by others here & obviously on her multiple reviews on both store sites. I plan on using up the sample on my décolletage‬ area & hands. \n\n# Liquid Moisture\n\nAvailable Sizes:\n\n1oz (Full Size)\n\n.25ml (Trial Size/Miniature)\n\n1.5ml (Sample)\n\nINGREDIENTS: Cranberry Seed Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Baobab Oil, \\*Pumpkin Seed Oil, \\*Borage Oil, \\*Grapeseed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Neroli ESO, Jasmine Grandiflorum Absolute, Jasmine Flowers, Pseudocollegen\n\nI ordered the trail size of this product & it comes in a cute little glass dropper style bottle. This serum specifically states on the listing that it will not clog pores & is intended for dry skin. I love this one just as much as the Indigo serum. I would say this is the lightest, in terms of weight & oiliness it leaves on the face compared to the other two. It feels as if it sinks in faster than the other two. I do prefer to use a bit more in my hand to get an even layer spread out, but it is perfect for adding it underneath my daily moisturizer. I only wear this one in the morning since it is so lightweight. I plan on purchasing a FS of this on my next order. Although I am curious about the Silk Serum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love everything about Chikyu. From the amazing customer service, the high quality & intention with each creation, the reliability of knowing I will receive my products & that the turn around time is consistently quick, & the fact that is actually making my skin feel better. In regards to my skincare needs, I have seen a significant reduction in the milia I usually have on my cheekbones, my dry patches that I tend to get on the sides of my nose/under eye area are not an issue, & with proper usage of cleansing & adequate moisturizing of my face, my blackhead/sebaceous filaments have become less apparent. I did not realize that I was over-cleansing & under-moisturizing my face before & that was what was making my pores look so raggedy & sad! Also, my hands have been feeling the love & are not scary lizard skin looking like before. They are soft & happy!! I highly, highly recommend at the very least, ordering some samples if you are curious. There is so much to try, that I am positive you will find something that works for you. If you made it this far, thank you for reading my thoughts!! I would absolutely love to hear about anyone else's experience with Chikyu products, especially ones I haven’t mentioned! I do have a lot more product samples I haven’t touched yet, & plan on leaving another review eventually! I tried to be thorough & I hope I didn't leave anything out! Have a nice day!",

Healing was pretty much the theme of the haul that time.\nIt arrived about 3-4 weeks ago and I have been trying it ever since.\n\nTexture; It's an opaque white color. Somewhat like a slightly more watery sunscreen or baulm. If anyone has tried LRP cicaplast, the texture is similar. Smooth texture.\n\n5/5 : Smooth and not too thick, or too watery.\n\nApplication; It's pretty easy to apply since it's not very thick. It's smoothness also helps.\n\n5/5 : Easy to apply\n\nFeel on skin; It sinks in fairly well. Feels a tiny bit oily (likely from the sunflower seed oil which is one of top ingredients). But also has this interesting primer-esque like feel. Perhaps from the silicates or b5 since it has 10%\n\n4.5/5 : feels really nice but I HAVE to remove half a star for slight oilyness/and FA triggers. I am a oily gal so anything with too much oils is overwhelming. Tho this is less oily than LRP cicaplast and their riche cream.\n\nEffect; This stuff is not quite HG to me as I am uncertain about it's healing effect. I'm monitoring it for effect. Only issue is I have to use it seperate to my HG Benton centella gel, which means stopping using that for a while.  It is soothing in the least and moisturising.\n\n?4?/5 : 4 just for moistursing and the soothing, primeresque feel\n\nWould potentially repurchase. Especially if I find it increases healing significantly on it's own.\nIn terms of feel and the other stats it does work really nicely with my Benton centella gel. Though it is a nice stand alone in it's own regards and kind of is a better version than 2 LRP products. Imo.",

    "body": "Source: I was a professional line cook for 3 years at a banquet kitchen where I would make between 15 and 45 gallons of various dressings and vinaigrettes in a *single day.*\n\nOkay, so here's my theory about how Matt is actually wrong about the composition of Pink Sauce. There ABSOLUTELY is without a doubt is a potential binding ingredient listed on the food label for Pink Sauce.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zkz1t9ma4j91.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=b315a24d8b9caf808edb5f54c0ed7158ed1fbd43\n\nDon't understand? \n\nLet me explain:\n\nMatt is right that Pink Sauce *looks* like a creamy sauce, and given that it comes in what appears to be a mayonnaise bottle, I totally understand where he came to that conclusion. However, what I'm proposing is that that Pink Sauce is not actually a creamy dressing but a *vinaigrette.* \n\nIn the culinary world, a vinaigrette is a dressing traditionally made up of 1 part acid to 2-3 parts oil. The acid, which is usually some type of vinegar, is mixed with spices and other ingredient to make the base. Once you have the base, combine the mixture through the process of emulsification.\n\nSee, like Matt showed in the video, oil and vinegar don't naturally mix well together. If you pour them into the same container, they will immediately separate from each other. But by emulsifying the ingredients, meaning adding the oil slowly to the base while continuous blending the mixture together at a high speed preferably using an immersion blender, the vinegar and oil can be effectively bonded into a thick, opaque dressing without the use of \"creamy\" ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xwry01kd4j91.png?width=348&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c7186890ff6d7f6c883844ff9e55dd7c15f1e42\n\nTake this balsamic dressing by [SimplyScratch.com](https://www.simplyscratch.com/house-balsamic-vinaigrette/) for instance. Just like Pink Sauce, despite the \"creamy\" like appearance, no where on the ingredients do you see eggs or mayo listed. The ingredients as listed are Garlic, Balsamic Vinegar, Red Wine Vinegar, Mustard, Dried Basil, Black Pepper and Olive Oil.\n\nAnd the Key Ingredient we need to pay attention to here is Mustard.\n\nBecause Matt is right about one thing. To keep a vinaigrette from slowly separating back into vinegar and oil, you need a binding ingredient. In creamy dressings, this is often eggs or mayo.\n\nThat's not the case for a vinaigrette. The binding ingredient in a vinaigrette is Mustard, and more often than not, *Dried Mustard Powder (*because in its dried form you need to use less per batch than liquid mustard to have the same effect). In this case, mustard actually serves two purpose in a vinaigrette, it creates a more stable shelf life for the product so it doesn't separate AND thickens the mixture to give it a more thick, creamy looking texture.\n\nThe general rule is that the more mustard + the more oil you use in any given recipe means more stability, more thickness, and a more creamy appearance.\n\nSo then the question is, can mustard act as an effective binding ingredient even when it's less than 2% of the total product?\n\nAnd the answer is...yes.\n\nWhen using dried mustard powder, I would say a 1/4 is about the maximum amount of mustard you would want to use per gallon. This is less a scientific measurement and more just based on my years of experience as a line cook. So take it with a grain of salt, but also know that I've also made *hundreds* of gallons of vinaigrette in my life. Any more than 1/4 cup is going to make your dressing excessively thick. \n\nSo then, let's break it down. \n\n1/4 cup = 4 tbsp \n\n1 gallon = 256 tbsp,\n\n4/256 = 0.015625 Or roughly, a little over 1.5% to make a thick, opaque vinaigrette.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, homemade Vinaigrettes have a shelf life of roughly 1-2 weeks before the binding of the mustard starts to break down, which may account for the 'spoiling' that the product experienced when the TikToker tried to ship her product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR In conclusion, with all due respect to our Food Theorist master, I think MatPat was wrong on this one.\n\nPink Sauce is a VINAIGRETTE.\n\nDried Mustard Powder is the BINDING INGREDIENT and its hidden under the category of DRIED SPICES on the food label.\n\nAnd that's my theory...MY FOOD THEORY.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\-\n\nFair disclaimer, this theory does rely on assumption that the fat content on the label is wrong. If my theory is correct, the Sunflower Seed Oil would have to be the ingredient with the highest volume in the recipe, ranking before Vinegar in the order of food ingredients listed on the food label. Which it does, but as Matt noted, that doesn't line up with what the actual nutritional facts are stating.\n\nSecond disclaimer, in my years of a cook, I've never seen a Vinaigrette with water as a primary ingredient. Pink Sauce is runnier than the vinaigrette I've personally made, so my only explanation for that is that she may be using water to thin it out. But still, it doesn't quite add up logically. If water is the ingredient with the highest volume even before oil, like the label implies, I do not know what that would do to the stability of the mixture. It's beyond my guess because I've literally never seen it done before.",

I don't think your theory is wrong but I feel like if it was really a vinaigrette, people wouldn't be claiming it tastes like sweet mayonnaise because it wouldn't. unless you add ranch or mayo, nothing in that ingredients list is going to make that vinaigrette taste like sweet ranch/mayo as people were reporting it did, I'd imagine. idk if you have a high powered food processor to test this in but id love to see what you come out with, if you decide to test your theory.",

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if I'm just not meant to be wearing polish, and what to do from here to fix it. :(\nIt only happens on my fingers, not my toes, so I'm pretty sure it's not an internal cause.\n\nIn January I began wearing polish regularly, with 2-3 days break between each mani. I started out using Essie Here to Stay base coat, but reading from someone else that it messed up their nails, I switched to Essie smooth-e base coat after about a month.\n\nI use CND Solar Oil several times every day (wasn't as good about using it in the beginning), and do a hot oil soak with sunflower seed oil once a week. Unfortunately I can't avoid long water exposure too much, but I try my best. I use a glass file to shorten my nails as well.\n\nI've read to keep polish on to act as a shield, but I don't know if that's the best course of action since the issues only started after polish. Aside from suspecting the polish itself, it might be an issue with my removal process, since I rub the polish off with an acetone remover, I'm not exactly gentle about it.\n\nWhat do I do from here? I can either keep the polish off entirely and just continue with the jojoba oil and keeping my nails filed short until hopefully the issues go away, or I could polish and keep at it with the oil still, but do something different with my removal process. Anyone else had this issue and found a way to fix it?\n\n",

By itself it can exacerbate flaking on damaged nails, so my brand new process is OPI Repair Mode - base coat - top coat - peel base - lacquer - top coat. That's worked pretty well so far! The bottom layer lasts me 2-3 manis. It wipes off easily, so there's no need for a long acetone soak.\n\n- Acetone additive. I didn't believe the hype, but it does actually work! The recipe is one part glycerin to ten parts acetone, then shake real hard. If the glycerin doesn't dissolve, add one part water. Or just buy some if you don't mind it being scented.\n\nI've only done these for a week and a half, but my nails and cuticles already look SO much healthier. I guess there's only so much oil can do!",

Don't buff your nails except maybe right at the tip after you clip and/or file them, just to make them less scratchy.\n\n\n\n2. Don't wear polish while the peeling grows out.\n\n\n3. To remove polish if you do wear it, use 100% cosmetic grade acetone and do more of a soak off strategy instead of scrubbing. Soak cotton ball/pad in acetone, hold on nail for about 2 minutes (there are clips to help with this), and then firmly press down and drag off the nail toward the free edge. This is also a whole lot less messy than rubbing in circles or back & forth to remove the polish, and I think it's faster in the end.\n\n\n\n4. Warm oil soaks with jojoba in between manicures.\n\n\n5. Use a wood stick and cuticle remover to remove cuticles gently, instead of a glass or metal object which makes it easier to accidentally damage some of your nail layers.\n\n\nAny changes you make to your routine may take about 6 months to really yield results, depending on how fast your nail grows out.",

It also helps protect them from soaking up a lot of water when they’re regularly polished. I would also wonder if maybe doing a hot oil soak could be over-hydrating your nails? (I however don’t know anything about oil soaks so that’s just a complete shot in the dark).\n\nWhen I was having some peeling issues it had turned out to be issues with my base coat at the time, but I see you’ve already switched that - were you seeing the weakness/peeling when you were using the previous base coat, or just after you switched to the new one?\n\nSorry that was a lot to say not a lot, hopefully some of it is helpful!",

    "body": "So I took a baby care class at my hospital last night, the instructor was surprisingly crunchy (in a good way) considering the setting.  She said that newborn skin is so sensitive you should only use water to clean it - no wipes - because the preservatives, surfactants and scents could be irritating to the new skin and cause rashes.    \n&nbsp;    \nShe recommended buying a thick non-textured towel-like paper towel like the regular non-textured Viva, using a peri bottle to moisten the paper towel, and using it like a wipe.  She even said you could throw an empty peri bottle in your diaper bag to make these \"wipes\" on the go.     \n&nbsp;    \nDoes this sound too good to be true?  It would work out to $.01 per \"wipe\", without factoring in any coupons or discounts.  It makes complete snese to me - just moisten a strong paper towel.  I'm a FTM and am in disbelief that I've never heard this before - there's gotta be a reason why, right?  Anyone have any thoughts?    \n&nbsp;    \nShe also said the best way to clean dry stuck on poop from baby's bottom is by rubbing some coconut/olive/sunflower seed oil on it with a clean \"wipe\"... these low-comendogenic food grade oils are also better than baby lotions if your baby has some dry skin - rub a few drops in where needed - it's gentler than any lotion out there and if baby licks it it's not a problem.  Maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but as FTM I thought that was a neat idea.     \n&nbsp;    \nAnd while I'm recalling the 3 hour class last night, she also said that a 1:4 vinegar to water solution (stronger for extra dirty items) is a cheap and perfectly acceptable baby safe disinfectant for any and all home and baby related items, that has the bonus feature of eliminating odors. Again, probably obvious, but it blew my FTM mind :)  ",

I'd at the very least use cotton pads rather than paper towel, I think paper towel as wipes would probably make their butt end up like when you have a cold and wipe your nose with tissues too much, i.e. red and tender.\n\nOlive oil on the butt is definitely the best idea, meconium is like trying to clean vegemite off a balloon and a barrier between it and the skin makes it so much easier!  \nWe also added a drop of lavender oil to some olive oil as post-bath massage oil, it makes babys skin beautiful and happy and also smells nice!

Maybe certain oils would help with that?\n\nIf you do try oils, be wary of which ones! Although cocnut is crazy popular, more people are allergic to it than you think.

This Mineral Sunscreen claimed to offer non-Chemical Protection while still having a minimal white-cast.\n\nWhile I suppose it is “minimal”…on my Skin Tone it is still super apparent and not something I can really leave the house in.\n\nThis Product uses Titanium Dioxide as its UVA/UVB Filter. Niacinamide, Hemp Seed Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Turmeric Extract, and Sunflower Seed Oil make the list as well. Honestly, this is a pretty nice “Skincare Forward” Sunscreen Product that I think can offer some benefits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb5kimdmjoo41.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc8085d6737fa3a914b088a478e0e66e810348e\n\nAside from the white-cast…the fresh/clean scent to this Product is a bit strong for my taste.\n\nAnyway, kind of a bummer since I got these as a 1+1 and they are 100 ML each LOL! I have a lot of it and plan on passing it along to someone with a bit fairer than myself or just using it on my arms (it seems to be less white-cast-y on my arms/hands).",

    "body": "Hello! This is my first post and I have been reading a lot of your posts on this subreddit as well as doing constant research because of my own motivation to get rid of my acne completely...I have compiled some useful information for those of you trying to improve your skin care regimen and fight your acne through knowledge. I hope this helps!\n\nFor **oily/combination** skin types out there, you might run away from the idea of using natural oils for your face, but there is evidence that using oils on your face after cleansing can actually *signifcantly decrease oil production* and *reduce acne inflammation* with extended use, by acting as a protective barrier for the face.\n\nOils on your face (natural or not) may cause acne, but lack of oils can also cause acne, so it is important to be conscious of your skin regimen and find the real source to the cause of your acne. (some oils are non-comedogenic)\n\nAfter cleansing, most cleansers will break down most of the oil on your face, thus getting rid of the dirt and particles stuck to the oil. Your oil glands will react to the sudden dryness by producing excessive oil quickly, counteracting to your efforts to reduce the amount of oil on your face. Excessive oil will only cause acne! Using a gentle cleanser may help, but it is also important to give your skin back the oil that it lost (without creating a greasy mess on your face!) Oily skin types can benefit from using specific facial oils as moisturizers, such as emu oil (most similar structure to the oil your skin produces), sunflower seed oil, etc. or face creams that contain a few facial oils (you can try this if you use a gentle cleanser, since the oils on your face are not completely stripped away and you need extra oil.) Make sure to use only a few drops of oil and distribute it evenly on your face!\n\n[Impact of topical oils on the skin barrier](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2002.tb03275.x/abstract)\nThis article shows that **linoleate-rich oils** can strengthen the protective barrier of the skin.\n[\"The impact of oils on mouse epidermal barrier function (rate of transepidermal water loss over time following acute barrier disruption by tape-stripping) and ultrastructure was determined. A single application of sunflower seed oil *significantly accelerated skin barrier recovery within 1 h; the effect was sustained 5 h after application.* In contrast, the other vegetable oils tested (mustard, olive and soybean oils) all significantly delayed recovery of barrier function compared with control- or Aquaphor-treated skin. Twice-daily applications of mustard oil for 7 d resulted in sustained delay of barrier recovery.\"]\n\nAn interesting note:\n[Facial Oils Comedogenecy](https://illumineat.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/comedogenic-and-non-comedogenic-oils/)\n[\"In general, remember that all oils contain fatty acids, and fatty acid has an effect on the comedogenecy level of oils.\n\nFor example, linoleic acid is a great fatty acid for the skin! It does not clog pores and actually helps reduce the inflammation that surrounds clogged pores. Safflower oil (of the high-linoleic acid avriety) is—no surprise—high in linoleic acid. Oleic acid, on the other hand, is likely to cause clogged pores and the topical use of oils with a  high percentage of oleic acid should be avoided, expect by those with dry skin. Olive oil is high in oleic acid.\"]\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/hillary-peterson/face-oils_b_1747283.html\nWhy may creams not be as beneficial?\n[\"Creams are mostly waxes and water, with a few oils thrown in.5 Waxes form an occlusive layer on the skin, which helps to hold moisture in. There are two downsides to waxes: wax build up may lead to clogged pores, and the wax barrier may prevent the oil component of the cream (the part of the product that actually benefits skin) from penetrating. This is likely the reason why creams typically deliver a higher level of diminishing results over time. They will work, at first, because they help to initially hold in moisture, but as time goes on the wax barricade may prevent oils from delivering nutrients, like essential fatty acids, to the skin.\"]\n\n\n**Quick tip: Sometimes oils can be the main cause of closed comedones (small bumps on your face.) If that is the cause, dont shy away from facial oils. Instead, try using a daily exfoliating scrub 2x/week to get rid of the trapped dead skin cells that build up easily, and use a gentle chemical exfoliant (glycolic acid, lactic acid) weekly. Avoid [mineral oil](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/toxic-ingredient/mineral-oil) (derived from petrolatum, toxic) and petrolatum (holds risk of being comedogenic, highly controversial ingredient so I would advise the most sensitive skin types not to touch it) If that doesn't work, it might be caused by bacteria (use a benzoyl peroxide treatment or acne medication) or fungus (the fungus Pityrosparum mimics small acne, try acne medication for this.)\n\nReferences:\nhttps://illumineat.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/don%E2%80%99t-fight-chemistry-how-to-wash-your-face-with-oil-the-oil-cleanse-method-ocm/\n\nhttps://illumineat.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/comedogenic-and-non-comedogenic-oils/ (offers a comedogenity scale for facial oils)\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/hillary-peterson/face-oils_b_1747283.html (provides even more professional references)\n\nhttp://www.details.com/blogs/daily-details/2013/10/why-you-should-be-using-a-face-oileven-on-oily-skin.html",

My SIL bought this from me after telling her my oil cleanser woes. I tried this during my bachelorette trip at Punta Cana because I needed to be able to take off my waterproof sunscreen properly (separate review on that sunscreen because it didn’t break me out either!). To my surprise, I didn’t actually break out during the trip. It could still be weather related since my face seems to LOVE humidity. I will continue to use this daily and monitor, but it’s been great so far. It takes my make up and waterproof sunscreen adequately without causing any breakouts. 100% will repurchase again at an affordable $10 per jar.",

        "body": "All right, this will be my first ever attempt of trying to help someone out on Reddit. Here we go:\n\nLets start out with seasoning the fish. Salt and pepper on both sides and be generous. You lose about 70% of the seasoning when you sauté the salmon. Season fish, meat or any proteins really right before you get it in the pan, this is because salt will dry out the meat when you leave it just to sit there.\n\nPut your pan on a high heat, frying is all about getting the right temperature. You want that skin to be crisp and delicious, scoring the meat beforehand could help that process a little. But don't put your pan too hot, it has no use. I would say 6 is probably enough. \nYou don't put it on maximum because your goal is not to 'sear' the salmon, but to cook it. By the time your salmon done, you will have achieved the same colour on the flesh as you would have with the pan on 10. You're looking for a nice golden brown colour, the fish shouldn't be grey. Colour = Flavour. Also, when you cook salmon with too much heat, you will get little white dots on it, those are egg whites that you don't want to see. Keep the high, but not extremely. \n\nNow put your fat in the pan, in your case; sunflower seed oil. Make sure you don't put too much in, just a good tablespoon should do. \nSalmon with skin will release quite a bit of its own oil into your pan. \nPut the salmon in skin down and leave it. When its nice and crisp flip it and cook the other side. If you think that the flesh side is going to burn, flip it again and just keep cooking it on the skin side. I never use the oven to cook little pieces of salmon like those. I just don't think its needed.\nWhen the salmon is nearly done, add your butter, lemon and base if you want.\n\nNow here is the tricky part:\nMost people overcook their salmon because they don't know it still looks a bit rare while it's fully cooked. \nLook at 2:10 in this video. Sorry that I don't know how to link thetiming :(.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_Q7hfVkj4\nYou can see the salmon still looks a bit rare.\nFeel the fish, if you are able to tear it up like he does in the video; its perfect.\nIf the fish still holds firm while you pull it, it probably needs a little longer.\nOne of the reason its still looks like this is because the egg whites haven't set because you didn't cook it in that smoking hot pan, but in a nice, comfy warm pan.\n\n\nAgain, this is my first post everrrrrr on Reddit, and I really hope it helped!!\nLet me know if you tried!",

Think for a moment what happens when you place a room temperature piece of salmon in the center of a large, hot pan. The salmon will immediately zap the heat from the portion of the pan it's in contact with, while the surrounding surface of the pan continues to charge with heat.\n\nThis large heat differential will cause the oil on the outside of the pan to become extremely hot and start to break down before the salmon is finished forming its crust. This is what's causing your oil to smoke like you describe, and you could also be getting some slight off flavors from the oil breaking down. You will also notice that the outer edge of your salmon's crust will be much darker than the interior of the crust because the outer surface of your pan is much hotter than the portion in contact with the salmon.\n\nGeneral rule of thumb, use a pan that is just large enough to allow the protein to lay flat in the pan without touching the sides. The tighter the fit, the more consistent your temperature drop and re-charge will be, resulting in a more consistent crust and less issues with your oil over-heating and breaking down.",

But it also doesn't take off all the oil when (and if you wear makeup or sunscreen you should) double cleanse. And that sucks. Also, I'm super cheap, like so cheap CeraVe is pricey for me (yes that sucks too) and so I began my search for the best cheap-as-hell cleanser. It took some time, loads of inci decoding, endless drugstore aisles scanning and some very debatable purchases (most of which make great shaving gel so I can live with that) but I did it. I've found it. Behold:\n\n[**Babylove Ultra Sensitive Waschbalsam**](https://www.dm.de/babylove-ultra-sensitive-kopf-bis-fuss-waschbalsam-p4058172434235.html)\n\n^(INCI:  AQUA | COCOGLUCOSIDE | COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE | GLYCERIN | HELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED OIL | PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS OIL | XANTHAN GUM | PANTHENOL | TOCOPHEROL | GLYCERYL OLEATE | TOCOPHERYL ACETATE | CITRIC ACID | SODIUM CHLORIDE | SODIUM BENZOATE) \n\nFirst of all this cleanser is cheap, very cheap. I mean it's 2 euros for 500ml. It's probably because it's for baby butts, not adult's faces but I've been using it for 2 months now and my face didn't yet turn into a baby butt so I'd say it's fine. Secondly, it's amazing. It's the exact mix of hydrating and foaming cleanser I always wanted and never got (that and a stove toy when I was 6).\n\nThe texture is between lotion and jelly (not a balm as the name suggests), which personally works great for me because it's thick enough not to spill from my palm but loose enough to be comfortably pumped out of the bottle and easily spread on the face. The cocoglucoside and cocoamidopropyl betaine are nice and gentle cleansers while still managing to get that oil and gunk off your face. I usually foam it up with some water in my palms which makes it easier to spread on the face but \"foam up\" isn't really accurate as it doesn't really make any foam, just occasional tiny bubbles.\n\nIt's alcohol and fragrance free and because it's for sensitive baby skin it's generally super gentle. It even gets into my eyes now and then and here I am not blind, writing this post so that speaks for itself. Last but not least it's in a pump bottle aka the best packaging currently existing (not counting airless pump) so you don't have to cover half of the bathroom in oil while trying to use that damn squeeze bottle and just push the pump with your elbow (yes, thank me for this tip later).\n\n[A pump bottle, I repeat a pump bottle](https://preview.redd.it/l1cqil8wpkk51.jpg?width=528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8825fb151217660e83a85a456f06920db06dc0dd)\n\n[Texture after pumping out, a jelly-like emulsion](https://preview.redd.it/7dl1laplpkk51.jpg?width=2592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc280f60342af27a2e9aa016f9e6bc4a0426e78c)\n\n[Texture after mixing with some water and foaming up a tiny bit \\(can be foamed up some more, but will never fully lather\\)](https://preview.redd.it/g9q4pqplpkk51.jpg?width=2592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d07026cc6164d714e8bb685a1de3c42aeb8c251c)\n\nTexture: 4/5  \nFeeling after cleansing: 4.5/5  \nSmell: 2/5 (quite medicinal)  \nPackaging: 5/5  \nOverall: 6/5 (come on it's 2 euros for HALF A LITER)\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk.",

    "body": "I've found one of the best and cheapest moisturisers I've ever used.\n\nFirst a summary of my skin is at the moment - I'm currently on isotretinoin (Accutane/Roaccutane) for mild but persistent adult acne.  I've been on it for about 3 months now and my skin has changed from extremely oily and acne prone to normal/dry and slightly sensitive.  After a LOT of trial and error, I finally landed on Redwin Hyaluronic Hydration.  It's about $6 for 220g at Chemist Warehouse!\n\nBefore trying the Redwin, I went through moisturisers from Skinceuticals (Triple Lipid Restore & Epidermal Repair), Cerave Cream, Cetaphil Daily Hydration, QV (Cream and Lotion), Avene Cicalfate, Dermaveen (Calmexa Cream), and Vanicream and none were completely right.  They either broke me out and clogged my pores or were uncomfortable to wear (too heavy, not hydrating enough, too sticky, odd smell, pilled with sunscreen).  The Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Restore was beautiful but it's extremely expensive and I went through a jar in about a month.  \n\nEnter the Redwin Hyaluronic Hydration.  What caught my eye initially was the lack of Ceteareth-20.  This emollient is found in almost every heavier moisturiser that's recommended for people on Accutane and I found it to be extremely pore clogging.  It was almost unavoidable. \n\nThe rest of the ingredients list looked pretty nice as well:\n\nWater, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristyl Myristate, Stearic Acid, PEG-100 Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, Carbomer, Chlorphenesin, Beeswax, Myristyl Laurate, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Squalane, BHT, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ascorbyl Palmitate\n\nWhat was there to lose?  It was only $6 and I could use it on the body if it didn't work for my face.  Boy, was I glad I picked this up.  Prior to accutane, I was a luxury skincare junkie and this moisturiser is one of the best I’ve ever tried in terms of texture and performance.\n\nSo here's why I love it:\n\n* It feels beautiful on - silky smooth and sinks right in. I can layer it over and over and it never does anything weird.  I feel hydrated and comfortable - it's never cloying or heavy even if you use huge amounts.  I'm glowy but never oily or greasy.\n* It’s the perfect mix of hydrating and occlusive.  You'd think it'll be heavy with liquid paraffin being the 2nd ingredient but it's very lightweight.\n* Works beautifully under sunscreen and makeup.  It doesn't pill and concealer doesn't slip and slide around.   \n* It’s  fragrance free and has not clogged my pores despite how much I use - a huge dollop multiple times a day and even reapplications over itself when I'm feeling drier than normal.  \n* It’s basic and no-frills enough that it’s not going to interfere with my treatment but still has some nice ingredients to nourish and improve the skin.\n\nAnd the best part - it’s  **$6 for 220g**! I go nuts and use it all over myself because it’s so cheap!\n\nI haven’t seen it mentioned much on here but it would be a cult product if more people tried it.  I think it would work for a lot of people.  Definitely check it out if you're looking for an excellent all-around basic moisturiser that just does what it's supposed to do.",

Ester forms of emollient alcohols are so common in Australian-made pharmacy products that I've basically given up on them completely because of it hahaha",

The company prides itself on having all aspects of production based in the US. From manufacturing from the chemist to the designers to the tube manufacturers, the product is 100% made in the U.S.A. Helmsman can be purchased direct from their site or on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/](https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman Original Scent is a light, refreshing scent that smell similar to many modern mens soaps and grooming products. This pleasant scent is hard to distinguish individual notes from. In general it is refreshing, clean and crisp. This scent is a nice divergence from complex scents and as such, Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She cannot really smell it once I rinse it away, making it a great user if you want your post shave product or fragrance of the day to dominate. Scent strength is light to mid out of the container and remains that way through the shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman brushless shave cream appears to be a vega based cream. Ingredients are listed as: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water, Stearic Acid, Sodium Methyl, Cocoyl Taurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana, Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Siloxanetriol Alginate, Caffeine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Boswellia Carterii Resin Extract, Silybum Marianum Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Calophyllum Tacamahaca Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Oleic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Ceramide, Sodium Chloride and Citric Acid. Being a brushless cream, this cream can be applied with your hand or a brush but does not require water. Primary and residual slickness are good. I am able to buff without visible lather with no fear of the razor skipping or dragging. Post shave is also good. I am not left dry or tight once rinsed away. The ShaveScore for Helmsman Shave Cream is an 82. For similar performance I suggest you check out: Castle Forbes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Helmsman Shave Cream (promotional gift)\n* Brush - N/A\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

There’s a lot of layers from the owner shipping it without preservatives and so it arrives rotten, as well as faking the nutritional facts and ingredients. Literally just typing in pink sauce and you’ll fall down the rabbit hole and all the mess within it. It’d be even better if you tried making it according to what she claims is in the pink sauce. She claims it’s made only from water, dragon fruit, sunflower seed oil, chillis, lemon juice, vinegar, milk and citric acid. And that’s it. Mind you, she’s shipping this out to people, $25, in the hot summer sun, and there’s not even preservatives listed in the ingredients?",

    "body": "Hey guys! So I've been seeing a lot of questions about the [Oil Cleansing Method](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) and I really wanted to emphasize the part in /u/ieatbugs write-up where she talks about how you can use multiple oils for the cleansing part. I'm seeing people getting frustrated after trying a couple of singular oils and I want to point out that many people who use the OCM method have found much success by combining various oils!\n\nPersonally, I like to use an almond oil/olive oil/jojoba oil (1:1:1) combo.\n\nI was hoping that people who use the OCM could post their combos here so other people who are new to the OCM could see what people are using. I know another combo a lot of people like is castor oil:grapeseed oil (1:3) or the traditional castor oil:sunflower seed oil (1:4). The traditional OCM uses castor oil as the cleansing oil and another oil as the carrier oil but many people (myself included) prefer to mix lighter oils.\n\nIf you're looking for a list of oils, [Garden of Wisdom has one](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/carrieroils.html) that is somewhat descriptive of their properties and might help you figure out which combo you might like.",

For $395!\n\n---\n\nIngredients:\n\n[Epi-Peel](http://store.tammyfender.com/products/Epi%252dPeel-%7C-Formula-No.-E%252d517-%281.9-oz%29.html): '*An award-winning facial-in-a-jar, this ultimate multi-tasker merits a permanent place in every beauty routine.*'\n\nAqueous Extracts of Hibiscus Sabdariffa, Rose Hips, Orange Peel, Lemongrass, Lemon Peel, Green Tea Leaf, Beeswax PEG-8, Cetearyl Alcohol (and) Ceteh 20 (Plant Source), Sunflower Seed Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Kaolin Clay, Rosemary Extract, Oat Extract, Essential Oils of Lavender, Spearmint and Rosemary, Zantham Gum (Plant Source), Glycerine, Oleoresin (Rosemary), Soybean Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid (and) Benzyl Alcohol (Natural Food Grade Preservative System) \n\n\n[Quintessential Serum](http://store.tammyfender.com/products/Quintessential-Serum-%7C-Formula-No.-QS%252d9-%281-oz%29.html): '*This all-in-one age-defying superstar is our most sought after product – delivering immediate nutrition, radiance and cell renewal.*' \n\nBrassica Campestris and Aleutrities Fordi Oil (*They are a polymer derived of possibly [turnip mustard oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_rapa) and something else which I wasn't not able to find any information on aleutrities fordi*), Rose Hip Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Avocado Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Pure essential oils of Rose, Frankincense, Chamomile, Oleoresin. \n\n---\n\nHere's the major crunch of Tammy Fender's Quintessential serum for less.\n\nI wasn't able to find any turnip mustard oil online but apparently it is a popular cooking oil in Indian cuisine and some E-articles said that it is actually canola oil. Maybe it is but maybe it is not. I didn't include here because the information on turnip mustard oil is very limited.\n\n[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65 \n\n[Sunflower Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3778998.htm) - 1 oz / $4.10\n\n[Avocado Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777612.htm) - 2 oz / $4.35\n\n[Evening Primrose Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/7037279.htm) - 1 oz / $4.45 \n\n[Rose EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rose-absolute-bulgaria.html) - 1/8 oz / $29 \n\n[Frankincense EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-e-g/frankincense-somalia.html) - 1/4 oz / $7\n\n[Chamomile EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-c-d/chamomile-german-blue.html) - 1/8 oz / $12 \n\n[Rosemary EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rosemary-ct-verbenone-france-organic.html) - 1/4 oz / $10\n\nTOTAL: $76.55\n\nWith these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.\n\nAs for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html).

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've posted quite a few times on here so I just wanted to give you my dyshidrosis update and what's given me relief so far!\n\nSo I developed staph-infected dyshidrosis all over my dominant hand during covid-summer after an extended use of steroid cream on a patch of eczema on my ring finger. I tried fungal meds, didn't work, and was put on antibiotics THREE TIMES as my hand got reinfected three times as soon as I ended the antibiotics, despite me using antibacterial prescription cream and a very strong steroid cream. I went on a round of anti scabies meds in case it was scabies (doubted it since my hand was very clearly DE), and had a hand biopsy which confirmed atopic dermatitis. I had blood work done including screenings for vitamin deficiency, kidney function, thyroid function, and autoimmune disease all of which came back fine except for vitamin D deficiency (which I'm now taking vitamins for). I tried eliminating common allergens one by one despite the fact I've never had contact allergies or food allergies (went off gluten for a bit, sugar for a bit, dairy for a bit, etc) and saw no symptom difference.  I tried tea tree oil since some ppl recommended it but it didn't make a difference for me. I tried both diluted ACV and bleach soaks but didn't help me much either. I replaced all my toiletries and haircare and laundry products with all natural products or at the very least paraben/sulfate/MI free products (can't emphasize how much eliminating MI gives relief with e.g. soaps). I was regularly moisturizing using Cerave cream only, and any toiletry I used I made sure it had a \"pump\" so it wouldn't be colonized with staph. I started wearing a cotton glove over my hand at night and often during the day.\n\nEventually when after the 3rd round of antibiotics my hand started to look suspiciously yellow again (sign of developing staph), I cut out the steroid cream I'd been on for a month, a) bcs I know you're not supposed to put on strong topicals for longer than that and b) bcs it just wasn't helping prevent infection and I started to question whether because of how the cream works (reducing immune function) it was actually encouraging infection. I'm not a doctor so I don't know, but after giving up the steroid I just applied my antibacterial cream along with Pycnogenol solution by the Ordinary twice a day as I'd been doing before. Can't emphasize how much the Pycnogenol gives physical symptom relief even if it didn't solve the infected looking parts or stop the blistering, so thanks to the Reddit users who recommended it! And I began to focus on trying to build up my skin barrier again using oils that also had antibacterial properties - I tried black seed oil (which I also regularly drink a spoon of), coconut oil, and sunflower seed oil. These were nice but...\n\nY'all. Shoutout to the woman on FB who recommended all natural hempseed oil because this stuff is a MIRACLE. I started putting it on around 2 or 3x a day - and within days the two suspiciously yellowing parts of my hand (which had ALWAYS developed into full blown infection before) COMPLETELY cleared up. In the past couple weeks of using it my DE blisters have almost disappeared across my hand, my skin is still very delicate but it closed (i.e. not peeling), and much of the reddening is gone. I have use of my dominant hand almost like normal again thank God!!! I very much believe that the super high level of omega fatty acids in the hempseed oil are what helped heal my hand, so I've also started taking a supplement. \n\nMy hand still gets a little bit itchy and I'd like to fully cut out the part of my hand still prone to a little blistering, and so my doctor recommended soaking my hand for 20 min in water before applying my steroid cream again (since the skin on palms is so thick it needs to be softened for meds to work apparently). I'm going to try that soon since it seems the hemp oil is doing all it can do rn. Hoping that this post helps other people too!",

You can check to make sure your sunflower seed oil is high-linoleic by seeing if it's high in polyunsaturated fat (on the label).\n\n**Oils with Gamma Linolenic Acid (with their percentages Gamma Linolenic Acid):**\n\nBlack Currant\t\"high level\" according to GoW - 12.6% gamma-linolenic acid according to [this source](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/nutrition-research/learning-center/plant-profiler/ribes-nigrum.html)\n\nBorage\t20.1\n\nEvening Primrose\t9.1\n\n\n\nedit 1: formatting\n\nedit 2: added Sunflower Seed Oil to the list, and more data for Black Current Seed Oil, because of helpful comments from /u/_ihavemanynames_ and /u/Firefox7275",

But why then are some of the most highly recommended oils (including argan, neem, etc.) so high in oleic acid? \n\nWhat I've concluded from my (brief) research into the topic is that there's a lot more to choosing an individual oil than the fatty acid composition. These oils all contain a lot of different and varied chemicals/molecules beyond the fatty acids that provide their unique benefits. As one example, beyond the FAs listed on GoW, they list the following: \"Triterpenes, more specifically, limonoids such as azadirachtin, salannin, meliantriol, nimbin, nimbidin, meliantriol, deacetylazadirachtinol, salannin, salannol, 3-deacetylsalannin etc.\" \n\nLastly, can you provide sources on the topical use of gamma linolenic acid and its benefits? I haven't been able to find too much on that one [except this source on dietary use](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24553997). Mostly just LA and ALA.",

        "body": "Did you know that sunflower seed oil usually also has a linoleic acid content of over 50%? The GoW one is a specific high oleic version - which has the benefit of having a longer shelf life. \n\nAccording to [this cosmetic chemistry blog](http://swiftcraftymonkey.blogspot.nl/2014/07/one-ingredient-ten-products-sunflower.html), sunflower oil normally contains 61-71% linoleic acid. \n\nYou can even check if your own supermarket/health food store carries the type of sunflower seed oil that's high in linoleic acid, by looking at the label. This is because oleic acid is a monounsaturated fat, while linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated fat. So if you see a high percentage of polyunsaturated fats and a low percentage of monounsaturated fats: you've got the right one :)\n\n(edited because I can't type, apparently)",

From my own experience, it seems that linoleic oils such as hemp seed, rosehip (especially), passionfruit, and evening primose have helped my skin out the most when it comes to evening out the tone and diminishing active acne and scarring.    \nI do notice however that these oils are a bit.. dryer feeling? If that makes any sense. They soak right into my skin and I find that I often have to follow up with an additional oil or moisturizer and that's where oleic oils come in handy for me since I find they usually take longer to sink into my skin and create a moisture barrier.",

        "body": "I've used safflower seed oil in my OCM and really liked it.  It's non-comodogenic (at least all the data I found indicated it's so) and worked very well for that purpose.  I blended it with mineral oil and since it's a bit thicker than mineral oil it gave my cleansing oil a nice heaviness if you like that.  I don't always like that though haha because it makes it a bit harder to rinse off, but if I'm using a microfiber cloth to remove the oil then it can give my skin a bit of protection from the cloth (though the cloth is pretty dang soft obvi).\n\nI've also used evening primrose oil as a leave-on over my moisturizer at night and definitely noticed a difference in the hydration levels of my skin.  The one thing I didn't know about, and maybe someone can answer this question, is this:  At night I use a hyaluronic acid serum, followed by cerave PM, followed sometimes by the EPO.  I also use a humidifier in my room at night.  My question is this: Is the oil acting as enough of an occlusive that when I use it, I don't get the benefit of the humidifier?  Obviously the hyaluronic+moisturizer+oil is a good combo, and obviously the hyaluronic+moisturizer+humidifier is another good combo, but do the oil & humidifier working against each other or cancel each other out in some way?",
