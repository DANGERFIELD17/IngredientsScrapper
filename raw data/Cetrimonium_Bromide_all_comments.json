    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.  No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

Holy butt. I normally go through a ton of conditioner trying to detangle with a comb (and water to provide extra slip). Y’all I didn’t even need a comb or water, like, this bs let me detangle my hair with my hands when I flipped it upside down to style. I never expected to be able to do that, ever. 10/10 great detangler for me. \n\n**Moisturizes/Hydrates?**: Also very strong yes from me. I have high porosity/protein loving hair, granted, but this has turned my stubborn ends soft and wonderful! Usually my curls dry out pretty easily, but they stayed hydrated! Although, I did use too much the first time and ended up with slightly oily looking curls, but damn if my hair was not super soft and defined. It also was curlier than usual for a wash n go. I can’t wait to see what happens with gel. 10/10\n\n**Other thoughts:** \n\n1. I really appreciate that you can use this on wet or dry hair \n\n2. The consistency is on the thinner side, but not runny at all unless you put water in it. \n\n3. I will cherish it forever. This is a HG for me. \n\n",

    "body": "Korean Cosmetic F/W Products – Internet Based Brand\n\nLast time, I wrote about the new products from prominent Korean road shop brands so, this time I have prepared an article about smaller, online based boutique brands. Since I am a business related person, I won’t mention any products that we carry or we will carry in the near future to maintain subjectivity. Actually, most of the products are not available in US market yet but most of the products will come to US sooner or later (hate to admit, but maybe from our competitors, lol)  I mean, checking out the new products is just a very exciting thing. Isn’t it? \n\nApril Skin: Magic All Kill Cleansing Water \n\nSo, probably you’ve heard about April Skin because of their makeup products or Pink Piggy Carbonated Mask (We don’t carry this product, T_T don’t hate me.) So, this time they introduced new cleansing water with Hinoki Cypress water. This cleansing water has pretty simple ingredient list, like PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, dipropylene glycol and some other extracts. Even though PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides (EWG 3, it is a potential allergen) cannot be considered super safe ingredient but this a cleansing water, so it seems inevitable to put some sort of surfactant for cleansing. Generally, the ingredient list doesn’t seem very harsh and it has quite a good customer reviews as well. I’ve checked out some videos as well and it cleanses point makeups really well. Cetrimonium bromide is on the ingredient list, so please be aware of it, if it concerns you (This ingredient has big scandle in Korean baby wet-tissue so I mentioned in here.). The oral toxicity is known about this ingredient but since this is just a cleansing water, so I assume it is not so problematic. After I tested this, I think this cleansing water is somewhat between cleansing water and cleansing oil. It leaves a quite a bit of moisture on the skin after use. \n\nStyle Nanda, 3CE: Glow Jam Stick Supa Dupa\n\nStyle Nanda was founded as an online based fashion brand and expanded their business to cosmetic under the sub-brand called 3CE. With beautiful package design and magazine like page design, 3CE quickly became a major player in the market as well. (We don’t carry this brand.) Currently, they introduced a new color on their Glow Jam Stick line. The color is a conventional coral-peach color that Korean people love. The interesting point of Glow Jam Stick line is that this lip is quite glossy but has good color presentation at the same time. So, if you like matt type lipstick, this is not gonna be your favorite but this jelly like texture makes lips look quite glamorous and healthy. It felt pretty creamy and watery but the color doesn’t last very long like lip tint. But I think it’s a good lipstick for winter, and this triangular package is just so cute. \n\nSo Natural, Centella Facial Thin Mask \n\nProbably, So Natural is one of the first brands that used Centella Asiatica as a cosmetic ingredient in Korea. Probably, this brand seems a little new to you, but their Facial Oil and Centella-Scar Bal m are quite popular in Korea for a quite long time. This year, they introduced 0.22mm sheet mask with Centella Asiatica extract. The formula is quite similar to other famous sheet masks but they added quite a bit of moisturizing ingredients and good amount of niacinamide. As its name suggests, it contains a bit of centella asiatica extract as well, just too little to benefit from it. However, overall the ingredient lists are quite good and this Lyocell cotton has good skin affinity so I think it is worth to try. (We don’t carry this brand T_T)\n\nSidmool : Dr. Troub Skin Returning Zinc Mask \n\nActually, I am a little reluctant to confirm the efficacy of this product because the toxicity of nano-sized zinc oxide has been actively researched and the zinc oxide’s skin clarifying & calming effect is less clarified. However, Sidmool successfully launched Zinc oxide cream and it has been extremely popular between Koreans. Anyway, the good thing is Sidmool used large molecular size zinc oxide (7%) and good amount of propolis extract (40%), and this is a wash off type pack. So, they added Kaolin and bentonite clay that are commonly used for pore masks. Generally, Sidmool is an ingredient conscious company and most of their popular products are made for acne/breakout –prone skin, so if you are a little more adventurous K-beauty fan, Sidmool is a definitely must-try company. \n\nThank You Farmer: Back to Iceland Peeling Cream\n\nThis is an interesting named peeling “cream.” Generally, most of the K-beauty peeling products are cellulose based gel-type, but this product is a little thicker than other peeling gels (but this has a gel like texture.) They added bryophyte from Iceland, rich in Lichenin which is a known anti-inflammatory agent. They also added BHA and PHA seemingly to strengthen the peeling effect. I guess if you have oily skin or problem with flaky skin, this can be a good peeling gel. I think some of competitors sell products from Thank You Farmer, and you can order this product through G-Market global shopping. I have relatively dry skin so I personally don’t use this type of product but I think it removed dead skin really well. \n\nPapa Recipe: Bombee Honey Pudding Cream \n\nSo, it’s hard to mention Papa Recipe without its Bombee line. After the blazing popularity of its Bombee Honey masks, they introduced “Bombee Honey Pudding Cream.” Actually, this cream is not a really new product but not so many vendors (nor us) carry this product because of its price (54,000 KRW, around 50 USD.) It has jelly like texture but it is easily melted on the skin. Just like many other their Bombee line, it smells like honey. It hydrates skin quite nicely without leaving much oily layer. For its price, the ingredient is not very impressive since it contains lots of extract but not so much active ingredients. It does contain some good moisturizing factors but I don’t think this cream is moisturizing enough for dry skin people especially for winter. If you like water-gel texture, it’s a good gel-type cream for winter. \n\nCosRx: One Step Moisture Up Pad\n\nArguably one of the most famous online Korean brands in US, CosRX introduced a new pad-type toner. I am pretty sure you have heard about or tried their Pimple Pad, popularized by many vendors. So, Moisture-Up Pad is for the dry skin, while Pimple Pad was for the oily skin. It contains propolis extract as a base and several common hydration ingredients. Embossed side is used for dead skin removal and the other side is for patting. If you don’t like to use toner and cotton pad, this can be a convenient product but in terms of the ingredients and packaging, it is a pretty vanilla product. \n\nVant 36.5 VT Essence Skin Foundation Pact \n\nVant 36.5 introduced melting foundation, inspired by Age 20 (one of the Korean home shopping brand.) Since it is a melting foundation, the finish is pretty moisturizing. It gives pretty dewy finish. This melting foundation covers skin complexion slightly better than other melting foundations in the market. The tone is slightly lighter than normal melting foundation, and water-drop texture (solid foundation become watery by rubbing) gives pretty moisturized look on your face without much oxidization. I wouldn’t say this gives very natural look on the face, but surely it does makes your skin dewy and brighter, without leaving oily layer. \n",

However, whenever I use random drugstore hair products (whatever's in the shower at an AirBnB or at my in-laws, etc) I get what I can only describe as \"weird body\" to my hair. My hair is straight, moderately oily, fairly fine, and pretty sparse. When I use my LUSH stuff and air dry, it ends up sleek and shiny and lies close to my head (I usually wear it up because it's long and I have little kids). With other products, it dries kind of puffy and is much less likely to stay pulled back nicely. If I leave it down, it's a lot less straight, but not in a flattering bouncy blowout kind of way -- more like sleeping on wet hair when it dries funny.\n\nI'm sure this is an ingredients issue, but I don't know enough about haircare to identify the problem!

Doesn't mean you can't find cheaper version, just explains why yoy haven't found in the one-size-fits-most types of shampoos in most people's showers.

I hope I'm doing this right!\n\nSo, this is the [Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micelle Solution](http://www.amazon.com/Bioderma-Sensibio-H2O-micelle-solution/dp/B003GE49A4). \n\nSo this is supposed to be a **makeup remover solution, both for eyes and face**, and it works magically. (it's better than anything I've used, even those irritating face wash stuff that even though I rub it on my face and clean with water, doesn't completely remove my makeup). And it's SUPER easy.\n\n**How does it work?** The solution itself is comprised of clusters of molecules. These clusters, when applied on the skin, causes them to break open, sucking impurities from the skin’s surface without friction. There is no irritation in the skin and no overdry feeling either! Thank you, science!\n\n**What and who is it for?** Well, it says on the product that it's for Sensitive skin, but it's made to work with every type. I have a combination, acne prone skin and it works perfectly fine with me. I've used it to clean my face in the mornings, too, and it feels so squiky clean all the time.\n\nThe application is sooo easy. As it says on the website: *Soak a cotton pad with Sensibio H2O and cleanse the face and eyes and/or remove any make-up. Repeat the application until the cotton pad remains clean.* It looks like water, but it smells different. Not a bad smell, though. :) And no reactions at all!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/QtcTKyF\n\nI got this to remove my make-up, and I've read some great reviews about it before so I wanted to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I don't feel the need to wash my face for 10 minutes anymore.\n\nI've been using this for a few days now, and I usually use it when I come home. I feel the need to remove my makeup right after I get home, so I clean my face with it whenever. And I clean again in the morning. You can use it at night before bed, too, since it doesn't have any acids in it or anything..\n\n**Ingredients** as taken from Bioderma's website.\nWATER (AQUA), PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, CUCUMIS SATIVUS (CUCUMBER) FRUIT EXTRACT, MANNITOL, XYLITOL, RHAMNOSE, FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES, DISODIUM EDTA, CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE.",

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition. You can also check out my post on [Hygral Fatigue](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hygral-fatigue.html) to learn more about maintaining balance between moisture and protein in your hair. ",

This has proven trickier than I’d expected as SF is both viscous and rich in proteins and polysaccharides which potentially inhibit amplification.\n\nFortunately, there is a small body of literature which examines precisely this problem.\n\nOne very effective protocol calls for the addition of the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB / cetrimonium bromide) after initial lysis, followed by chloroform extraction.\n\nMy question: is there any problem with substituting cetrimonium chloride (CTAC) instead of cetrimonium bromide in this application? Is there something about the chemical properties of bromide anions that makes them more suitable here than chloride anions?\n\nThank you",

I Shampoo/Condition my hair 2-3 times a week and dried with a T-shirt. Everything was going great until a week ago where I noticed my hair didn't feel the same anymore. I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

        "body": "I bought my second bottle two months ago. It works well on my skin and on acne that just started to appear. I use it in my night routine after I was my face with water or with Eucerin ph5 wash bar/ syndet. I do have sensitive skin that hates fragrance in most of the products. I recommend you to try this product by pouring it directly on your face or problematic areas or applying it in your palm and tapping it in with your fingers. When I use cotton pads in general my face gets red. So with this product, I decided to not use them too even if they recommend it so. The product isn't too harsh nor too light. After the application my face isn't stinging nor red. \n\nThis exfoliating toner has a really high efficiency when it comes to vanishing pimples that just started to form (when you feel a tiny bump forming under your skin or a bit of light stinging and redness before the pimple appears). Apply it in this time and it will help a lot, the pimple will dissappear without forming a head or anything similar. At least this is how it  works for me. \n\nAfter the toner, I use Bionike defence aqua spray. Followed by Cosrx Snail mucin essence / Vichy mineral 89 probiotic fractions serum and last Uriage Bariederm Cica cream. Don't make that mistake and use nothing moisturizing after you apply an exfoliating product on your face. Make sure that the essence, serum or moisturizer that you apply after contains no acids but only ingredients that help your skin barrier.\n\nEdit: spelling and additional information",

I would probably by a few to stock up and would definitely pay you for the cost of shipping. Please do let me know!\n\nAlso, for other DIYers, do you think I would be better off just buying the ingredients from scratch? I was thinking of mixing/heating the water, propylene glycol, and xylitol since these two are water soluble. Then heating the cetrimonium bromide with the capric glycerides and then adding this mix to the water solution. Your input is very much appreciated!!",

    "body": "I'm so grateful for AB to have taught me how to take care of my face properly!! Thank you so much guys\n\nBut I have been struggling with a problem recently. I've been living in Korea for 2 years and since then I've tried many new (especially Korean) facial products. In the beginning of 2014, my routine was:\nCleanse: Cetaphil | Toner: Etude House Malgem Smoother | Essence: Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence | Lotion: Cetaphil Lotion | Bb cream: The Face Shop Power Perfection BB Cream. Sometimes the occasional sheet mask or mud mask (usually Innisfree).\n\nThis worked until a certain extent, when I started breaking out some and when I switched products in summer, I started breaking out a lot (using mostly highly fragranced Laneige/Iope products). It worsened dramatically when I started eating a lot of ice cream (anyone knows Korean Bingsoo? I ate that every day in summer...), yoghurt and milk. I have a history of being allergic to milk when I was younger, so cutting that out was the first thing I did. After that, I stopped the usage of any fancy face products, except for an oil cleanser (Body Shop), face cleanser (La Roche Posy Toleriane Dermo Cleanser) and moisturizer (Cetaphil Lotion during the day and Cetaphil Cream during the night), and the occasional usage of BB cream (Hanskin Super Magic BB Cream). \nI should also add that my face is *normal-dry*: mostly normal in summer and dry in winter.\n\nSince then, I have tried introducing many products. I will include a list of products that didn't work for me, including their ingredient lists.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion** (gave me closed comedones and a pimple): *Water, Butylene Glycol,

Before i just used a [cleanser](http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Refreshing-Facial-Wash-Gel-50ml_955963/) in the shower in the morning or just washed oil off my face with water.    \n  \n    \n  I've introduced two new products the [Avene cleanance](https://www.sanareva.co.uk/avene-cleanance-water-micellar-400ml.html)  and moisturiser [LA ROCHE-POSAY EFFACLAR duo+](http://www.feelunique.com/p/La-Roche-Posay-Effaclar-Duo-Unifiant-40ml?option=69761&gclid=CjwKEAiA6YDBBRDwtpTQnYzx5lASJAC57ObMvvJsGXV7U_Sa5fHEQ0L7_l-VeHBYAPBchLpWzKYB-RoCCcrw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).     \n\n\n  So I'm thinking either the cleanser is causing a purge or breaking me out. The ingredients are: **AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC  GLYCERIDES. PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE. DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE. GLYCERYL LAURATE.**    \n\n\n  I now see it has **butylene glycol** and **pentylene glycol** which are glycolic acids(?) which might be causing a slight purge? so ultimately should I stick to this routine and hope in 3 weeks the acne heals while also looking to treat/conceal the active acne and blemishes OR switch to my initial cleanser that i used in the shower? I have used 3 in the past [simple](http://www.boots.com/en/Simple-Kind-To-Skin-Refreshing-Facial-Wash-Gel-50ml_955963/), [nivea men](http://www.boots.com/en/NIVEA-MEN-Sensitive-Face-Wash-100ml_922607/) (which seemed to work really well), and [simple kind to skin](http://www.wilko.com/facial-cleansing/simple-kind-to-skin-moisturising-facial-wash-150ml/invt/0170376?gclid=CjwKEAiAjIbBBRCitNvJ1o257WESJADpoUt02kmceNAU5pfroS3G0QXi2O570VkPVsAfO_aZ_KFhjRoCJ4Xw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) (which strangely felt like it broke me out more than the other 2). \n\n**bonus point:** I tried the simple kind to skin face wash today instead of avene cleanser and although the avene cleanser doesn't feel tight or necessarily uncomfortable i can feel a difference in cleanser and the simple feels well more comfortable.

        "body": "I'm not gonna explain every ingredient because I honestly have a lot of homework to be doing and reddit won't give me the room for it all in one comment, but I'll give you the highlights and a general conclusion.\n\n**Shampoo:** \n\n- Has mid-strength anionic surfactants (e.g. sodium cocoyl alaninate, disodium and sodium cocyl glutamate), so a good sulfate-free alternative but there are even gentler things out there. The up side is these surfactants also function as conditioners.\n\n- The main surfactant sodium bis-hydroxyethylglycinate coco-glucosides crosspolymer is a non-ionic which is the gentlest kind of surfactant. It's a cleansing, foaming, thickening, as well as conditioning agent. Also biodegradable, which is helpful when we think about how much of all these products get washed down our drains.\n\n- Glycerin is a common humectant that pulls water into the hair and is thus very beneficial in a shampoo where you want the shower water to replenish your moisture content.\n\n- Parfum (fragrance): The fact that this is so high up on the ingredients list gives me a little worry. Fragrance can be almost anything, and most fragrance ingredients contain phthalate esters which have been linked to many health ailments. The presence of this ingredient in the first third of the list leads me to believe that it is likely in a concentration near or above harmful when used in long exposures (but almost all plastics we have around us also emit harmful levels of these chemicals into the air so it's not like the absence of this shampoo will make everything all better, nor are you guaranteed to get diabetes or breast cancer just from being exposed like this. It just raises the risk). \n\n- Arginine: an amino acid with significant protective abilities. When used in the presence of bleach, [reduces protein depletion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15645092). Also improves hair growth by [stimulating blood flow to the follicles](http://www.aminoacid-studies.com/areas-of-use/hair.html?PHPSESSID=jof4d69o6cc5gonk508kplsd04).\n\n- The others are mainly conditioning agents to coat the hair strand and improve it's softness, shine, and manageability or are emulsifiers to hold the whole mixture together. \n\n- **Conclusion: Pretty good shampoo. Not the best thing you could ever find, but this will be better for most people than sulfate shampoos. For your SD though, it may still be too harsh so pay close attention to see if you get itchiness, redness, and flakes when using this shampoo, especially because most people with SD need to wash every day and that means more exposure to it.**\n\n**Conditioner:**\n\n- Cetyl alcohol: a common fatty alcohol used in hair products. It coats the hair to protect it from protein damage and loss as well as seal in moisture, both of which this compound is pretty good at. May clog follicles and weigh down fine hair, however, so try not to use this much on your scalp. \n\n- Avocado oil: Another conditioner that coats. Rather thick, so this plus the cetyl alcohol may mean this conditioner is too heavy for fine hair, but avocado oil also has some vitamins and amino acids to protect from protein loss. Not penetrative however, so not a ton of this benefit. \n\n- See above for fragrance, arginine, protein.\n\n- Citric and ascorbic acid are lower pH than your hair, so they will tighten up the hair shaft and help make it shinier. [Some evidence](http://www.ergo-log.com/vitchair.html) also suggests that exposure to ascorbic acid can help protect hair follicles from the hair loss effect of androgens. \n\n- Nearly all of the other ingredients are various conditioners. \n\n- **Conclusion: I don't think this is the best conditioner for you. It might be too heavy on your thin hair, and will probably irritate your SD. You could try pairing it with a clarifying shampoo though and see if that makes it more bearable.**\n\n**Serum:**\n\n- cyclomethicone and cyclopentasiloxane: silicones, but the gentlest class of silicones. Most penetrative to water molecules and easiest to evaporate and remove in the shower. \n\n- [C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700898/C12-15_ALKYL_BENZOATE/): A fairly long-chain alcohol and thus conditioner. Suspected to be an environmental toxin. Soluble, won't build up. \n\n- Silk amino acids are great at strengthening the hair and partially rebuilding damage. \n\n- Shea butter is a heavy but effective emollient. \n\n- Coconut milk and oil are some of the best conditioners out there and also penetrate to deliver moisture and reparation. \n\n- Egg whites and acetate have some reconstructive power, but probably aren't doing much this far down the list. \n\n**Conclusion: sounds pretty good, but will probably work best if you apply it to damp hair rather than dry so that it don't lock out moisture and doesn't feel greasy.**",

You are only adding it to your sample (not the blank), so clearly it is interacting with the CTAB somehow. Here's the method taken directly from the monograph:\n\n\"Assay— Transfer 2.0 g of Cetrimonium Bromide, accurately weighed, to a 100-mL volumetric flask, and dissolve in and dilute with water to volume. Transfer 25.0 mL of this solution to a separatory funnel, and add 25 mL of chloroform, 10 mL of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide VS, and 10.0 mL of a freshly prepared solution of potassium iodide (1 in 20). Shake well, allow to separate, and discard the chloroform layer. Wash the aqueous layer with three 10-mL portions of chloroform, and discard the washings. Transfer the aqueous layer to a stoppered conical flask, add 40 mL of hydrochloric acid, allow to cool, and titrate with 0.05 M potassium iodate VS until the deep brown color is almost discharged. Add 2 mL of chloroform, and continue the titration, shaking vigorously, until the color of the chloroform layer no longer changes. Perform a blank titration on a mixture of 10.0 mL of a freshly prepared solution of potassium iodide (1 in 20), 20 mL of water, and 40 mL of hydrochloric acid, and make any necessary correction. Each mL of 0.05 M potassium iodate is equivalent to 36.45 mg of Cetrimonium Bromide (C19H42BrN).\"\n\n\nIs it to prevent the CTAB from falling out of solution? Thank you in advance for your help!",

It’s been years and I’ve never been able to find a product that works for my skin with the exception of the ONE moisturizer that works which is the Makezia Moisturizer. Other than that every other moisturizer, sunscreen, and cleanser has irritated my skin in some way. I’ve tried using occlusive like vasaline and aquaphor and I can’t tolerate those either. I’ve even done allergy patch testing which came out with negative results for everything. I haven’t encountered someone else with this issue yet and was wondering if you guys had any advice on what I should do now. My skin on my body reacts the same way. \n\nFor a measure on how sensitive my skin is, I tried a micellar water with these ingredients: Aqua (Water), Poloxamer 184, Glycerin, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetrimonium Bromide, BHT, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nAnd I also was irritated by a product with literally water, Hyaluronic acid and a few preservatives: Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.\n\nAny advice would be helpful!

I was wondering if anyone could give any recommendations or let me know if there's anything in my routine which could be aggravating my skin as at the moment I have loads of breakouts on my chin for no reason which I think is inflammation rather than acne.\n\nCurrent routine:\n- Morning: Wash with warm water, moisturise with Eucerin Dermopurifyer Adjunctive Hydrating Care\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Tapioca Starch, Alcohol Denat, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carnitine, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Decylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Sodium Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n- Evening: Remove makeup with Bioderma Sensibo miscellar water \nIngredients: WATER (AQUA), PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, CUCUMIS SATIVUS (CUCUMBER) FRUIT EXTRACT, MANNITOL, XYLITOL, RHAMNOSE, FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARIDES, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DISODIUM EDTA, CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE.\n\nThen moisturise with Eucerin Dermo Purifyer Night Care\nIngredients: Aqua, Cyclomethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 prone skin.\nMethylglucose Distearate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol,\nSorbitan Stearate, Lactic Acid, Panthenol,\nPEG-150 Distearate, Bisabolol, Serine, Glycine,\nLecithin, Alanine, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium EDTA,\nPhenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Parfum, CI 77891\n\nI find the night cream really drying so at the moment so I need a replacement for it.\n\nMy main requirements are: suitable for sensitive skin, moisturising, gentle so won't cause breakouts, anti-ageing (I'm 20 so want to prevent ageing).\n\nThank you.",

        "body": "Parfum is what caught my eye right away. Parfum, or Fragrance in an ingredient list is a dead giveaway. They are usually made up of up to thousands of individual ingredients that the company doesn't have to list. Many of the ingredients contain allergens or toxins which can irritate the skin and also damage your skin's natural collagen. \n\nAlso, when looking for a new product, make sure to be aware of Mineral Oil. Mineral oil just sits on the skin, doesn't allow your skin to breath, and also does not allow other ingredients to penetrate your skin. However, mineral oil is in so many lotions because it is a cheap ingredient.\n\nThose are the two main ingredients I watch out for, but I know nothing of the other ingredients. If another ingredient is irritating your skin, you might want to opt for an all-natural moisturizer such as coconut oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil, among many others.",

Bioderma is a gentle cleanser, but it [won't necessarily remove] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPwyvO-Bzt8) all traces of full make up and sunscreen. Residual make up [may increase irritation.] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2380419/What-sleeping-make-does-skin-Our-shocking-experiment-exposes-happens.html) If you wear much make up you might add a fragrance free oil based/ silicone based/ dual phase eye make up remover, these are often gentle enough to use on a larger area but do try to ind out the pH.\n\nYour first anti ageing product is sunscreen, all mineral is better or hypersensitive skin. I rate Derma-e Antioxidant Natural sunscreen SPF 30 which has 1% green tea extract and a little vitamin C (SAP form). The body version is a larger pack size than the face version.\n\nDifferent moisturiser ... CeraVe PM Lotion is fragrance free, light enough for under make up,  4% niacinamide is suited to many skin conditions and has anti ageing properties.",

I can go a whole day at work without getting oily and this toner is one of the reasons for that. If you can suggest a more high street based price tag that would be brilliant as I find most toners really don't do anything for me.

    "body": "Hey all,\n\nSo it's summer in the UK - not a crazily hot one, but a warm and humid one nonetheless - and I'm wondering whether my moisturising routine is actually too heavy for me right now? The main reason I'm asking is because my face has been feeling very itchy and a little bit tight (with very small eczema patches on my chin that are currently coming and going as they please) to the point where it's disturbing my sleep and distracting me throughout the day. \n\nI think my routine is really great as I used to have BAAAD acne breakouts (gonna be creating a B&A post soon!) and now I'm totally clear, but I fear that because I put it together during the colder months it's giving my face too much moisturiser that, during summer, it doesn't need. \n\nRoutine: \n\nAM: **splash with water**, pat semi-dry, **apply Cetaphil Moisturising Cream** (Ingredients: AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, PETROLATUM, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, DIMETHICONE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS OIL / PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, PEG-30 STEARATE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, BENZYL ALCOHOL, DIMENTHICONOL DISODIUM EDTA, GLYCERYL ACRYLATE/ ACRYLIC ACID COPOLYMER, METHYLPARABEN, PENOXYETHANOL, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PROPYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE), **apply Pure 100% Argan Oil**. Then primer and makeup routine (very light; 1 layer of foundation). \n\nPM: **1st cleanse with No7 Beautiful Skin Cleansing Oil** (Ingredients: Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Isononyl Isononanoate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Isohexadecane, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopheryl Acetate, Isopropyl Myristate, Ascorbyl Palmitate.) \n**2nd cleanse with Avene Extremely Gentle Cleansing Lotion** (Ingredients: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA), CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SERINE, CETRIMONIUM BROMIDE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DISODIUM PHOSPHATE, o-PHENYLPHENOL, SODIUM CETEARYL SULFATE, WATER (AQUA)). Wipe away excess Avene with cotton pad and splash rinse.\n\nDo you think the Cetaphil moisturiser is too heavy for summer now? That's the main one I'm unsure about. I know I don't have an exfoliating product in my routine right now either but that's because every time I used one, even gentle methods, it broke me out/gave me dry patches. \n\nAny comments at all are much appreciated!

However, the high  salinity of the reservoir condition along with high temperature has a  detrimental effect on the performance of both polymers and  nanoparticles. Common polymers and nanoparticles are usually degraded  and begin to aggregate with the salinity increment. The purpose of this  research is to provide a comprehensive review on the combination of  general/thermoassociative polymers with low salinity water and  nanoparticles as three new approaches for the chemical EOR process. The  most previous studies have been concerned application of polymers and  nanoparticles in the EOR, recommending usage of thermoassociative  polymers (resistant under high salinity and high temperature conditions)  as a substitution of common viscosifiers, and also as a good stabilizer  of nanofluids to provide a higher stability for nanoparticles. All  makes new polymer materials as a promising candidate for offering some  ideas to see the polymer complexity world and its pros/cons as a one of  the promising EOR agent.\n\n**Keywords:** General polymer; Tanoparticle; Thermoassociative polymers; EOR process\n\n**Abbrevations:** EOR: Enhanced  Oil Recovery; IFT: Interfacial Tension; PAM: Polyacrylamide; HPAM:  Hydrolyzed PAM; HSHT: High Salinity and High Temperature; LoSal: Low  Salinity; CTAB: Cetrimonium Bromide; SDS: Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; CMC:  Critical Micelle Concentration; PVP: Polyvinylpyrrolidone; PPNs:  Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles; PSt: Polystyrene; TAP: Thermo Associative  Copolymers\n\n## [Introduction](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Introduction)\n\nCarbonate reservoirs account for more than 60% of the  world’s oil. However, due to the presence of the fracture network and  oil-wet matrix, oil recovery from naturally fractured carbonate  reservoirs has always been a challenging issue. Hence, application of  EOR methods especially chemical EOR has been recently gained a lot of  attention by researchers to obtain a higher recovery of carbonate  reservoirs. Application of polymers and nanoparticles are a good example  of chemical agents each of which has a specific effect on the reservoir  rock and fluid properties. The govern mechanism of polymer flooding is  the viscosity enhancement of aqueous solution, while nanoparticles lead  to the Interfacial Tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration of  reservoir rocks. Common polymers such as Polyacrylamide (PAM) and  Hydrolyzed PAM (HPAM) usually exhibit a high degree of chemical  degradation against High Salinity and High Temperature (HSHT) reservoirs  which results in the solution viscosity reduction with the salinity and  temperature increment \\[1\\]. Hence, various researches have been  conducted concerning application of Low Salinity (LoSal) water with  polymers in order to mitigate the detrimental effect of high salinity \\[2-4\\]. High salinity also has a worse effect on nanofluids stability \\[5\\]. However, application of thermoassociative polymers which  are stable in high salinity and high temperature conditions, can be a  good agent compensate for the effect of high salinity on polymers and it  can also be applied as a stabilizer for nanofluid solutions to obtain a  higher stable nano-suspension.\n\nIn this paper, a comprehensive review of the most  recent studies has been conducted in order to analyze the application of  the polymers combination with low salinity water, nanoparticles, and  combination of nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoassociative polymers in EOR  process.\n\n## [Results and Discussion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Results%20and%20Discussion)\n\n### [Combination of Polymers with Low Salinity Water](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Combination%20of%20Polymers%20with%20Low%20Salinity%20Water)\n\nShiran et al., \\[2\\], investigated the effect of the  low salinity water and hydrolyzed HPAM on the oil recovery and observed  an increment in the total recovery which is mainly due to the  combination effect. Vermolen et al., \\[1\\], expressed these combination  effects and claimed that combination of the LoSal/polymer will improve  the oil sweep efficiency through the trapped oil mobilization which are  detached from the rock surface due to the wettability alteration. In  order to precisely shown the effect of brine salinity on polymer solution viscosity, a semi-log diagram of polymer viscosity vs. brine salinity is shown in Figure 1. As it is obvious, two plateau ranges are observed where the reservoir brine salinity is in the ranges of lower plateau, while low salinity brine is on the steep part of the graph in which the polymer viscosity is highly sensitive to the brine salinity. They concluded that the amount of the required polymer for obtaining a target viscosity is lowered by the usage of LoSal which is favorable for economic considerations. Furthermore, they observed an increase in the stability of polymer at the high temperatures when it is combined with LoSal confirming the application of LoSal/polymer at high salinity and high temperature conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, AlSofi et al., \\[3\\] have investigated the simultaneous usage of a sulfonated polyacrylamide polymer with the smart water (salinity of 10 times lower than the injected water) and they observed the required polymer concentration for achieving a specific viscosity is reduced (from 3,000ppm to 2,000ppm) in the case of smart water instead of high salinity ones (Figure 2). Besides, core-flooding experiments have shown a significant increment in the oil recovery by smart water/polymers comparing to the separate cases. The effect of LoSal combination with the polymer on controlling polymer gel blocking in the fractured reservoirs have been analyzed by Brattekas et al. \\[4\\]. They observed that the gel fracture blocking is improved via LoSal as a chase water. Hence, the fractures will be successfully blocked to divert the flow direction toward matrix blocks.\n\n### [Standalone Nanoparticles for EOR Purposes](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Standalone%20Nanoparticles%20for%20EOR%20Purposes)\n\nDue to the unique properties of nanoparticles, their applications have been recently suggested as a promising EOR method. NPs have small size (1 to 100nm) assisting them to flow through a typical reservoir pore spaces (lower than 1micron). Besides, their surface properties can be manipulated in order to become more appropriate for desirable application \\[6\\]. In order to get insight into the actual mechanisms by which NPs improve the oil recovery from reservoirs, a number of researches have been conducted that some of them are explained below.\n\nSiO2: The applicability of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs on the efficiency of Cetrimonium Bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant has been analyzed by Ravera et al. \\[7\\]. A reduction in the IFT was observed due to the adsorption of positively charged CTAB on the surface of silica NPs (in 1wt% nanosuspension). In another research conducted by Ma et al. in 2008, the efficiency of Hydrophilic SiO2 NPs was also analyzed on the performance of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) as an anionic surfactant and Triton X-100 as a non-ionic surfactant. They observed hydrophilic SiO2 NPs improve the influence of SDS in the IFT reduction which may be due to the presence of repulsive forces between negatively charged SDS and SiO2 NPs. However, they do not affect the performance of Triton X-100 because of existing poor interactions \\[8\\]. Zargartalebi et al., \\[9\\] investigated the influence of hydrophilic and slightly hydrophobic SiO2 NPs (0.2wt%) on the SDS performance, observed a reduction in the surfactant adsorption on the sandstone surface in the presence of NPs especially for hydrophobic ones. Besides, they claimed that the influence of NPs on the IFT reduction was completely dependent on the surfactant concentration. As it is illustrated in Figure 3a and Figure 3b, at low surfactant concentration up to Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), IFT values continuously reduced. However, above CMC value, the IFT began to increase and finally reached to a constant value even lower than the one obtained by surfactant alone.\n\nThe ability of silane treated SiO2 and hydrophobic SiO2 NPs (with a concentration of 0.3wt% dispersed in ethanol) in the wettability alteration of reservoir rock has been firstly observed by Ogolo et al. in 2012 \\[10\\]. After a year, Li et al. confirmed the high efficiency of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs in both IFT reduction and wettability alteration of sandstones in the presence of 30,000ppm NaCl solution with 0.05wt% NPs, showing an optimum concentration \\[11\\]. Furthermore, Roustaei et al., \\[12\\] investigated the potential of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs in the presence of 50,000ppm NaCl solution in EOR of carbonate rocks and they concluded that at an optimum concentration of 0.4wt%, maximum wettability alteration is obtained. They also claimed that NPs result in increasing IFT when the wettability is altered toward water-wetness and this IFT increment contributes in the oil recovery improvement. Their assertion is based on the concept of spontaneous imbibition in carbonate reservoirs. Recently, the effect of temperature and size of SiO2 NPs has been analyzed by Al-Anssari et al., \\[13\\] and they concluded that the temperature has a positive effect on SiO2 NPs ability to alter wettability of oil-wet carbonate rocks; however, the effect of NPs size is negligible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZrO2: Karimi et al., \\[14\\] investigated the process of spontaneous imbibition of 5wt% ZrO2 nanofluid into an oil-wet carbonate reservoir. They claimed that adsorption of hydrophilic synthesized ZrO2 NPs and the mixture of nonionic surfactants onto the rock surface leads to the formation of a nano-textured surface which can modify reservoir rock wettability toward more water-wetness better than NPs alone and consequently more oil is recovered.\n\nAl2O3: Ogolo et al., \\[10\\] claimed that Al2O3 NPs (dispersing in distilled water or brine with a salinity of 30,000 ppm) perform well in EOR due to the oil viscosity reduction. However, a year later, Giraldo et al., \\[15\\] observed that Al2O3 can also alter the wettability of sandstones from severe oil-wet to severe waterwet when synthesized by an anionic surfactant. Among a wide range of nanofluid concentration between 0.01 to 1wt%, the efficiency of surfactant to wettability modification is improved just at a relatively low NPs concentration (equal or lower than 0.05wt%). Besides, they asserted that imbibition experiments are a good evaluation tool for analyzing the performance of NPs. The ability of Al2O3 NPs for IFT reduction is expressed by Joonaki et al., \\[16\\] and they observed that the interfacial tension between phases began to reduce when propanol is used as a dispersing agent for Al2O3 NPs.\n\nTiO2: Ehtesabi et al., \\[17\\] investigated the application of synthesized TiO2 NPs through core-flooding experiments in sandstone rocks and they confirmed their application in EOR in terms of wettability alteration and oil viscosity reduction. They observe that TiO2 NPs do not affect the oil viscosity but in a low concentration of 0.01wt% could alter significantly the wettability of rock surface. Application of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs in oil-wet carbonate reservoirs have been analyzed by Esfandyari et al., \\[5\\] under various temperatures (26, 40, 50, 60 ℃). The maximum and minimum reduction in contact angles were achieved by SiO2 and Al2O3 NPs, respectively at all temperatures. Besides, they observed a reduction in oil viscosity at higher temperatures of 50 and 60 ℃ by Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs and the oil recovery by Al2O3. TiO2 was also more significant at all temperatures comparing to SiO2 NPs. The potential of these three hydrophilic NPs has been also investigated by Hendraningrat et al. in different wettability sandstone reservoirs. They confirmed the mechanism of wettability alteration as the main mechanism of these NPs although IFT reduction is also observed. As a result of their experiments, TiO2 NPs performed well in all types of wettability systems among other NPs \\[18\\]. Generally, the mechanism by which NPs alter the reservoir rock wettability is due to the creation of a wedge-film on the rock surface due to the disjoining pressure enhancement between oil and rock surface (Figure 4). Consequently, the oil droplets will detach from the rock surface and a new underlying layer is exposed with a more water-wetness wettability \\[19\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### [Stability of Nanoparticles](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Stability%20of%20Nanoparticles)\n\nOne of the main challenges of nanofluids which limits their application especially in long period is their stability. Forming an agglomeration may restrict the flow of NPs through micronsized pore spaces and may lead to pore spaces plugging and permeability reduction \\[18\\]. Zeta potential of nanofluid has a direct relationship with the suspension stability in a way that the suspension with higher zeta potential (even positive or negative) shows higher stability. The water chemistry such as pH, ionic strength (salinity) and its various component usually influence the stability of nanofluids \\[20\\]. Accordingly, it is expected that adjusting the pH value of system, reducing its salinity or adding a stabilizer to the nano-suspension will provide a higher stability for system. Adjusting pH value: The pH value of a nanofluid solution influence their surface charge and consequently their stability. According to Huang et al. there exist an optimal pH value by which a maximum nanofluid stability is obtained. They have conducted a series of experiments on Al2O3 and CuO nanofluids in which the pH value of the solution is adjusted by addition of HCl or NaOH to obtain an acidic or basic suspension. They observed that Al2O3 and CuO nano-suspension obtain the highest stability at an optimum pH value of 7.5- 8.9 and 7.5-9.5, respectively \\[21\\].\n\nEffect of salinity: Esfandyari et al., \\[5\\] measured the zeta potential of the nanofluid of Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 in various dispersion media of deionized water, NaCl solution (3,000 ppm) and synthetic brine (25,000ppm). As a result of their experiments, the zeta potential values of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 in deionized water are -38.5, 31.1 and -19.1mV, respectively indicating the highest to lowest stable nanofluids. However, the zeta potential values of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 nanofluids have been decreased to -32.3, 27.4 and -15.8 in NaCl solution and to -22.4, 21.6 and -9.9 in the synthetic brine respectively, all of which indicate the detrimental effect of salinity on the stability of nanofluids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding stabilizer: Hendraningrat et al., \\[18\\] analyzed the stability of nanofluid of Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 NPs. Analysis of nanofluids visual stability show that Al2O3 NPs precipitated at initial stages (approximately after 3 hs) and TiO2 NPs precipitated slightly later. However, SiO2 NPs exhibit a better stability of 24-48hrs. In order to get longer stability of Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs, they proposed addition of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizer to alter NPs surface conductivities, resulting in 96 and 48h stability for Al2O3 and TiO2 nanofluids, respectively. The influence of pH value, existence of divalent cations presented in water and surfactant concentration as a stabilizer on TiO2 nanofluid stability have been analyzed by Loosli et al. \\[20\\]. They observed that when the pH values are altered from pH=3 (addition of HCl) to pH=11 (addition of NaOH) the zeta potential continuously decreased from +36mV to -40mV. At a pH range of 5-7.2, the absolute zeta potential values are minimum indicating the range of instability. Zeta potential is equal to zero at a pH value of 6.1, indicating the most instable situation. Besides, they also concluded that the presence of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) leads to the more agglomeration of NPs due to the cation bridging. In contrast, they claimed that adsorption of negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate, as an anionic surfactant, onto the positively charged surface of TiO2 NPs make the nano-suspension more stable. The influence of pH changes and the presence of divalent cations on the stability of TiO2-SDS complexes are illustrated in Figure 5.\n\n### [Thermoassociative polymers](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Thermoassociative%20polymers)\n\nIn order to prevent chemical degradation of commercial PAM during EOR in high salinity and high temperature conditions, Tamsilian et al., \\[22\\] have synthesized a protected Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles (PPNs) in which a hydrophobic polystyrene (PSt) sell is created by one-pot two-step inverse emulsion surface polymerization method. The existence of hydrophobic PSt shell protects the active PAM chains from degradation in harsh reservoir conditions. Besides, the efficiency of PPNs as a viscosity modifier is increased by their timedependent releasement; hence, it will remain active in a wide range of approximately 30 days. A schematic of PPNs polymer flooding is illustrated in Figure 6. PPNs have a high potential of IFT reduction and wettability alteration in comparison with common PAM and according to the results of incremental oil recovery, an average of 6.9% and 5.95% was obtained by PPNs and PMA, respectively; which indicates PPNs better capability in oil recovery improvement. Finally, a comparison between the performance of PAM and PPN introduces PPNs as a good candidate for EOR processes, due to their high capability in viscosity increment even harsh conditions and also IFT reduction and wettability alteration although a lower amount of it is required for achieving same recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShaban et al., \\[23\\] have synthesized a new cauliflowerlike amphiphilic copolymer by aerosol-photopolymerization method. A schematic of their experimental setup consists of an atomizer, a flow-through photoreactor, and a collection filter is shown in Figure 7. The advantage of this method over usual methods such as emulsion polymerization is that no surfactants are required. They concluded that their new method of synthesis has a great ability to produce novel copolymers with large amount of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers. Hence, it has a long applicability to viscosity enhancement during the process of polymer-flooding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother new type of acrylamide-based Thermo Associative Copolymers (TAP), applicable in high salinity and high temperature reservoirs, have been considered by the current research community, called Nano Chemical Group, through the process of a copolymerization mechanism of free-radical of acrylamide monomer and thermosensitive macromonomers. In a saline reservoir, the viscosity of a solution is augmented if the temperature is above a critical value called associating temperature. Meanwhile, it is expected that addition of a type of stabilizer which is highly resistant in high salinity conditions could provide a desired stability for nanofluids at high salinity conditions. Considering this in mind, the novel hydrophobically thermoassociating copolymer (HTAP) consisting of polyacrylamide and polystyrene, prepared by Tamsilian et al., \\[22\\], which has been recently used as EOR agent is recommended to stabilize NPs to compensate for the detrimental effect of high salinity.\n\n## [Conclusion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Conclusion)\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive review has been conducted on the combination of polymers with low salinity water, nanoparticles, and thermo associative polymers, providing three new approaches for the polymer EOR process. The following conclusions can be obtained from the reviewed researches:\n\nI. Due to the negative impact of the salinity on the efficiency of polymer, application of low salinity water with common polymers mitigates its worse effect, resulting in more oil recovery. Besides, the required polymer amount for achieving the same viscosity is lower comparing to the cases in which high salinity water is used.\n\nII. SiO2 nanoparticles results in more oil recovery by the wettability alteration of the reservoir rock and IFT reduction. ZrO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by wettability alteration and Al2O3 nanoparticles by IFT reduction, wettability alteration and oil viscosity reduction lead to oil recovery improvement all of which are among the effective nanoparticles.\n\nIII. The stability of nanofluids is affected by the water chemistry such as pH, ionic strength (salinity) and its various components. There exists an optimum value of pH by which maximum stability is obtained for each nanofluid. Salinity has usually a detrimental effect on nanofluids stability and result in their agglomeration.\n\nIV. Thermoassociative polymers which their efficiency remain stable at the high salinity and high temperature conditions, are suggested as a promising substitution for common polymers and also as a stabilizer of nanofluids at high salinity harsh conditions.\n\nV. Reviewing these three aspects of polymer applications in the EOR process shows a good thought streamline for research groups who are active to see the polymer complexity world and its pros/cons as a one of the promising EOR agent.\n\n  \n\nFor more Open Access Journals in [Juniper Publishers ](https://juniperpublishers.com/index.php)please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)\n\nFor more articles in [ Academic Journal of Polymer Science ](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php)please click on:  \n [https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php) \n\nFor more [Open Access Journals](https://juniperpublishers.com/) please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)",

However, the high  salinity of the reservoir condition along with high temperature has a  detrimental effect on the performance of both polymers and  nanoparticles. Common polymers and nanoparticles are usually degraded  and begin to aggregate with the salinity increment. The purpose of this  research is to provide a comprehensive review on the combination of  general/thermoassociative polymers with low salinity water and  nanoparticles as three new approaches for the chemical EOR process. The  most previous studies have been concerned application of polymers and  nanoparticles in the EOR, recommending usage of thermoassociative  polymers (resistant under high salinity and high temperature conditions)  as a substitution of common viscosifiers, and also as a good stabilizer  of nanofluids to provide a higher stability for nanoparticles. All  makes new polymer materials as a promising candidate for offering some  ideas to see the polymer complexity world and its pros/cons as a one of  the promising EOR agent.\n\n**Keywords:** General polymer; Tanoparticle; Thermoassociative polymers; EOR process\n\n**Abbrevations:** EOR: Enhanced  Oil Recovery; IFT: Interfacial Tension; PAM: Polyacrylamide; HPAM:  Hydrolyzed PAM; HSHT: High Salinity and High Temperature; LoSal: Low  Salinity; CTAB: Cetrimonium Bromide; SDS: Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate; CMC:  Critical Micelle Concentration; PVP: Polyvinylpyrrolidone; PPNs:  Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles; PSt: Polystyrene; TAP: Thermo Associative  Copolymers\n\n## [Introduction](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Introduction)\n\nCarbonate reservoirs account for more than 60% of the  world’s oil. However, due to the presence of the fracture network and  oil-wet matrix, oil recovery from naturally fractured carbonate  reservoirs has always been a challenging issue. Hence, application of  EOR methods especially chemical EOR has been recently gained a lot of  attention by researchers to obtain a higher recovery of carbonate  reservoirs. Application of polymers and nanoparticles are a good example  of chemical agents each of which has a specific effect on the reservoir  rock and fluid properties. The govern mechanism of polymer flooding is  the viscosity enhancement of aqueous solution, while nanoparticles lead  to the Interfacial Tension (IFT) reduction and wettability alteration of  reservoir rocks. Common polymers such as Polyacrylamide (PAM) and  Hydrolyzed PAM (HPAM) usually exhibit a high degree of chemical  degradation against High Salinity and High Temperature (HSHT) reservoirs  which results in the solution viscosity reduction with the salinity and  temperature increment \\[1\\]. Hence, various researches have been  conducted concerning application of Low Salinity (LoSal) water with  polymers in order to mitigate the detrimental effect of high salinity \\[2-4\\]. High salinity also has a worse effect on nanofluids stability \\[5\\]. However, application of thermoassociative polymers which  are stable in high salinity and high temperature conditions, can be a  good agent compensate for the effect of high salinity on polymers and it  can also be applied as a stabilizer for nanofluid solutions to obtain a  higher stable nano-suspension.\n\nIn this paper, a comprehensive review of the most  recent studies has been conducted in order to analyze the application of  the polymers combination with low salinity water, nanoparticles, and  combination of nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoassociative polymers in EOR  process.\n\n## [Results and Discussion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Results%20and%20Discussion)\n\n### [Combination of Polymers with Low Salinity Water](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Combination%20of%20Polymers%20with%20Low%20Salinity%20Water)\n\nShiran et al., \\[2\\], investigated the effect of the  low salinity water and hydrolyzed HPAM on the oil recovery and observed  an increment in the total recovery which is mainly due to the  combination effect. Vermolen et al., \\[1\\], expressed these combination  effects and claimed that combination of the LoSal/polymer will improve  the oil sweep efficiency through the trapped oil mobilization which are  detached from the rock surface due to the wettability alteration. In  order to precisely shown the effect of brine salinity on polymer solution viscosity, a semi-log diagram of polymer viscosity vs. brine salinity is shown in Figure 1. As it is obvious, two plateau ranges are observed where the reservoir brine salinity is in the ranges of lower plateau, while low salinity brine is on the steep part of the graph in which the polymer viscosity is highly sensitive to the brine salinity. They concluded that the amount of the required polymer for obtaining a target viscosity is lowered by the usage of LoSal which is favorable for economic considerations. Furthermore, they observed an increase in the stability of polymer at the high temperatures when it is combined with LoSal confirming the application of LoSal/polymer at high salinity and high temperature conditions.\n\nRecently, AlSofi et al., \\[3\\] have investigated the simultaneous usage of a sulfonated polyacrylamide polymer with the smart water (salinity of 10 times lower than the injected water) and they observed the required polymer concentration for achieving a specific viscosity is reduced (from 3,000ppm to 2,000ppm) in the case of smart water instead of high salinity ones (Figure 2). Besides, core-flooding experiments have shown a significant increment in the oil recovery by smart water/polymers comparing to the separate cases. The effect of LoSal combination with the polymer on controlling polymer gel blocking in the fractured reservoirs have been analyzed by Brattekas et al. \\[4\\]. They observed that the gel fracture blocking is improved via LoSal as a chase water. Hence, the fractures will be successfully blocked to divert the flow direction toward matrix blocks.\n\n### [Standalone Nanoparticles for EOR Purposes](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Standalone%20Nanoparticles%20for%20EOR%20Purposes)\n\nDue to the unique properties of nanoparticles, their applications have been recently suggested as a promising EOR method. NPs have small size (1 to 100nm) assisting them to flow through a typical reservoir pore spaces (lower than 1micron). Besides, their surface properties can be manipulated in order to become more appropriate for desirable application \\[6\\]. In order to get insight into the actual mechanisms by which NPs improve the oil recovery from reservoirs, a number of researches have been conducted that some of them are explained below.\n\nSiO2: The applicability of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs on the efficiency of Cetrimonium Bromide (CTAB) as a cationic surfactant has been analyzed by Ravera et al. \\[7\\]. A reduction in the IFT was observed due to the adsorption of positively charged CTAB on the surface of silica NPs (in 1wt% nanosuspension). In another research conducted by Ma et al. in 2008, the efficiency of Hydrophilic SiO2 NPs was also analyzed on the performance of Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) as an anionic surfactant and Triton X-100 as a non-ionic surfactant. They observed hydrophilic SiO2 NPs improve the influence of SDS in the IFT reduction which may be due to the presence of repulsive forces between negatively charged SDS and SiO2 NPs. However, they do not affect the performance of Triton X-100 because of existing poor interactions \\[8\\]. Zargartalebi et al., \\[9\\] investigated the influence of hydrophilic and slightly hydrophobic SiO2 NPs (0.2wt%) on the SDS performance, observed a reduction in the surfactant adsorption on the sandstone surface in the presence of NPs especially for hydrophobic ones. Besides, they claimed that the influence of NPs on the IFT reduction was completely dependent on the surfactant concentration. As it is illustrated in Figure 3a and Figure 3b, at low surfactant concentration up to Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC), IFT values continuously reduced. However, above CMC value, the IFT began to increase and finally reached to a constant value even lower than the one obtained by surfactant alone.\n\nThe ability of silane treated SiO2 and hydrophobic SiO2 NPs (with a concentration of 0.3wt% dispersed in ethanol) in the wettability alteration of reservoir rock has been firstly observed by Ogolo et al. in 2012 \\[10\\]. After a year, Li et al. confirmed the high efficiency of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs in both IFT reduction and wettability alteration of sandstones in the presence of 30,000ppm NaCl solution with 0.05wt% NPs, showing an optimum concentration \\[11\\]. Furthermore, Roustaei et al., \\[12\\] investigated the potential of hydrophilic SiO2 NPs in the presence of 50,000ppm NaCl solution in EOR of carbonate rocks and they concluded that at an optimum concentration of 0.4wt%, maximum wettability alteration is obtained. They also claimed that NPs result in increasing IFT when the wettability is altered toward water-wetness and this IFT increment contributes in the oil recovery improvement. Their assertion is based on the concept of spontaneous imbibition in carbonate reservoirs. Recently, the effect of temperature and size of SiO2 NPs has been analyzed by Al-Anssari et al., \\[13\\] and they concluded that the temperature has a positive effect on SiO2 NPs ability to alter wettability of oil-wet carbonate rocks; however, the effect of NPs size is negligible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZrO2: Karimi et al., \\[14\\] investigated the process of spontaneous imbibition of 5wt% ZrO2 nanofluid into an oil-wet carbonate reservoir. They claimed that adsorption of hydrophilic synthesized ZrO2 NPs and the mixture of nonionic surfactants onto the rock surface leads to the formation of a nano-textured surface which can modify reservoir rock wettability toward more water-wetness better than NPs alone and consequently more oil is recovered.\n\nAl2O3: Ogolo et al., \\[10\\] claimed that Al2O3 NPs (dispersing in distilled water or brine with a salinity of 30,000 ppm) perform well in EOR due to the oil viscosity reduction. However, a year later, Giraldo et al., \\[15\\] observed that Al2O3 can also alter the wettability of sandstones from severe oil-wet to severe waterwet when synthesized by an anionic surfactant. Among a wide range of nanofluid concentration between 0.01 to 1wt%, the efficiency of surfactant to wettability modification is improved just at a relatively low NPs concentration (equal or lower than 0.05wt%). Besides, they asserted that imbibition experiments are a good evaluation tool for analyzing the performance of NPs. The ability of Al2O3 NPs for IFT reduction is expressed by Joonaki et al., \\[16\\] and they observed that the interfacial tension between phases began to reduce when propanol is used as a dispersing agent for Al2O3 NPs.\n\nTiO2: Ehtesabi et al., \\[17\\] investigated the application of synthesized TiO2 NPs through core-flooding experiments in sandstone rocks and they confirmed their application in EOR in terms of wettability alteration and oil viscosity reduction. They observe that TiO2 NPs do not affect the oil viscosity but in a low concentration of 0.01wt% could alter significantly the wettability of rock surface. Application of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs in oil-wet carbonate reservoirs have been analyzed by Esfandyari et al., \\[5\\] under various temperatures (26, 40, 50, 60 ℃). The maximum and minimum reduction in contact angles were achieved by SiO2 and Al2O3 NPs, respectively at all temperatures. Besides, they observed a reduction in oil viscosity at higher temperatures of 50 and 60 ℃ by Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs and the oil recovery by Al2O3. TiO2 was also more significant at all temperatures comparing to SiO2 NPs. The potential of these three hydrophilic NPs has been also investigated by Hendraningrat et al. in different wettability sandstone reservoirs. They confirmed the mechanism of wettability alteration as the main mechanism of these NPs although IFT reduction is also observed. As a result of their experiments, TiO2 NPs performed well in all types of wettability systems among other NPs \\[18\\]. Generally, the mechanism by which NPs alter the reservoir rock wettability is due to the creation of a wedge-film on the rock surface due to the disjoining pressure enhancement between oil and rock surface (Figure 4). Consequently, the oil droplets will detach from the rock surface and a new underlying layer is exposed with a more water-wetness wettability \\[19\\].\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### [Stability of Nanoparticles](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Stability%20of%20Nanoparticles)\n\nOne of the main challenges of nanofluids which limits their application especially in long period is their stability. Forming an agglomeration may restrict the flow of NPs through micronsized pore spaces and may lead to pore spaces plugging and permeability reduction \\[18\\]. Zeta potential of nanofluid has a direct relationship with the suspension stability in a way that the suspension with higher zeta potential (even positive or negative) shows higher stability. The water chemistry such as pH, ionic strength (salinity) and its various component usually influence the stability of nanofluids \\[20\\]. Accordingly, it is expected that adjusting the pH value of system, reducing its salinity or adding a stabilizer to the nano-suspension will provide a higher stability for system. Adjusting pH value: The pH value of a nanofluid solution influence their surface charge and consequently their stability. According to Huang et al. there exist an optimal pH value by which a maximum nanofluid stability is obtained. They have conducted a series of experiments on Al2O3 and CuO nanofluids in which the pH value of the solution is adjusted by addition of HCl or NaOH to obtain an acidic or basic suspension. They observed that Al2O3 and CuO nano-suspension obtain the highest stability at an optimum pH value of 7.5- 8.9 and 7.5-9.5, respectively \\[21\\].\n\nEffect of salinity: Esfandyari et al., \\[5\\] measured the zeta potential of the nanofluid of Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 in various dispersion media of deionized water, NaCl solution (3,000 ppm) and synthetic brine (25,000ppm). As a result of their experiments, the zeta potential values of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 in deionized water are -38.5, 31.1 and -19.1mV, respectively indicating the highest to lowest stable nanofluids. However, the zeta potential values of SiO2, Al2O3 and TiO2 nanofluids have been decreased to -32.3, 27.4 and -15.8 in NaCl solution and to -22.4, 21.6 and -9.9 in the synthetic brine respectively, all of which indicate the detrimental effect of salinity on the stability of nanofluids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding stabilizer: Hendraningrat et al., \\[18\\] analyzed the stability of nanofluid of Al2O3, TiO2 and SiO2 NPs. Analysis of nanofluids visual stability show that Al2O3 NPs precipitated at initial stages (approximately after 3 hs) and TiO2 NPs precipitated slightly later. However, SiO2 NPs exhibit a better stability of 24-48hrs. In order to get longer stability of Al2O3 and TiO2 NPs, they proposed addition of Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizer to alter NPs surface conductivities, resulting in 96 and 48h stability for Al2O3 and TiO2 nanofluids, respectively. The influence of pH value, existence of divalent cations presented in water and surfactant concentration as a stabilizer on TiO2 nanofluid stability have been analyzed by Loosli et al. \\[20\\]. They observed that when the pH values are altered from pH=3 (addition of HCl) to pH=11 (addition of NaOH) the zeta potential continuously decreased from +36mV to -40mV. At a pH range of 5-7.2, the absolute zeta potential values are minimum indicating the range of instability. Zeta potential is equal to zero at a pH value of 6.1, indicating the most instable situation. Besides, they also concluded that the presence of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) leads to the more agglomeration of NPs due to the cation bridging. In contrast, they claimed that adsorption of negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulfate, as an anionic surfactant, onto the positively charged surface of TiO2 NPs make the nano-suspension more stable. The influence of pH changes and the presence of divalent cations on the stability of TiO2-SDS complexes are illustrated in Figure 5.\n\n### [Thermoassociative polymers](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/Thermoassociative%20polymers)\n\nIn order to prevent chemical degradation of commercial PAM during EOR in high salinity and high temperature conditions, Tamsilian et al., \\[22\\] have synthesized a protected Polyacrylamide Nanoparticles (PPNs) in which a hydrophobic polystyrene (PSt) sell is created by one-pot two-step inverse emulsion surface polymerization method. The existence of hydrophobic PSt shell protects the active PAM chains from degradation in harsh reservoir conditions. Besides, the efficiency of PPNs as a viscosity modifier is increased by their timedependent releasement; hence, it will remain active in a wide range of approximately 30 days. A schematic of PPNs polymer flooding is illustrated in Figure 6. PPNs have a high potential of IFT reduction and wettability alteration in comparison with common PAM and according to the results of incremental oil recovery, an average of 6.9% and 5.95% was obtained by PPNs and PMA, respectively; which indicates PPNs better capability in oil recovery improvement. Finally, a comparison between the performance of PAM and PPN introduces PPNs as a good candidate for EOR processes, due to their high capability in viscosity increment even harsh conditions and also IFT reduction and wettability alteration although a lower amount of it is required for achieving same recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShaban et al., \\[23\\] have synthesized a new cauliflowerlike amphiphilic copolymer by aerosol-photopolymerization method. A schematic of their experimental setup consists of an atomizer, a flow-through photoreactor, and a collection filter is shown in Figure 7. The advantage of this method over usual methods such as emulsion polymerization is that no surfactants are required. They concluded that their new method of synthesis has a great ability to produce novel copolymers with large amount of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers. Hence, it has a long applicability to viscosity enhancement during the process of polymer-flooding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother new type of acrylamide-based Thermo Associative Copolymers (TAP), applicable in high salinity and high temperature reservoirs, have been considered by the current research community, called Nano Chemical Group, through the process of a copolymerization mechanism of free-radical of acrylamide monomer and thermosensitive macromonomers. In a saline reservoir, the viscosity of a solution is augmented if the temperature is above a critical value called associating temperature. Meanwhile, it is expected that addition of a type of stabilizer which is highly resistant in high salinity conditions could provide a desired stability for nanofluids at high salinity conditions. Considering this in mind, the novel hydrophobically thermoassociating copolymer (HTAP) consisting of polyacrylamide and polystyrene, prepared by Tamsilian et al., \\[22\\], which has been recently used as EOR agent is recommended to stabilize NPs to compensate for the detrimental effect of high salinity.\n\n## [Conclusion](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/AJOP.MS.ID.555572.php#Conclusion)\n\nIn this study, a comprehensive review has been conducted on the combination of polymers with low salinity water, nanoparticles, and thermo associative polymers, providing three new approaches for the polymer EOR process. The following conclusions can be obtained from the reviewed researches:\n\nI. Due to the negative impact of the salinity on the efficiency of polymer, application of low salinity water with common polymers mitigates its worse effect, resulting in more oil recovery. Besides, the required polymer amount for achieving the same viscosity is lower comparing to the cases in which high salinity water is used.\n\nII. SiO2 nanoparticles results in more oil recovery by the wettability alteration of the reservoir rock and IFT reduction. ZrO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by wettability alteration and Al2O3 nanoparticles by IFT reduction, wettability alteration and oil viscosity reduction lead to oil recovery improvement all of which are among the effective nanoparticles.\n\nIII. The stability of nanofluids is affected by the water chemistry such as pH, ionic strength (salinity) and its various components. There exists an optimum value of pH by which maximum stability is obtained for each nanofluid. Salinity has usually a detrimental effect on nanofluids stability and result in their agglomeration.\n\nIV. Thermoassociative polymers which their efficiency remain stable at the high salinity and high temperature conditions, are suggested as a promising substitution for common polymers and also as a stabilizer of nanofluids at high salinity harsh conditions.\n\nV. Reviewing these three aspects of polymer applications in the EOR process shows a good thought streamline for research groups who are active to see the polymer complexity world and its pros/cons as a one of the promising EOR agent.\n\n  \n\nFor more Open Access Journals in [Juniper Publishers ](https://juniperpublishers.com/index.php)please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)\n\nFor more articles in [ Academic Journal of Polymer Science ](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php)please click on:  \n [https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php](https://juniperpublishers.com/ajop/index.php) \n\nFor more [Open Access Journals](https://juniperpublishers.com/) please click on: [https://juniperpublishers.com](https://juniperpublishers.com/)",
