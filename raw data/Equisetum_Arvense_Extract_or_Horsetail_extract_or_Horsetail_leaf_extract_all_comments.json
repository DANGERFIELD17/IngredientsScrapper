    "body": "Part 2 based on u/winwinnwinnie’s comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hair/comments/t82slz/mending_split_ends_part_2_with_castor_oilsebacic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nYou can temporarily mend split ends together with the ingredients polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer. Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nSince last year, my hair has been falling out at an alarming rate. I’ve always had really thick, curly hair and a lot of it. Sadly, PCOS has taken one of the only parts of me I really liked and left me with very thin, sparse hair. \n\nI’ve been on BC and Metformin and that helped for a bit but about 3 months ago my hair loss has come back with a vengeance.\n\nTHANKFULLY...through much trial and error I found the perfect mix of supplements that have *decreased my hair loss by at least 50%* (just estimating from the hair shedding from my office and shower lol). I’m not too sure about hair regrowth but I’m happy to say that these supplements have really stopped my hair from falling out as frequently and in large amounts. \n\nEvery day I’ve been taking:\n\n5,000 IU of Vitamin D3\n\n5,000 mcg of Vitamin B-12\n\n10,000 mcg of Biotin\n\n2 tablets of Silica Complex with Horsetail Extract (this was THE GAME CHANGER)\n\nAnd 1 daily tablet of Centrum Adult Multivitamins\n\nIt took about 4-6 weeks to see any notable changes.  \n\nI’m also considering taking a Maca Root supplement...has anyone had any good experiences from it? I heard it can mess with your BC :/ \n\nAnyways, hope this helps someone!",

Already been using minoxidil this whole year and may for life if I can't protect my scalp enough from future breakage and hair loss with rosemary and castor oil solely. I feel better than when I started out, feeling my head for the horrors that were and seeing so much hair fall through my hands. Silicia seems to be the one I didn't know could help so much and perhaps get my hair back to what it was before i put my body in shock from not eating like I should have and everything else that followed. Just ordered some and looking forward to the future. Thank god for everyone brave enough to post about their experiences on Reddit and thank you.",

Unfortunately the hormonal changes post partum left me with two massive bald spots, and made looking in the mirror feel depressing (hair loss plus looking more tired than ever before). In December, i started taking saw palmetto once a day, and horsetail extract twice a day, while working more spinach, black chickpeas, blue berries and guava into my diet. After 4 months of being consistent and not missing a day, i have a weird, almost fur like short hair covering both bald patches. It’s not spectacular, but still an improvement. I’m going to continue, and hope for further improvements.",

        "body": "Useful list, thanks for making it! I’ve tried a few of them and have opinions on some others: \n\nPolypodium - it really works, I use it when I go to the beach or something else with a lot of sun exposure. The whole SPF from the inside thing does freak me out a bit so I don’t take it daily. \n\nZinc - good for wound healing, immunity, and nails. You can get it from food (pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds are great sources) but supplements are very safe so long as the dosage is low and/or it’s combined with a small dose of copper because the largest risk of getting too much zinc is copper deficiency. Up to 15mg/day of zinc is ok without copper or you can get a higher dose that includes like 1mg copper.\n\nCarotenoids - wouldn’t recommend isolated beta carotene supplements because of link to cancer risk but getting lots of beta carotene from carrots and sweet potatoes is completely safe and healthy. Can give you an orangeish tinge that some people like. Lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are safe and good for older people at risk of macular degeneration especially if they have blue eyes. Astaxanthin is safe but probably not necessary. Lycopene is very good for men with increased risk of prostate cancer or who already have it. \n\nI would not recommend anyone ever take a retinol vitamin A supplement unless your doctor tells you to. Dietary retinol is linked to [osteoporosis](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/vitamin-a-and-your-bones) and can cause hypervitaminosis a, while plant carotenes never do, because excess intake is harmlessly deposited in skin cells. \n\nNAD, NR, and precursors - the anti-aging hype on these was way overboard imo, they don’t look nearly as impressive in more recent research and the effective formulations are very expensive. Not worth it to me\n\nHyaluronic acid and plant ceramides - I thought both were a gimmick til I saw Paula’s choice is selling a HA/ceramide supplement. I’m trying a cheaper HA right now to see if it works and have been taking it for about 3 weeks. I have dry skin but it breaks out from heavy ingredients and oils so keeping it moist in the winter is a struggle. If supplements help I will gladly take them. I haven’t noticed my skin feeling different yet but I do think my face is more resilient to otc retinol in the past few weeks because I’ve been able to increase mine to daily. \n\nOn the plant ceramides, I think they’re intriguing and I might consider them but I also think there’s some risk there. While ceramides are uncontroversially good for topical skincare, inside the body they are [linked](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31502201/) \nto detrimental processes related to [diabetes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23835113/) and heart disease among other things. It’s possible that supplemental ceramides act differently from the ceramides we make ourselves, but I don’t know of any research on them other than the skin-related studies. Its also possible that dietary plant ceramides act differently from dietary animal ceramides but that also needs to be researched.",

    "body": "AKA: My Journey to Cutting Out Silicones\n\n**Burt's Bees Anti-blemish Solutions Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis moisturizer is available in drugstores. I got mine at Walmart. It costs about $25 CAD for 55g. I call this price range ‘drugstore bougie’, basically not expensive in general but pricey for a drug store product. Nonetheless, you can find it pretty widely and also online with no problems.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is definitely nice. It comes in a box. And when you pull it out, it's a heavy (glass, I believe) bottle with a cap over the pump. It looks good on a shelf. It has a moderate smell. It's definitely a good, slightly sweet smell.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely a heavier moisturizer. Iffy ‘cause it's advertised as lightweight. One pump adequately covers my face and neck with no problem. It's a little sticky for a while but it did provide moisture. My skin was soft but it itched and broke out in CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nOnce I got into skincare, I took another look at the ingredients here. The moisturizer has salicylic acid at 1% which is the acne-fighting ingredient. For hydration/moisture, I see glycerin. Then it has a lot of plant oils and extracts including sunflower seed oil, willow bark extract, lemongrass extract, hops extract, horsetail leaf extract, goldenseal extract, gravel willow extract and carrageenan extract. These can all be irritating. It also contains fragrance and witch hazel water. I wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty-free and uses mostly natural ingredients.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAlthough not for me, this might be a product that works for you if you have tolerant skin that needs a little boost in the form of a product that moisturizes well and offers some anti-acne properties. No matter your skin type and concerns, there's probably something better out there for you.\n\n2/5\n\n**Neutrogena Oil-free Moisture for Combination Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThis is also a drugstore product widely available. I got mine at Walmart for $14 CAD. I have also seen it at other drug stores and online. This is one you probably won't have trouble finding. They also make variations for different skin types.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nIts packaging is simple. It's a sleek white design. It has the type of pump that twists, so you can control the amount that flows out. There's no cap but you can lock the pump with the twisting. It's hardy plastic that holds up well even though I really tossed it around. It sid stain a little from my foundation (I would mix the two on occasion).\n\nApplication\n\nIt applies as a gel cream. It feels light and thin. Maybe too thin. It dries down matte even if you mix in oils and mattifies if you layer oils on top. It made my skin tight, which was my first sign I shouldn't have used this product continually. But of course I kept using it anyway due to its ingredient list, then started experiencing itchiness and CCs.\n\nIngredients\n\nHonestly, the ingredients look pretty good. For moisture/hydration, I'm seeing glycerin. It's fairly simple and the only thing that is a concern for some is the presence of silicones. Little did I know… \n\nOther\n\nThis product is neither cruelty free nor natural.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nHonestly, I think this is a good moisturizer. I like that it's mattifying. I think it would be great for oily skin and combo skin that leaned further towards oily. My skin is dehydrated and leaning towards dry, so it makes sense it wasn't enough moisture for me. The silicones won't bother most people and it's a good no-frills moisturizer.\n\n2/5 for me, 4/5 for the better-suited consumer\n\n**Equate Soft Moisturizing Cream**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Equate brand is Walmart's generic. This product is a dupe for Nivea soft moisturizing cream. You can get this in physical walmart locations or online through the walmart site. It's very affordable at $6 CAD for 200ml.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is simple and white. The product is in a tub. It's a really thick cream so this is best and I don't really have complaints.\n\nApplication\n\nIt goes on thick and heavy. I didn't like the way it felt, except that it stayed cold in my bathroom and felt refreshing. I experienced a negative reaction very quickly with this one. I was itchy right away. I used it at night and woke up in the morning with itchy red hives on one cheek. I had a job interview that morning… fun. I also experienced my existing CCs becoming red and inflamed with use of this product near it.\n\nIngredients\n\nLooking at the ingredients, I wanted to kick myself. For hydration/moisture, the product has glycerin, paraffinum liquidum, jojoba oil and lanolin alcohol. I had thought that fragrance was the only irritant and sometimes I can get away with that low on the ingredients list. But I found myristyl alcohols and myristyl myristate are commonly irritating and potentially comedogenic. This moisturizer also has silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis brand's cruelty-free status is unknown. They seem to say they don't test on animals.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI don't like this even on my body, which is extra dry. I just hate it. It's too heavy and too irritating for me. Honestly wouldn't recommend unless you really need a heavy night cream and are okay with the ingredients mentioned above. I thought it would help my winter skin. It didn't.\n\n1/5 for me, maybe 2.5/5 for others\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nThe Ordinary is very affordable. This moisturizer costs $5.80 CAD for 30ml or $7.70 CAD for 100ml. It's available online and at Deciem stores and I believe online-only at Sephora. Shipping is very reasonable.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is really cute. It comes in a white plastic tube coated in silver. It's a simple design that's nice to look at.\n\nApplication\n\nI love that this product is so versatile with how you can apply it. A little goes a long way if you want it to. I layer this stuff on, starting with a coat on wet skin and ending with a layer of the moisturizer mixed with rosehip oil. It sinks in so quickly. It leaves me feeling moisturized but not too shiny or greasy. I love the texture of this. A thick cream that applies thin, basically.\n\nIngredients\n\nThis product contains a lot of barrier-restoring essentials by focusing on the natural moisturizing factors our skin creates on its own. You see glycerin, hyaluronic acid, amino acids, allantoin, linoleic and oleic acids.There are no common irritants, fragrances, essential oils, or silicones.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is cruelty free\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI love this stuff. It's so versatile. It holds up to wear alone if your skin is really oily and can be layered very well if your skin is really dry. I recommend this especially if you have sensitive skin and are looking for something ‘safe’ for your skin. This is a good place to start. I think it will work out for most.\n\n5/5\n\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Cream for Extra Dry Skin**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nAnother drugstore bougie, this product is $20-25 CAD for 47ml. It's available most everywhere though. I bought mine on Amazon at $2 off, so I paid $18.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nThe packaging is lovely. It's a heavy tub in blue with a white lid. It is just really cute. It looks like it contains more than it does. A little bit of wasted material at the base.\n\nApplication\n\nI applied this on wet skin right out of the shower. I followed up with The Ordinary NMF and rosehip oil. I liked the way it felt at first. It was cool and light. Within 3 uses, I was breaking out, itchy, and getting little CCs in new places. All of my previous breakouts got so much more inflamed and swollen. This reaction led me to a comparison spree between a lot of products that broke me out, looking for the most likely culprits. And now I'm thinking silicones.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look fine. It has glycerin and hyaluronic acid for hydration. It's fragrance-free and doesn't have any common irritants to my knowledge. The ingredient list is fairly simple. It's really *just* silicones for me. And there are a lot of them.\n\nOther\n\nThis product is not cruelty-free.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI wish I could love this but it didn't love me. So I have to find something similar because it feels good. I would recommend this if you're not sensitive to silicones and are struggling with moisture retention, dryness, or damaged moisture barriers.\n\n1.5/5 for me, maybe 4/5 for others\n\n**Indeed Laboratories Hydraluron Moisture Jelly**\n\nPrice & Availability\n\nYet another drugstore bougie racking up at $25 CAD for 30ml. Why yes, it's tiny. Hopefully it lasts a while. I got mine at Shoppers Drug Mart. I believe they're a Canadian brand. I haven't seen them online (other than at their own site) but I think it's available to North America as a whole and probably internationally.\n\nPackaging & First Impressions\n\nI was really impressed by the packaging on this one. It's really cute, like *seriously* cute. And it has a pump?! Honestly was psyched to see this on a gel product rather than a tub  or squeeze tube. I prefer it for portioning and reduced waste. I believe it’s an airless pump. Which is good because I want every cent of this product on my face. The product is not open to the air and comes out through pin-sized holes. You don't even need a whole pump.\n\nApplication\n\nThis is definitely more of a true gel than the Neutrogena and it's cool, light, and refreshing. It leaves no stickiness as it dries (I apply on wet skin). And it layers perfectly under other moisturizers, absorbing right into my skin. Even in trouble spots. I use a small amount, about half a pump. I think it's really great.\n\nIngredients\n\nThe ingredients look good here. For hydration, I see glycerin, urea, and hyaluronic acid. There are no fragrances, essential oils, irritants or silicones. Very simple ingredient list. Also, if you look at the Indeed Laboratories site, it will show you the function of each ingredient when you hover.\n\nOther\n\nThis is a cruelty free product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is a recent addition to my routine, but I am loving it. I am so happy to use this. In only a few days of using this (+TO rosehip oil and natural moisturizing factors), I can already see my skin clearing up. I have great hopes for continued use of this.",

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Earth Rhythm Phyto Gel review.\n\nKey ingredients- centella asiatica & horsetail extract\n\nPrice - Rs 785 for 50ml\n\nSkin type - extremely oily and dehydrated\n\nAge & place- 22(F), hot and humid place\n\nUsage - in the morning after toning and before moisturiser. And after shaving my face.\n\nI have been trying this product for about 3 months and was waiting to make a proper opinion on this. \nSo as the name suggests, the product has a gel consistency and has no fragrance. I have used almost 80% of it and boy I am disappointed. \nSo the main reason why I bought this product because it looked promising and the consistency sold me. As I have oily skin, I love gel anything. My skin literally eats anything gel based.\nSo, the reason why I am so disappointed is that this product did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me. Like nada shunya changes in my skin. It did hydrate my skin ever so slightly but other than that nothing. I am not joking when I say that the aloe vera gel from the face shop does the same but for less of the price(I love that product tho). I even took a step of not using it for a week just to see if my skin misses it or not( I do this alot when I am confused about a product) and guess what, my skin did not miss it at all. I, actually, didn't use it for 9 days because I literally forgot about it. \nI do have to give ER props for good packaging. I love the packaging of this product. It looks cute and came in a vv cute box. It's better than what most indian brands give in terms of packaging. BUT packaging doesn't do anything for skin.\n\nI was honestly rooting for this product because ER as a brand looks promising (I know some people in this sub are sceptical about ER) but now I don't know. I have their SPF also but again very sceptical about it too.\n\nThis Phyto Gel is a WNRP for me. I won't be buying a gel that slightly hydrates my skin while giving me nothing else.",

    "body": "I requested COA's for four different supplements I ordered on bulksupplements a few weeks ago after seeing others concerned about the supposedly \"clean and pure\" supplement distributor. They responded hours later with the results.\n\n~~To be honest they seem pretty bad and the data sits on the federally mandated maximum. It also concerns me that the values for the heavy metals are the same for all four supplements I requested COA's for- this makes me thing that the \"in  house testing\" they do is fraudulent.~~  As mentioned by u/switbiskit, I left out the NMT before each value of the heavy metal. I still feel iffy about the values because I have seen COA request from other websites stating (no more than) NMT 3PPM for Pb, etc. As someone mentioned they seem to be going for the cheapest testing option without releasing the actual tested amount.\n\nI would just like to hear the opinions of people here- especially from those with a health/chemistry background or background in the supplement industry. How much would these quantities of heavy metals and microbes affect me when consuming anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon of these supplements on a daily basis.\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Item|Pb|Cd|As|Hg|Yeast/Mold|Total Plate Count|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Horsetail Extract|5PPM|1PPM|5PPM|0.2PPM|1,000cfu/g|10,000cfu/g|\n|Schisandra|5PPM|1PPM|5PPM|0.2PPM|100cfu/g|5,000cfu/g|\n|N-Acetyl L-Cystein (NAC)|5PPM|1PPM|5PPM|0.2PPM|1,000cfu/g|10,000cfu/g|\n|DMAE (bitartrate)|5PPM|1PPM|5PPM|0.2PPM|1,000cfu/g|10,000cfu/g|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concern now is about the microbe count. 10,000CFU/gram sounds sketchy to me.",

        "body": "Good thinking requesting a COA, thats a great way of shopping for supplements.  This isn't a COA at all, it's simply the micro and heavy metal specs for the ingredients.  You'd want to ask them how they test identity in the Horsetail and Schisandra, and whether they test potency of each ingredient, and again in the finished formulation (as is required by law).  Also on those herbs, how about pesticides, residual solvents?  Quality supplements can be expensive but groups that call this a COA are not likely putting effort into it at all.  Absolute cheapest means possible is generally how these are done.",

If you would like to create a larger or smaller batch, or convert it into a different measurement, use this batch calculator\n\n\nLets break down the role these ingredients play. In the heated phase, we are using a fairly large % of water. This hydrates the hair, as well as keeping the product light and fast absorbing. As our emulsifier we are using BTMS 50 for it’s cationic properties – this means it is positively charged so it will adhere to your hair better. We’ve used two hydrosols here, chamomile for it’s soothing capacity and orange blossom to reduce sebum build up. Oliv-esters and oat proteins act as light film formers, hydrating and softening the hair.    \nFor the cool down phase we are adding polyquat 7. This is also a cationic ingredient, contributing to the conditioning properties of the final product. We have a small amount of jojoba oil and oliv-silicone as hydrating additions; and lastly, some horsetail extract to prevent split ends.    \nTo fragrance, I used Brambleberry’s Moonlight Pomegranate which brings to mind a decadent, feminine, hair product line.\n\n\n**Directions:**\n\n    \n1. Prepare and sanitize your area.    \n2. Measure your heated phase into a pyrex dish (or a similarl heat proof bowl). Add an additional 10% to the water phase (10g if you are making a 100g batch) to account for evaporation. Weigh the water phase and bowl and minus the 10% water addition. This number is the optimum number you want your water phase to be at when it is removed from the heat.    \n3. Creating a water bath, melt your heated phase. Cover the water phase to minimize evaporation. To ensure sterilization, you can heat up to 75 degrees celsius and hold for two minutes.    \n4. Once the heated phase is fully melted and combined, remove from the heat. Weigh the heated phase again, and add any additional water if required.    \n5. Use a stick blender (or a hand whisk if you are careful) to ensure the heated phase is fully combined.    \n6. To finish, add the cool down ingredients once the temperature reaches 50 degrees Celsius or under, blending them in with the stick blender to combine.    \n7. Funnel or spoon into the container of your choice.    ",

I won't list the product here. (No changes in his medications)I'm listing the product ingredients and want to know what could possibly the reason for actual hairgrowth from people who know it better. There seems to be no Minox in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"Skrzypovita Serum Pro\", because of all the downvotes here you have it holy xd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story is below the Ingredients. It's the same Ingredient order as on the package.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Arginine, Lactic Acid, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lamium Album Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Pinus Sylvestris Bud Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Citrus Limon Peel Extract, Hedera Helix Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tropaeolum Majus Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Actinidia Chinensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Biotin, Glycoproteins, Ethoxydiglycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCI, Panthenol, Zinc Chloride, Acetyl Cysteine, Glutamine, Methionine, Saccharomyces Lysate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylalycerin. Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate\n\nSo my Dad is 90% bald on the top with little small hair in the crownarea and some on the front between the temples. Huge donorarea tho. He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

It is well-known for two reasons: history and price It's a really big name brand with a history, and **a price** point several times higher than many premium brands. In February, they released a new product **priced at $1,980**!!! Which is very expensive for 24 ml.  \n⠀  \n**So, what's inside**? I reached out to La Prairie for the full list of ingredients in this cocktail. They kindly answered and sent the full list (I'll put it at the end)\n\nThis is a quite impressive cocktail. I was initially skeptical about it, as I am about most highly-priced products. It is clear from the ads how much money and effort is invested in the product.  \n⠀  \nAs promised by the manufacturer, the product contains *a special mixture* of a couple of glycoproteins derived from yeast and *Lactobacillus*, *ginseng*, and *horsetail extracts*. It can be found in many La Prairie products. The distinctive component is *colloidal platinum*, and what’s even more interesting is the *mixture of growth factors* of plant origin. Plus, there’s a mixture of moisturizing ingredients (*amino acids, minerals, saccharides*). This is what a good anti-aging serum should look like.\n\nEven though the composition may look amazing, don’t let appearances be deceptive. The base of the composition is growth factors (plant) and good old Matrixil, and there are other cocktails containing this type of base which are as efficient, and much cheaper.\n\nLooking at the packaging of the product, it looks as if it’s worth even more than the 24ml product itself! \n\nI wouldn’t mind having this cocktail in my routine, but not at this price.

Thats $200 a month for a product that is backed by countless studies and is still 1/10 of what you would pay at an antiaging clinic. Its very easy to find. If you can't afford that then spend $50 a month on injectable ipamorelin and sermorelin which is basically poor man's HGH. Anti aging clinics carry both of these but you will pay $250 min per month.",

    "body": "This review is for the orange bottle! Just received my purchase a couple weeks ago and so far so good! I'm Filipino with medium brown skin, acne-prone combination skin, and Fitzpatrick Type IV. I'm also undergoing laser treatment for acne/hyperpigmentation, so sunscreen is a MUST. Biore Watery Essence is my HG sunscreen, but I was looking for something that was water/sweat-proof for the beach and working out. Found this on Ratzilla's new release list for 2018 and subsequently purchased it on ebay. SUNCUT's sunscreen is oil, sweat, and water resistant. Unfortunately, that was before I saw the threads about the dangers of non-reef-safe sunscreens, so I'm still on the look out for a suncreen for beach days that doesn't turn me into a ghost, AND doesn't contain Oxybenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, PABA (Aminobenzoic Acid), enzacamene, octisalate, homosalate, or avobenzone. Let me know if you've found one!\n\nAs far as this sunscreen goes, no white cast! I like that it's kind of like an unscented version of Biore Watery Essence. The texture is very similar, though it leaves my face with a very slight tacky feeling. After it's sunken in a little, it's not noticeable to me at all. Presumably, this is from the alcohol content, which doesn't bother me personally. But beware if you are sensitive to it. I've only used this on days that I expect to sweat, so I'm unsure how it would perform under makeup, but Ratzilla says that it's supposed to act as a makeup base. They also state that it features a new Suncut serum \"Allerguard\" that supposedly prevents environmental particles, like pollen and dust, from clinging to your skin. But who knows how true that can be. It's reasonably priced, at least for my budget; I purchased the 110g bottle for $21.99. Overall I'd rate it 9/10. But obviously, YMMV.\n\n* SPF: 50+\n* PA++++\n* UV Filters: Octinoxate, Parsol SLX, Uvinul A Plus, & Tinosorb S.\n* Ingredients: Water, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, alcohol, isododecane, polysilicone-15, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, silica, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, clematis vitalba leaf extract, spiraea ulmaria flower extract, equisetum arvense extract, hypericum perforatum flower/leaf/stem extract, hedera helix (ivy) extract, calendula officinalis flower extract, sodium hyaluronate, tilia cordata flower extract, centaurea cyanus flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract, phaeophyta extract, soluble collagen, butylene glycol, BHT, dipropylene glycol, PEG-10 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, xanthan gum, glycerin, propylene glycol dicaprate, silica dimethyl silylate, behenyl alcohol, polyethylene, polyhydroxystearic acid, potassium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben\n\nSources:\n1.

    "body": "So I asked some questions about nail care few days ago in this sub and carried more research meanwhile so I thought I would share what I found with everyone in case somebody wondered about the same things :)\n\n**This only my honest understanding of those few points from various readings. I haven't had bio or chemistry classes since highschool!** \n\nPlease correct me on any inaccuracy :)\n\n**Cuticle oil**\n\n* *Is* ***jojoba oil*** *really superior to others? I've also read about coconut, castor oil and even camellia oil, how do they all compare if you have tried many?*\n\nJojoba oil is supposedly superior to other oils because it would be the only oil being able to penetrate the nail plate. Now, I could not find any proof of that anywhere. The same belief can be read about jojoba oil being the only one able to penetrate the skin which has been proven [wrong](https://atlasofscience.org/oil-penetration-into-the-human-skin/). Of course, nails and skin have a different structure so maybe it is still true for nail.\n\nAs for hair, which is made of keratin cells too (but different structure from nails!), coconut has been found to reduce protein loss (understand: reduce damage and breakage) [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/). Still comparing to hair, camellia and castor oils are traditionally used to strengthen hair, so why would it not work for nails? I've read positive reviews about them for growing healthier nails.\n\nWhat seems to matter for sure though is the viscosity of the oil: the most viscous oils take more time to penetrate the nail structure but they also stay longer (see [here](http://www.nailcarehq.com/nail-care-how-to-strengthen-brittle-nails/) for inception quotation). Generally speaking, oils are less viscous when they are warmer. If anything, jojoba and coconut oils have a similar molecular weight which allows for an easier penetration of nail bed. FYI, olive oil has a lower molecular weight than them.\n\nAlso, the key for an oil to go through the nail plate is for it to be left in contact as long as possible without interuption.\n\n**TL;DR:** I don't know but any oil of choice could have its interest. Any oil would help preventing dehydration of the nail which is key.\n\n(Castor oil is a pain to use though because it's super viscous.)\n\nHere is a good [article](http://www.casualcontrast.com/2013/07/the-lacquerologist-tells-all-eponychium.html) that explains nail structure (I discovered it through google, no add whatsoever)\n\n\n* *What's the deal with* ***vitamin E*** *and why is it important for nails?*\n\nVitamin E is an antioxydant. It's generally good because it prevents cells from being damaged during oxydation process that occurs naturally. Since it protects from oxydation, it also helps preserving the oil it's mixed with.\n\nAlso, a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2064401) pointed to the possibility of vitamin E increasing nail growth rate and fighting yellow nail syndrom.\n\nFYI: if you are a geek and I haven't lost you yet, seems like horsetail extract can [improve nail structure and appearance](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adele_Sparavigna/publication/258027706_Equisetum_arvense_in_a_new_transungual_technology_imporves_nail_structure_and_appearance/links/00b49526a4ea7edf2e000000/Equisetum-arvense-in-a-new-transungual-technology-imporves-nail-structure-and-appearance.pdf).\n\n**Strengtheners**:\n\n* *I'm super confused about the discovery that strengteners can actually make nails break even more.*\n\n=> [Link to the reference](http://loodieloodieloodie.blogspot.ca/2010/11/nail-hardeners-1-of-7.html) on why streghteners can make things worse.\n\n* *What would cause* ***slits on the side of nails***, *sometimes quite low in the nail bed, lack of strength or lack of moisture?*\n\nMost likely lack of moisture.\n\nIf it happens on natural nails: check your general health and make sure to use an oil and protect your nails from dehydration (ie. wearing polish and gloves).\n\nIf it happens after soak-off gel (that was my case): possible causes could be dehydration (if the nails were already dehydrated before the gel polish, and all the more after removing it with acetone), not restoring moisture by using oils/creams, leaving the gel for too long too. For the last one, that could result in dehydration, harder to remove (longer time in acetone required) and also offering more opportunities for breakage since the nails are long and hard at the tip. Physically, what happens during a shock is that the free edge cannot bend because of the gel, so the (dehydrated brittle) nail will break where it offers the least resistance: at the base of the free edge on the sides.\n\n\n* *Even people saying strenghteners are bad say to use a* ***clear polish*** / *base coat not to leave the nails \"naked\". Which one is your favorite for wearing alone and not as a base under color polish?*\n\nFrom what I got (mainly from [this video](https://youtu.be/9Mn-5pWLErg) that has been recommended and is a gold mine of info), any base coat would do the trick.\nI suppose it would be better to avoid those containing strengthening ingredients like formaldehyde though.\nMost popular base coats on this sub seems to be CND stickey base, Orly bonder and Julep oxygen base coat. OPI nail envy and CND toughen up are mentioned too but they double up as strengtheners.\n\nApparently you can also just wear a clear topcoat but I'm not sure it's the best idea since top coat is made to adhere to nail polish while base coat is made to adhere to nail.\n\n**Shaping**:\n\n* *What shape is* ***best to avoid breakage***, *square or oval?*\n\nSquare is supposed to present a larger surface to absorbe shock, but it also offer corners that can snap. On this sub it seems like round is the handy shape that allows people to grow longer nails without breaking. A good compromise is squoval (square with rounded edges).\n\n* *Why is it bad to use a* ***nail clipper?*** \n\nUsing a clipper puts trauma on the nail and can result in splitting the nail further than planned.\n\n* *If buffing is bad because it thins nails, is there another way to smooth the nail surface/minimize* ***ridges?*** \n\nRidges are a sign of unhealthy nails. Taking care of your nails (with oil mainly) lead to healthier nails, so less ridges. (But it takes time)\n\nMeanwhile, a ridge filling basecoat will help with the appearance. [Source](http://www.nailcarehq.com/ridges-in-nails-to-buff-or-not-to-buff/)\n\n* *Is there any trick to get a* ***longer nail bed*** / *shorter free edge in proportions?*\n\nYes and no.\n\nYes: stop biting your nails, clean underneath your nails gently with a brush ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/4venhu/my_nail_beds_are_really_short_is_there_any_way_to/)), grow longer nails in general (I've read on some forum that the nail would drag the attached skin as it grows overtime). It takes time, like years.\n\nNo: part of it is from genetics.\n",

        "body": "It looks like a somewhat gentle cleanser, but I don't think this shampoo will help much with dandruff.  The herbs included aren't particularly antifungal, and dandruff is often caused by fungal overgrowth.  If you want a gentle, natural shampoo that's going to help fight dandruff, you might try the [Faith in Nature rosemary shampoo](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/product/faith-in-nature-rosemary-shampoo-60019691), or a tea tree oil shampoo like [Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Giovanni-Cosmetics-Triple-Invigorating-Conditioner/dp/B0011UVCKU/ref=sr_1_15_sspa?crid=BD3ZMNERYDBT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pm4KXp9UQKtRLRg9wTgATx_Gl-us353mbx7opTGWVJOAdSL-n8Lmd4voFuXt7PeQhWjp3_fseu2wUJm3RfQeDa3nQ_s1DWfGZxperZU2eIwAaLLBTHPy8XoFaINn2sxjBdmzPswkcr6wqB95MXD0oThIK_YS25GnnZS6KB4tBAZPsL_mSPbMRVeSbwyuLrPeENIPU20bYwEjqfOw9zorRYESQK3hgPqu3w0eaVxJmgfyejQxGxqzX_YuUWsB7Zk-R1EYfsphZL47gj_E5XHCOW_YodHK9fBa-AVtD_hUUYc.KdqC32l0HqTX4rFNB9ysF8fTZuphx1zBl8-ni7pDWsY&dib_tag=se&keywords=giovanni+tea+tree+shampoo&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1729591824&refresh=1&sprefix=giovanni+tea+tree%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-15-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&psc=1).  (I'm using UK amazon links as I'm assuming that you're in the UK because of the Holland & Barrett link.) You would need to moisturize your hair after shampooing somehow; there is a section in the wiki of this sub for natural moisturizers.  I don't recommend diluting the shampoo to minimize the drying effect, because then you'd also be diluting the concentration of the herbs which can help fight the dandruff.  Another option is to try co-washing with a tea tree oil conditioner instead; the Giovanni tea tree oil conditioner is a great option for this.  It wouldn't dry out the hair and you'd get the same benefit of the antifungal herbs.  Co-washing involves applying conditioner as if it's shampoo, massaging it really well into the scalp and hair, which can help break up some of the oil and buildup because conditioners have gentle cleansing agents in them as well, and oils can break down other oils.\n\nDo you do any mechanical cleaning to maintain the scalp, or are you just rinsing your hair with water?  If you don't currently do mechanical cleaning, it's an important aspect of scalp care in No Poo hair washing.  There is an article linked in the side column on Water Only washing that explains what's involved for mechanical cleaning.",

Nizoral will probably dry out your scalp but dandruff means fungal overgrowth and fungus loves moisture. If rhe dryness becomes unbearable try using less + if you have medium-long hair you can still condition the ends. The only home remedies I know for the fungus that causes this is salt water and apple cider vinegar but never tried them because most home remedies I've tried have been BS. Might also be worth looking at your lifestyle and diet and see if you've changed anything as dandruff can be triggered by other health conditions or life changes e.g. mine was triggered by a hormonal treatment but went away when I stopped. Then I got it SO bad when I was vaping daily that it even spread to my face and I had to use canesten cream on my face twice a day (my hypothesis is because vape juices usually contain sugar alcohol sweeteners and fungus likes sugar but im not a scientist so who knows lol) but again after a week of quitting all the dandruff was gone",

    "body": "I have written things on my own transition/hair blog and posted one on here and I got good feedback so here is another. Some of the temporal references refer to other blog entries if they don't make sense. This is largely written off the top of my head, so to speak so anyone who disagrees, please chime in. That's how we all master this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond the foibles of transgender females being taken advantage of  regarding  non-hormonal breast growth, we have another type of products  that tend not to work at all, salon hair products, special shampoos and  hair supplements. Except for conditioning hair, none of these salon  products work at all for anyone who doesn't have a severe nutritional  deficiency.   \n \n\nOften, if not  always, the \"organic\" substitutes cost far more than real estrogen;  accordingly these pseudo-hair products are often very expensive.  \n \n\nBack  in the olden days before minoxidil, one used to see exactly the same products advertised by health food chains, promoting useless treatments for male pattern baldness that usually were very expensive and  if they worked at all, it was due to the massaging needed to work them  into the scalp. Massaging water into the scalp would have worked just as  well. Massaging for both men and women can have tiny results but is highly unlikely to be cosmetically significant.  \n \n\nBut now it appears to be the cis-females who already got all the good hair, lol, getting  snookered, and not just cis-males and transgender females.   \n \n\nMany  good-natured cis-female acquaintances of mine keep touting biotin to me and I nod and thank  them politely but that is one of the supplements that have been around forever  touted to \"regrow\" hair back in 1983 and even before. Biotin is no secret.  \n \n\nBiotin may promote healthy nails  but it doesn't grow hair or stop hair loss except for possibly people  malnourished to the point of starvation. Biotin was the first thing that  I used at age 20 and it did nothing, and the second thing that I added  were B vitamins and they did nothing. These supplements won't hurt anyone unless  taken in huge quantities but they won't improve hair.  \n \n\nIn  the absence of hormonal manipulation, and that can still be difficult and can take a long, long time, even when  using estrogen and T-blockers, hair is absolutely in my experience is the  hardest cosmetic attribute to change, i.e. improve, for both males and females.  \n \n\nAnd it gets worse.  \n \n\nNot  only is not possible to regrow hair with these products except the one  containing minoxidil, and not only do none of these products even slow  hair loss in any visible way, but even aside from their having zero  effects on growth or hair loss:  \n \n\nThere are no non-hormonal products that even improve hair in terms of  sheen, length, consistency, brittleness, smoothness or any of the other  aspects that we find so fetching in the hair of certain lucky  cis-females except for dandruff shampoos, and they too operate similarly  to Nizoral by reducing fungi in the scalp.   \n \n\nBeautiful hair is largely genetics and gender-based, and the other  significant aspect is age-related.  \n \n\nHere is a site that is really an extended advertisement that claims that  they know14 things (actually) effective for hair regrowth:  https://www.whowhatwear.com/best-hair-growth-products/slide11  \n \n\nThis page seems to come up a lot when I research products that simply do  not work and that are a waste of money for everyone, males, females and  transgender individuals of all stripes.   \n \n\nTo rip off the old song, \"To all the woman, I've loved before\", I sing  instead, \"to all the baldness cures I've tried before....\" If I am  emphatic, it is because I have wasted hundreds and hundreds of dollars  on such \"hair growth\" products. I am with you, not against you.   \n \n\nLet's see, then.  \n \n\nHere's one of our  big 14 products:  \n \n\nBiotin Shampoo Hair Growth B-Complex Formula: \"Love  this! I have thinning hair due to genetics;  huge amount of hair fall. Since using this shampoo, the hair fall has  significantly decreased and I can feel stubblies (is that a word?) on  top of my head,\" a reviewer named Carol says.  \n \n\nI assume  that stubblies is intended to mean new little hairs growing in, but  until using spiro last summer, I have never seen any sort baby hairs coming in at my hairline even  when when using the legitimate previously-mentioned products that have  been double-blind tested that work to stop hair loss for cis-males.  \n \n\nSorry, I am rooting for you, but no you don't see stubble, not from Biotin shampoo or B vitamins.   \n \n\nHere's  another one with someone touting hair vitamins. Such supplements come up again and again and they are nothing new:  \n \n\n\"My hair was falling out in clumps  and getting super thin in the front,\" explained one reviewer Cyferguson.  On the recommendation of my hairstylist, I ordered these vitamin  gummies and  now have tons of new hair growth. I'm so pleased\".  \n \n\nIf this is true, this woman just needed to eat because unless she was in  a starvation state, sorry, no you do not see tons of new hair growth  from vitamins. Before anything, she should have been in the  dermatologist's office instead of sourcing gummy vitamins from her  stylist.  \n \n\nHere someone touts another type of hair vitamins:  \n \n\n\"I started to see a difference in as little as 2 weeks!\" exclaims  Antoinette Castillo on Amazon. \"My hair was no longer falling out as  much in the shower, and I began to see baby hairs growing in where my  hair was thinning. I'm glad to have found a product that actually works.  Even other people are noticing that my hair is growing back which  definitely gives me a confidence boost.\"  \n \n\nSame thing, unless this person was suffering from serious malnutrition,  there was no regrowth. I used to trick myself into thinking I saw things  as well by using multiple angles and different types of lighting. What  she likely sees are non-pigmented non-growing vellus hairs. I know. I  know. The truth hurts.  \n \n\nYet again, here is someone else touting yet another vitamin formulation  with biotin: \"I finished my first bottle, and I'm ordering another one!\"  satisfied reviewer KristinaM confesses. \"The most noticeable effect I  noticed during the first month is not the hair *growth* but the reduction of hair loss. I lose about half the hair I used to lose in the shower since taking Hairfluence.\" Yeah, right.  \n \n\nBelow  this \"ad\", there is a picture of Jennifer Anniston but I am not sure  why, Ms. Anniston does have great amazing but it doesn't come from popping vitamins.  \n \n\nAnd another:  \n \n\nCombining pivotal ingredients like a whopping  5000 MCG of biotin in addition to helpful side hustlers like vitamin C  and other B vitamins, these coated caplets from Nature's Bounty are a  slam dunk for expedited hair growth says the article.\"I have Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,\" one Amazon reviewer disclosed.  \"Because of this disease, I have some hair loss, plus, thanks to all  the biologic drugs I have to take, I had massive bald spots. My hair was  falling out in the handfuls, so I was referred by a friend to take  these vitamins. I started taking them and within 2 months had lots of  new growth in my bald spots. I have continued to take the vitamins and  my hair is full and beautiful.\" \n\nUnless this person was literally in a state of starvation from her  ailment or suffered instead from alopecia areata, that's just crap.  Alopecia areata often does clear up spontaneously but I have only met  two person my entire life suffering from this type of baldness which  often involves patchy hair loss not thinning hair loss. If someone's  hair is falling out in clumps, they need to go see a dermatologist right  away.  \n \n\nI know whereof I speak. My hair actually did come out in clumps last  summer and it was due to estrogenic hormonal influences. I have  pictures. One should either see a dermatologist or an endocrinologist  like I do.   \n \n\nSome women do experience highly concerning diffuse thinning but guess  what is most likely to help: substances that manipulate hormones.  Spironolactone is widely prescribed for cis-females when this happens  and I am convinced that such diffuse thinning does respond to  hormone-altering medications like spiro. It is right there in the  medical literature.\n\nNow here's a product at least mentioning something that could actually work in the right context.  \n \n\nIt's called Propidren by HairGenics DHT Blocker & Hair Growth Supplement                                          ($40) and the person touting it says: \"I am a breast  cancer survivor in remission. I am thrilled to add this  to my regimen for the regrowth of my hair. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS  WORKING FORMULA! Glad to see my results,\" says Amazon reviewer Crystal  Ly.\n\nSo DHT inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride are DHT-blockers  but when I look at the ingredients of Propidren, they are just the same  useless things touted to \"treat\" male pattern baldness forever, thrown  together in hopes of achieving synergy:   \n \n\n Ingredients.  Biotin, Zinc, Iron, Saw Palmetto, Beta-Sitosterol, Horsetail Extract,  Fo-tu, Pygeum Bark Powder, Green Tea Extract.   \n \n\nBeen there done this.   \n \n\nSeveral  of the above ingredients are claimed to cause feminization akin to  Estroven while saw palmetto and pygeum bark theoretically could work  because they are a bit like finasteride and dutasteride in that they mop  up a tiny bit of DHT perhaps, but I have used them extensively and they  did nothing. Propidren purchases are wasted money especially when  cis-females have estrogen and t-blockers that they can take without side  effects, unlike males.  \n \n\n40 bucks for this? Rogaine monthly is much cheaper than $40.  \n   \n Remember our sad rule of thumb that applies to cis-males, cis-females and transgender individuals:  \n \n\nWith  respect to growing hair or stopping hair loss, the only treatment that  even remotely works without manipulating hormone levels in the body or  scalp is minoxidil, and it barely works even to prevent or even slow  hair loss if not used with medications that are androgen-blockers.  \n   \n It  makes absolutely no sense for any cis-females to use these 14 products.  Had I been able at age 19, I would have been taking both oral estrogen  and spiro but they refused to prescribe it for males and we didn't know  back then if temporary use of female hormones could interfere with male  procreative processes unduly. I would have taken small breasts in a  second, even presenting as male, over male pattern baldness but then  again, I am transgender so it's a chicken and egg thing, sort of.   \n   \n \n\nMoving on:  \n \n\nHere's a product geared towards taking advantage of black females:  \n \n\nThe Roots Naturelle Virgin Hair Fertilizer Conditioning Treatment                                          ($16)  \n \n\n\"Claims the blurb/ad, \"Any product that reads \"hair fertilizer\"  immediately piques our interest. Ideal for African American hair types,  this deep conditioner is meant to heal hair that's been damaged due to  braiding, heat, and chemicals. Essentially, it utilizes key power  players like proteins, vitamins, olive oil, shea butter, and oils from  peppermint and sweet almond to treat and restore weak and brittle  strands. Just look at the below happy review for proof.\n\n\"100%  works!! Warning, it does feel like an Icy-Hot on your scalp. The first  time it was kind of a shock, but it hasn't bothered me since, and it has  definitely helped my hair grow double what it normally would. I usually  use it every other day, and I'll leave it on for about five minutes in  the shower. It has definitely helped to heal the damage in my hair.\"  \n\nNope, not either although this ad is less misleading than others.  \n \n\nIn terms of breakage and frizziness, the races might be ordered Asians,  Native Americans, Whites and African-Americans. That doesn't mean any  sort of hair consistency is \"better\".  \n \n\nMoisturizing products might help excessive breakage but no product is  likely to hair grow double, even if only in reference to hair volume  merely through conditioning. This could possibly be a great conditioner  for blacks, but it isn't going to double the volume or anything even  close to that. Nor is this product any sort of hair fertilizer. Hair is  not grass and none of the listed ingredients do anything except to coat  the already existent hair shafts.   \n \n\nAnd wait a minute, what the heck does the \"virgin\" reference in the  product name mean? Does it restore virginal hair? And it is naturelle,  which must be lots better than natural.\n\nThen there's Easy Hair Growth Oil, now only $19:  \n \n\nIt contains castor oil, caffeine, rosemary oil, and biotin, purportedly to infuse both scalp and  strands with essential omega-6 fatty acids, minerals, proteins, and  vitamin E.  \n \n\nThese are just different things that men have been trying to regrow hair  or prevent baldness forever. All of these are referenced on the Perfect  Hair Forever site.  \n \n\nUnless someone has a nutritional deficiency, this is a conditioner and  nothing more except a bunch of different things thrown together that  balding males who refused to use finasteride or dutasteride hope will  work. They don't.  \n \n\n$19 dollars for a really good conditioner or hair treatment could be  worth it for some people but you can get several effective such products  at Amazon for about $8.\n\nReviewer Erin Graham on Amazon continues :\"when I find something that is exceptional, I have to rave about it.  I started using this oil about three weeks ago. Since then, I have been  religiously using it every night. I can tell the difference in the  health of my scalp. It feels nourished and healthy and it is evidenced  in the rapid growth of my hair. This is a definite keeper in my arsenal  of products for natural hair.\"  \n \n\nYeah, yeah. Theoretically caffeine might accelerate growth slightly but  it does not cause rapid regrowth in males. Possibly the female pathways  differ but just soak your head in coffee and save the bucks. The Perfect  Hair site discusses caffeine and it is a waste of time unless you  refuse to try spiro or estrogen.  \n \n\nI do agree with her. on one thing. When *I* find a treatment that  is exceptional, I try to tell all of my female friends about it. Try  Spiro! Try estrogen! Go get a prescription tomorrow or order Biestro  just to see.  \n \n\nEven if you are not balding, these hormonal medications might  substantially improve the quality of your hair, allowing it to grow  longer, thicker or shinier without breakage, sort of like Jennifer  Anniston's.  \n \n\nLook at all of the young cis-females and their pictures on google images  or youtube, say under 25 years old or even 30 years old. All of them  use estrogen and spiro and they tend to all have exceptional hair. Check  these pictures of transgender females before and after:  \n \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/transtimelines/  \n \n\nThings that impact hormonal levels are the only things that  regrow hair or that even stop hair loss or even improve hair for anyone,  male or female but I can't even get my sister to listen to me.  \n \n\nI fail to understand at all, the bias that some women have against  estrogen supplementation. Any dermatologist is going to hand you a  script for either estrogen or an anti-androgenic medication after five  minutes and then shoo you away unless there is something extremely rare  going on, like alopecia areata going on.  \n \n\nThere's not even any point in fretting about cis-female hair loss unless  and until said female tries spiro first! It should be automatic in  these situations just as it often is for teenage girls with acne.  Remember DHT causes all of these terrible afflictions like acne,  baldness, dermatitis, rashes sores and so on.  \n \n\nIt's rather cis-males who have to twiddle their thumbs and think before  using anti-androgens because except for dutasteride and finasteride, in  large enough quantities, every single thing that regrows hair makes  erections difficult or impossible, and impacts fertility and makes them  physically, much, much weaker if used to approximate cis-female hormonal  profiles.   \n \n\nOh well.   \n \n\nThen we come to Viviscal, which is the only one along with Keronique  even with a reputation for growing hair, meaning that I have heard of  this particular brand name. It is ultra-expensive and contains the  following ingredients: Amino Mar Marine Complex, Horsetail (Stem) Extract, Millet Seed Extract, *Vitamin C* (from Acerola Cherry and as *Ascorbic Acid*), Niacin (as Niacinamide), Biotin, Iron.  \n\nOnce again, this is just  a warmed over vitamin concoction plus Aminomar Marine Complex, which  appears to be nothing more than protein. They have a vegetarian version  that replaces the Marine Complex with Biotin. This one is a major, major  rip-off. Virtually all the articles that refer to it are advertisements  that link to each other in a looping fashion.\n\nThere are no  non-hormonal supplements that do anything to affect hair significantly,  either positively or negatively for either males or females. Otherwise, I  would be taking fist-fulls of any vitamins that worked. All of these  over-the-counter products intentionally mislead by saying something  like,\"studies indicate that hair growth isn't possible at all without  supplement X\", let's say Biotin. \n\nWhat they don't say is  that, what is logically and inevitably true is that no hair grows in the  complete absence of circulating biotin. But again, virtually everyone  already has more than enough of biotin circulating within them than is  necessary for hair growth. Just downing more biotin does zero. The same  goes for Vitamin C, niacin, keratin, iron and virtually every other  mineral--unless you are in a starvation state, additional vitamins and  minerals do nothing for hair at all.\n\nThe other thing is that  all of the above users are self-reporting which virtually always  involves the placebo effect or hoping against hope under a lighted  mirror which I am more than familiar with. For me, polysorbate 80 was  like this. None of the listed ingredients that I have seen work at all  except for saw palmetto, and dutasteride and finasteride are far, far  more effective than saw palmetto. \n\nI have used saw  palmetto. Theoretically it could have tiny effects to diminish DHT but  it won't regrow hair, just as neither dutasteride or finasteride regrow  hair. I reviewed a brand new review of double-blind studies last night  and all of the products I have previously mentioned, minoxild, Nizoral,  dutasteride, finasteride, i.e., products that do not induce  feminization, are unable to regrow hair. These products all do work,  however at stopping hair loss, at least a little. Start early with  them. \n\nOnly estrogen,  flutamide, spironolactone, cypreterone ,and other similar acting drugs  that bind to the androgen receptors regrow hair and even they might not  completely work for former cis-males in transtion.\n\nThe supplement-based  \"treatments\" don't prevent hair loss. They don't prevent frizzy hair.  They don't regrow hair. They don't make hair thicker.  Except for the  conditioning types that, well, condition the outside of the hair,  basically there are no effects good or bad.   \n \n\nI can't cut hair without  using a bowl but all of these products that claim that they are touted  by the best hair stylists--that is just fatuous. Under the \"ad/blurb\" the person touting Viviscal states: I've talked to scores of hairstylists who recommend Viviscal tablets.   \n \n\nOh really?   \n \n\nHave these hair stylists  examined the latest medical literature where double-blind statistically  significant testing has been done? Do hair stylists have special  training in statistical analysis? My rule of thumb is again never  purchase any hair products, particularly that cost more than $10 at a  cosmetic salon unless you just want to do so, sort of as a tip since the  stylist may get a cut of proceeds.   \n   \n Number 13 on our \"effective\" list of products that \"actually\" make hair grow reads:   \n \n\n\"I love and swear by countless products from Hum Nutrition (specifically Flatter Me, $25; Beauty Zzzz, $10; and Ripped Rooster,  $40), but these hair-boosting gummies are by far my fave, and I swear  on my life to anyone who will listen that they've completely transformed  my hair in the past year since I've started taking them. They taste  great (but I recommend eating them with food because they contain zinc),  and my hair has never looked so thick or grown so fast\".   \n \n\nThis sounds like rank  plagiarism from one of the products above. Just think, fellow  transgender females, all we need are vitamins to cover our balding areas  and completely transform our hair.   \n   \n Last and possibly least comes:   \n Nutrafol Core for Women                                          ($79):  \n \n\n\"By addressing multiple causes for thinning strands and poor hair health,  Nutrofol has basically designed the holy-grail hair supplement that  scientifically works to boost thickness, length, and overall hair  happiness. Powered by plants and a bounty of nature's best hair healers,  the impressive ingredient list includes things like ashwagandha, saw  palmetto, hydrolyzed collagen, tocotrienols (vitamin E), a special form  of curcumin extracted from turmeric, among other antioxidants, vitamins,  and minerals\".   \n \n\nAarggh! What the heck is  \"hair happiness?\" $79! I have tried French products with placenta  factors. Nutrafol has botanical factors and is \"powered by plants\". They  too have a phony study.  \n \n\nKeranique is another  product that I am slightly familiar with which may stop hair loss but  this is only because one of the five factors or whatever that they tout  is minoxidil. All the other steps simply add volume and coat the hair  strands. If the price is decent compared to buying minoxidil and  separate shampoo and conditioner, then go for it. At least this one has  the capacity to slightly grow vellus hair and thicken strands.    \n   \n This is a fair better  and more truthful article about options for women:  https://www.allure.com/story/hair-loss-treatment-plans that actually  mentions going to the dermatologist and some new treatments that show  promise but it still claims that Nutrafol is a good purchase.  \n   \n It does mention dandruff  shampoos which may work like Nizoral but not as effectively in terms of  slowing hair loss so that's true.  \n   \n I  go to a clinic that has literally scores of anti-aging treatments that  actually work for cis-females and transgender females, like  derma-rolling, botox, chemical peels, filler, collagen injections, etc.  and they still try to pawn off special shampoos or conditioners as you  go out the door. Some shampoos and conditioners do make a person's hair  more manageable or shiny but they do not grow hair or prevent hair loss  and none of them are worth more than $10.\n\nI know that many, many  transgender females don't have access to anyone to prescribe for them  or are afraid of unnatural hormones, and phytoestrogens do act in some  ways similarly to prescribed estrogenic hormones but they do so too weakly  so that on a bang for the buck basis, they aren't likely to provide effects  worth paying for in my opinion. Been there, done that. You know, like eating tofu for every meal....  \n \n\nBut cosmetic salons or hair salons are great, as long as no one gets  fooled.  Different types of hair styles that might be more manageable,  also heat and coating treatments that may make hair shiner, more  manageable, less frizzy, less likely to break off and other nice  cosmetic effects, and for many, many females these hair treatments  \"work\" and are worth the expense and it is a nice bonding experience.  Just don't buy any of their products thinking that you are going to  reverse hair loss.",

    "body": "Hello! I was diagnosed with AGA when I was very little, around puberty. My sister noticed it first. I always had a crazy amount of hair, pretty atypical for a family of very thin and fine hair. But it didn't last long, I started losing them around 14. Long story short, I'm 26, and over the years I tried them all, including Minoxidil 5%, of course, with awesome results, under my trichologist's advice. From 2018 to 2022 I wouldn't perceive I had hair loss because I could stop it and improve my hair density with Minoxidil. You could have never noticed I had AGA because I actually ended up having pretty thick hair (photo 1,2). At the time I was also prescribed Tricovel supplements but I must say I wasn't very good with them. I was taking them very very rarely so I can't say they helped me at the time. In 2022 after some years of moving around the world and changing my routine a lot, I ended up stopping Minoxidil 5%, mostly out of laziness and I started rosemary oil masks weekly. I felt that my hair got thinner, as I should have expected. I never ever had side effects with Minoxidil btw. Well, in December 2022 I started Minoxidil (Rogaine) 5% again with a lot of hope since it worked so well for years and I'm starting from not such a terrible situation as the first time. For the first time in years, I'm conscious about my hair and I hate this feeling I had forgotten. This time I want to be really good with my supplement and hair routine and hopefully I'll get even better results than the first time. I've been on Minoxidil for a little over a month now and the shedding has stopped. I bought a skin microscope on Amazon (super recommended!!!) to keep track of my progress. I could swear this tiny hair wasn't there in December. Does it look like regrowth to you already? (photos 3,4).  The pictures show the crown area, and in particular what I think are the thinniest points for me. Thank you everyone and I'm excited to chat with folks in this group! We got it!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d45zixhxruca1.jpg?width=2058&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=254f255e4974234c58d5fdcc39f5940516af1b24\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqg2cf05quca1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6eb75ae0d8f43acd94cb8d2a5be1a70072e3b41\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s73vjgw0quca1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4ccf45768cebde69eaad1d9b6faa06f67c6811\n\nHere is my current treatment and daily routine (THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE, I'M NOT A DOCTOR AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND SEEING ONE IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH AGA):\n\nMicroneedling 1.5mm once a week\n\nSaw Palmetto supplements daily\n\nTricovel (my old supplement from my trichologist) and Viviscal on alternate days\\*\n\nVit D3 and Vit 12 (these are kind of unrelated to hair loss, but could help)\n\nSaw Palmetto natural Shampoo with aloe vera every other day when I wash my hair\n\nMicrofiber towel after the shower\n\nI minimize hairspray and styling products to the minimum and I don't dye my hair\n\nMost importantly Rogaine women 5%\n\nI oil my hair with rosemary oil once a week.\n\n\\*these two supplements contain the usual vitamins and nutraceuticals you can find in any hair supplement, such as iron, zinc, horsetail extract, etc... I'll switch to Vivical every day when I finish Tricovel.. it was too expensive to waste two boxes ahahah\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, any opinion on my current regimen? Thank you!!",

I have been doing deep conditioning treatments every other day with no protein or aloe vera for the past month, sometimes with heat because my hair is somewhat low porosity, and it feels more moisturized than it did, but it still does not pass the stretch test, the shine is absent and my waves which were previously [2A or 2B?](https://imgur.com/a/95z4Pj1) are now much straighter and mostly just frizzy. I have clarified with both sulfate and sulfate-free clarifying shampoos and have done three vinegar rinses. is there anything else I can do to get some of the protein out or do I just have to give it more time?\n\n----------------\n\nedit: I thought I would post an update for anyone happening to read this thread looking for information on protein overload. the products I had in my rotation had a lot of hidden protein. the stearamidopropyl dimethylamine as discussed in the comments was not a problem - [it is not a protein or amino acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/f1fcr6/id_dimethylamine_an_amino_acid/) but some other ingredients were. Biotin in the V05 I was using to clarify. Lots of extracts - mentha aquatica leaf extract, coconut extract, rose extract, clover extract, horsetail extract... The Mane n Tail detangler is full of them. Extracts don't always have large amounts of protein and if they do it's not always small enough to make it past the pores, but there's no way to know so it's best to avoid them. I was using a curl cream on occasion which has lysine hcl (an amino acid) and a hairspray that had aminomethyl propanol (why did \"aminomethyl\" not ring alarm bells for me....).\n\nI cut out all these products and after a week my hair was back to being properly wavy. There was some other stuff that happened after that with a haircut though, suffice to say I am in protein overload again because I am a doormat and let my hairdresser do a keratin treatment and give me a blowout. I also realized my hair was high porosity, not lowish, and I am giving it the proper sequence of penetrating oils and sealing oils it needs, which is really helping with the shine and hydration.",

It has started becoming more noticeably thin and sparse, and I want to try to get thicker hair if possible. There's really nothing online about what to use AFTER AA (and my dermatologist basically just said there's no way to prevent a recurrence) but I'm thinking of using rosemary oil, maybe Prose for a   \n custom shampoo/conditioner. Prose also offered a supplement made with grape seed extract, inactive dried yeast, sesame seed extract, rice protein, DL-Methionine, and Horsetail Leaf Extract. \n\nAnyone else \"recovered\" from AA and has a good regimen?

The inspiration that got me to branch out into something more complicated is my horrible lush addiction (hyperbole lmao, I really have about 3 products I love and occasionally splurge on others, specific Sympathy for the Skin, Super Milk, and Turmeric Roll; gorgeous moisturizer is a huge splurge but I love, and when I’m feeling like a pick me up I love their fresh masks, though it’s more cost effective and fun to make my own and they don’t need to keep anyways). I’ve been researching with the goal of at least making a SFTS dupe since it goes the quickest for me, but can’t find much online. After looking at the ingredients on lush’s site, and playing around with different recipes for lotion, and trying to figure out the scent profile, I have a (maybe?) recipe. However, since it’s literally my first time I don’t know if this is gonna turn out terrible, and don’t wanna invest all these ingredients for them to be unusable. Do yall see any red flags here?

Propylparaben (preservative)\n\nVanilla compounds limited solubility in water, so I would assume that water can be substituted for *vanilla pod infusion*.\n\nThe 1% mark is almost certainly between 7 and 8. Anything under the 1% line is usually going to be scent, claims, preservative or active. Unfortunately at the line it is not possible to know how much of the ingredient is actually in the product, so without a specific number then even if there is a listed active we have no idea if there are only a couple molecules of it in there.\n\nSo, unless we can define a specific reason to add an ingredient under that line, it should be viewed as optional.\n\nI have put your formula into a table for better readability:\n\n| Phase | Ingredient | Percentage |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n| Water | Distilled Water | 71.60% |\n| | Glycerin | 3.00% |\n| | Honey | 2.00% |\n| Oil  | Shea Butter | 4.35% |\n| | Mango Butter | 4.35% |\n| | Neossance Squalane | 3.48% |\n| | Jojoba Oil | 3.48% |\n| | BTMS-50 | 2.61% |\n| | Cetyl Alcohol | 0.87% |\n| Cool Down | Banana Powder | 2.00% |\n| | Vanilla Bean Specks | 0.20% |\n| | Helichrysum Extract | 0.50% |\n| | Horsetail Extract | 0.50% |\n| | Ginger Root Extract | 0.50% |\n| | Vanilla Oleoresin | 0.04% |\n| | Lavender Essential Oil | 0.02% |\n| | Petitgrain Essential Oil | 0.02% |\n| | Optiphen Plus | 0.50% |\n\nHoney might be a decent substitute for bananas.

Recently I took a job that requires lots of driving, so I couldn’t detox quite as hard given inconsistent bathroom access. Lemon water and celery juice will make me full blown incontinent, so I’ve tapered back to the HMDS, a parsley and fruit smoothie for lunch, and the mango/banana/spinach smoothie as second lunch. I still have to pee every 1.5-2 hours, but can get by with some pads for urinary leakage. I’m also doing consistent Vimergy supplements for strep, plus l-lysine and horsetail extract and turkey tail mushrooms.\n\nI’m wondering since my bladder symptoms are so intense that I might be experiencing nerve healing to my bladder. Has anyone else healed this, and if so do you have any particular foods you found to be impactful?

Hair is made of protein and protein can help with curl structure and strength (again read the blog post). The recommendation I’ve seen is people with low porosity hair can have a little protein in one or two products or do a protein treatment once a month. Best practice is to try adding a little protein to your routine and try it once or twice to see how your hair reacts then switch off to a non-protein product for a few washes to see how your hair reacts. My hair is low porosity and fine and I currently use protein in my deep conditioner and gel and it is a little too much on the protein side of the protein-moisture balance. So I bought a moisture-only deep conditioner and for a few weeks I’m going to see if alternating my protein DC and my new moisture DC will help balance my hair.\n\n*exceptions if your hair is protein sensitive \n\nMy advice: if your budget allows get two deep conditioners (one with protein, one with moisture) or look for samples and travel sizes to try out a few DCs without committing to a whole tub of product. \n\nOne cautionary note: if you go with your second deep conditioner, it has glycerin high on its list. Glycerin works best in a certain temperant range of temperature, so if you are in a location that is has cold, dry air right now that product could cause frizz depending on your routine.",

I've read that cocamidopropyl betaine can easily remove amodimethicone (even regular dimethicone) without being harsh on your hair. I've tried searching for other milder, non-sulfate cleansers that can also do this, but cocamidopropyl betaine seems like the most popular choice. \n\n[Here](https://www.amazon.com/Palmers-Formula-Co-Wash-Cleansing-Conditioner/dp/B00EDQWRQ2/ref=sr_1_32_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1550859002&sr=1-32&keywords=cowash) is the product I've been looking at - Palmer's Olive Oil Formula Co-Wash Cleansing Conditioner, Non Lather Shampoo Alternative.

Is it high enough on the list though to make a difference?\n\nI've also looked for heat protectants that are silicone free or contain water soluble silicones only. My search has been unsuccessful... products with water-soluble silicones only that are high up in the ingredient list are basically unicorns that are impossible to find, and the options that don't use silicones at all seem to be pretty weak; not strong enough to protect against flat ironing, at least. \n\nIf someone here could tell me if it looks like I'm heading in the right direction, I'd be very grateful.

    "body": "# MetaNail Review: A Natural Nail Care Serum for Stronger, Healthier Nails\n\nIf brittle nails have you cringing at every handshake or peeling cuticle disasters keep stealing the spotlight, you’re not alone.\n\nWeak and damaged nails can zap confidence and even make daily tasks a struggle.\n\n[MetaNail](https://theworldhealth.org/metanail-official) is a serum promising to repair, nourish, and rejuvenate your nails—without any gimmicks or complicated routines. Let’s explore if this product truly delivers on its promises or if it’s all just a polished illusion.\n\n# Product Overview\n\n* **Product Name:** MetaNail\n* **Category:** Natural Nail Care Serum\n* **Overall Verdict:** 4.7/5\n\nMetaNail is marketed as a **natural nail care serum**, crafted to tackle everything from brittle tips to dry cuticles. Its formula features **organic ingredients for nail health**, aiming to restore your nails’ natural strength and sheen.\n\nWith claims of being an effective **nail strengthener for damaged nails**, it’s a tempting option for anyone looking to fix their manicure woes.\n\n# Detailed Product Analysis\n\nMetaNail’s **20-in-1 formula** sounds fancy, but it boils down to providing your nails with much-needed nourishment and care.\n\nWhat sets it apart is its simplicity: the serum works for both fingernails and toenails and is packed with natural goodies that promise results without harsh chemicals.\n\n# Key Ingredients and Benefits\n\n* **Witch Hazel, Scots Pine, and Horsetail Extract:** These natural powerhouses protect nails and skin while reducing inflammation.\n* **Gotu Kola:** Known for boosting circulation, it supports nail regrowth, making it ideal for those wondering **how to fix brittle nails**.\n* **Lemon Peel Extract and Aloe Vera:** These ingredients work to restore shine and moisture to dull, dry nails.\n* **Hyaluronic Acid and Glycerin:** These are the hydration champions, making MetaNail an excellent **hydrating serum for dry nails**.\n* **Rosemary and Jojoba Seed Oil:** These nourish cuticles and support a **comprehensive nail care routine**.\n\n# Ease of Use\n\nUsing MetaNail is refreshingly uncomplicated.

Within two weeks, I noticed my nails looked shinier, and even the peeling had stopped. I was finally able to enjoy a **nourishing nail serum benefit** without constantly worrying about breakage.\n\nThe only small hiccup? The natural scent wasn’t my favorite.

This ensures you receive the authentic product, access exclusive discounts, and benefit from the money-back guarantee. Third-party sellers may offer imitations that lack the quality and safety of the original.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMetaNail isn’t just a temporary fix—it’s a reliable solution for **nail repair for split nails**, hydration, and overall health. Whether you need a **nail strengthener for damaged nails** or want to incorporate it into your **comprehensive nail care routine**, this product ticks the boxes. Its results, paired with a natural formula, make it worth considering for anyone struggling with nail issues.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**1.

    "body": "In the rapidly evolving world of nail care, the Metanail Complex has emerged as a noteworthy product, attracting attention from both professionals and enthusiasts alike. As someone who values the health and appearance of nails, I took it upon myself to thoroughly test the Metanail Complex and document my findings. This review aims to provide an insightful examination of the product's effectiveness, ingredients, and overall usability.\n\n[ Metanail Complex ](https://preview.redd.it/jaoburnkkmcc1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6b154dbd69644c9e7d3b1447e26e81b04e39baf)\n\nDuring my assessment, I paid particular attention to the ease of application, the duration of wear, and the potential benefits that the Metanail Complex claims to offer. I understand that the market is flooded with promises of stronger, healthier nails, which is why I approached this review with a critical eye. My experiences with various nail treatments have taught me what to look for when evaluating such products.\n\nThe Metanail Complex stands out due to its unique formulation, intended to support nail strength and flexibility. I scrutinized the ingredient list, using my background knowledge to discern which components are truly beneficial for nail care versus those that are merely filler. Through this review, I hope to provide a clear and unbiased look at how the Metanail Complex performs under regular use conditions.\n\n## Understanding Metanail Complex\n\nMetanail Complex is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance nail health through its unique blend of natural ingredients and essential nutrients. Its formulation is aimed at promoting stronger, healthier nails while addressing common issues like brittleness and damage. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6vccx6skmcc1.jpg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=786b487638d6c2c50fa3e2f097deb2741d660f44\n\n### Composition and Ingredients\n\n**Metanail Complex** includes a blend of vitamins such as **Vitamin C** and **Vitamin E**, which are crucial for collagen production and antioxidant support, respectively. The presence of **organic green tea**, **jojoba seed oil**, **aloe vera**, **lemon peel extract**, and **horsetail extract** contributes to its antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. These organic ingredients support nail texture and hydration while fostering healthier nails.\n\n* **Natural Ingredients**: A host of vitamins, nutrients, and organic extracts\n* **Focus on Nail Health**: Targeting brittleness, dryness, and damage\n* **Antifungal and Antibacterial**: To maintain nail purity and prevent infections\n\n### Benefits for Nail Health\n\nI find that regular application of Metanail Complex significantly improves blood circulation to the nail beds, which is vital for nail growth and health. It also aids in the hydration of the cuticles, reducing dryness and brittleness. By supplying essential nutrients, the product promotes the strengthening of brittle nails and supports the overall texture and health of both the nails and cuticles.\n\n* **Hydration**: Essential oils and extracts for optimal nail and cuticle moisture\n* **Nutrients**: Vitamins and minerals to support nail strength and health\n* **Blood Circulation**: Enhanced circulation for better nutrient distribution\n\n### Application and Usage\n\nApplying Metanail Complex is simple. The serum or capsule can be used as part of a daily nail care routine, ideally after cleaning the nails and cuticles. For best results, it should be massaged gently onto the nails and surrounding skin to ensure proper absorption. Foot care is also a crucial aspect, and a similar application can be made to toenails if required.\n\n* **Serum/Capsule**: Convenient forms of the product for ease of use\n* **Daily Routine**: Best applied consistently for optimal results\n* **Massage**: Encourages absorption and increases blood flow\n\n### Side Effects and Precautions\n\nAlthough Metanail Complex is formulated with natural ingredients, individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test before regular use. Any adverse reactions should be noted, and use should be discontinued if inflammation or discomfort occurs. Overall, the product is well-tolerated by most users.\n\n* **Patch Test**: Recommended for those with sensitive skin\n* **Monitor Reactions**: To ensure compatibility and prevent adverse effects\n* **Discontinue if Necessary**: If side effects occur, stop usage immediately\n\n### Purchasing and Guarantees\n\nMetanail Complex can be purchased directly from the official website, ensuring GMP and FDA-approved manufacturing standards. It is made in the USA and comes with a 60-day money-back guarantee, which speaks to the confidence in its efficacy and the brand's commitment to customer satisfaction. The product combines affordability with a robust satisfaction guarantee.\n\n* **Official Website**: Purchase directly for product authenticity and guarantees\n* **60-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: A testament to its promised results\n* **FDA-Approved and GMP**: Ensuring high standards in production\n\n## Addressing Specific Nail Concerns\n\n📷\n\nIn my assessment of Metanail Complex, focusing on the specific nail issues is crucial. The product's ability to combat infection, heal damage, and provide nutritional support is underscored by customer experiences. Let's examine how Metanail targets these areas.\n\n### Combatting Nail Infections\n\n**Fungal Infections:** Metanail Complex offers a 20-in-1 formula with antifungal properties tailored to address toenail fungus. Notably, plant extracts such as gotu kola and witch hazel serve as antimicrobial and antifungal agents, working directly on various fungi causing nail infections. These ingredients not only alleviate symptoms such as *discoloration*, *itching*, and *pain* but also tackle the root cause of nail fungus.\n\n**Hydration and Circulation:** Ingredients like glycerin are integral in maintaining hydration, which is pivotal for healthier nails and mitigating brittleness or breakage. Improved circulation, another aspect of nail health, is enhanced by compounds that support skin health adjacent to the nail bed.\n\n# Restorative Treatments for Damaged Nails\n\n**Enhancing Collagen Production:** Collagen is vital for restoring the strength of nails, which the Metanail Complex aids through specific nutrients that trigger the body’s natural collagen production. Damaged nails benefit from this reinforcement, which improves both the appearance and integrity of the nail structure.\n\n**Replenishing Nutrients:** The product's content of sage leaf extract and other nourishing compounds offers nourishment, essential for health of nails that have suffered from damage due to chemicals or harsh environmental factors.\n\n### Nutrition and Dietary Support\n\n**Vitamins and Minerals:** Metanail Complex espouses a comprehensive approach with a spectrum of vitamins such as vitamins C and E, along with minerals. These are fundamental for both the health of nails and the skin surrounding them, contributing to their thickness and preventing breakage.\n\n* **Supplements:** For systemic support, the inclusion of MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane) in the complex aids in building keratin for nail health, while the dietary supplements ensure a steady supply of essential nutrients.\n\n### Customer Feedback and Reviews\n\n* **User Testimonials:** Direct feedback from users like Rachel M. and Michael O. suggests the effectiveness of Metanail Complex. Their experiences highlight significant improvements in their nail conditions.  \n\n\n[User Feedback Summary](https://preview.redd.it/lrblwj4fkmcc1.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f22dd1884a079ac4ba7f5523550bdb34ef707fb)\n\nOrganic infusions and a dedication to the absence of harsh chemicals position Metanail as a restorative option that aims for efficacy without compromising the natural state of the nail and skin. This commitment to nail health through holistic means is echoed in many reviews which praise the serum's restorative capabilities.",

Mycosyn Pro aims to break this cycle by addressing the underlying factors that allow fungi to flourish, such as weakened immunity, poor circulation, and imbalanced skin microbiomes.\n\nMycosyn Pro takes a more holistic approach. It leverages the power of natural ingredients that have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for their **antifungal, antibacterial,** and **anti-inflammatory** properties.\n\nOverall, Mycosyn Pro is marketed as a comprehensive, side-effect-free solution for those seeking to restore the health and appearance of their nails and skin, while also supporting overall immune function.\n\n# How Does Mycosyn Pro Work?\n\nMycosyn Pro targets fungal infections through a multi-step process, addressing the root causes and promoting long-term relief. It begins by enhancing the body’s natural immune defenses, which are **crucial for fighting off persistent fungal invaders**.\n\nBy strengthening the immune response, the body becomes more capable of identifying and eliminating fungal cells. Additionally, Mycosyn Pro works by creating an internal environment that is inhospitable to fungi.\n\nIt incorporates potent antifungal herbs and minerals that disrupt **fungal growth at a cellular level**, preventing them from multiplying and spreading further. This approach not only addresses existing infections but also helps reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.\n\nThis supplement also supports detoxification, helping the body eliminate harmful toxins and free radicals that can weaken the immune system and promote fungal growth. \n\nMoreover, Mycosyn Pro enhances circulation and oxygen delivery to the extremities, where fungal infections are most common. This **improved blood flow helps nourish the affected areas**, speeding up the healing process and promoting healthier skin and nails.\n\nFinally, the formula aids in restoring the natural microbiome balance of the skin, creating a protective barrier against future infections. This comprehensive approach makes Mycosyn Pro a promising solution for those struggling with chronic fungal issues.\n\n[**Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Here**](https://58d3c7ear0jg6n2bb5pi8f7z5w.hop.clickbank.net/) \n\n# Mycosyn Pro Ingredients\n\nMycosyn Pro is a dietary supplement formulated is carefully selected, all-natural ingredients, each chosen for their antifungal, immune-boosting, and skin-nourishing properties. Below is a detailed breakdown of its key ingredients and their reported benefits:\n\n# Vitamin A\n\nVitamin A is a vital fat-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in maintaining healthy skin.

    "body": "Hello everyone. I have lately been applying a foot balm (more on the product below) to my face, and I was wondering if it could be a bad idea...\n\nI am a male (23) and luckily I no longer have severe acne problems. Just the usual pimple or pustule, not more than 2 or 3 at a time. \n\nAbout a month ago or so, I tried using this foot balm on a single pimple that was growing on my face. Surprisingly, the pimple disappeared in 2 or 3 days, way faster than what they usually take. So since then I have been using it on every single pimple/pustule that starts growing on my face. This way they don't get as big and red as they used to, and they only last for 2 or 3 days.\n\nI'm not complaining at all, but I can't help but ask myself if doing this could be bad for my skin.

Mycosyn Pro aims to break this cycle by addressing the underlying factors that allow fungi to flourish, such as weakened immunity, poor circulation, and imbalanced skin microbiomes.\n\nMycosyn Pro takes a more holistic approach. It leverages the power of natural ingredients that have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for their **antifungal, antibacterial,** and **anti-inflammatory** properties.\n\nOverall, Mycosyn Pro is marketed as a comprehensive, side-effect-free solution for those seeking to restore the health and appearance of their nails and skin, while also supporting overall immune function.\n\n# How Does Mycosyn Pro Work?\n\nMycosyn Pro targets fungal infections through a multi-step process, addressing the root causes and promoting long-term relief. It begins by enhancing the body’s natural immune defenses, which are **crucial for fighting off persistent fungal invaders**.\n\nBy strengthening the immune response, the body becomes more capable of identifying and eliminating fungal cells. Additionally, Mycosyn Pro works by creating an internal environment that is inhospitable to fungi.\n\nIt incorporates potent antifungal herbs and minerals that disrupt **fungal growth at a cellular level**, preventing them from multiplying and spreading further. This approach not only addresses existing infections but also helps reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.\n\nThis supplement also supports detoxification, helping the body eliminate harmful toxins and free radicals that can weaken the immune system and promote fungal growth. \n\nMoreover, Mycosyn Pro enhances circulation and oxygen delivery to the extremities, where fungal infections are most common. This **improved blood flow helps nourish the affected areas**, speeding up the healing process and promoting healthier skin and nails.\n\nFinally, the formula aids in restoring the natural microbiome balance of the skin, creating a protective barrier against future infections. This comprehensive approach makes Mycosyn Pro a promising solution for those struggling with chronic fungal issues.\n\n[**Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Here**](https://58d3c7ear0jg6n2bb5pi8f7z5w.hop.clickbank.net/) \n\n# Mycosyn Pro Ingredients\n\nMycosyn Pro is a dietary supplement formulated is carefully selected, all-natural ingredients, each chosen for their antifungal, immune-boosting, and skin-nourishing properties. Below is a detailed breakdown of its key ingredients and their reported benefits:\n\n# Vitamin A\n\nVitamin A is a vital fat-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in maintaining healthy skin.

I did a 3-day fenticonazole treatment and it was better but not gone completely, so I decided to visit a doctor. She said my pH was off and diagnosed yeast infection. Since that, I was prescribed multiple treatments including natamycin, nifuratel, fluconazole, dequalinium chloride. My partner also did a round of fluconazole. I also took probiotics (both oral and vaginal). Over this time, the symptoms are basically on the same level - not as bad as at the beginning, but I still have the same discharge (just in a lesser quantity) and itching (but not consistent, I would say it happens a few times a day, mostly at night). I’ve been to multiple doctors and right now they’re basically as clueless as I am. I was tested for yeast, bacteria (standard and anaerobic), mycoplasma and ureaplasma. Everything came out negative. All my underwear is cotton, I don’t use scented pads or tampons, everything I use for intimate hygiene or laundry is hypoallergic (I have reactive skin in general). \nI tried to have penetrative sex few times during all of this and it always led to terrible burning.\n\nFew days ago I went off birth control, because the symptoms started 2 weeks after I went on Erva patch. I have been on pills before but never got similar symptoms. Is it possible for birth control to cause symptoms similar to infection without actually having one? I know that birth control increases the risks of infections, but from medical point of view (all swabs are negative) I’m basically healthy. \n\nLast doctor I went to suggested trying over-the-counter medicine with collagen and field horsetail extract. I’m hesitant to try this since I already used multiple medications and I don’t want to make this worse. \n\nIs there anything else I haven’t considered? I’m so tired of this but no matter what I do, the symptoms just won’t go away. \n\nTL;DR Was diagnosed with yeast infection in January, did the first round of treatment, it helped a bit but I still experience the symptoms. Since that time I did multiple treatments. The symptoms are still one the same level (white, clumpy discharge, itching, burning during sex), just not as intense as in the beginning. All swabs came out negative. \n\n",

        "body": "You mentioned you went on birth control 2 weeks before the symptoms began, I’m thinking this could be due to your hormones, changes in estrogen. Im currently on the same boat, same EXACT symptoms, was at the ER doing all sorts of tests. I swore up and down I had a yeast infection so I did fluconazole and monistat. Tests came back negative for it though. Definitely could have also been because I did the meds beforehand, but when the doc took a look he said it did look like a yeast infection due to the redness, inflammation & irritation- meds Didn’t get rid of my symptoms so I have been talking to my OBgyn and we came to the conclusion that this is due to my hormone changes since I just became pregnant not long ago.",

Turns out what I thought was “discharge” was just dry skin patches because my vagina is so dry from all the treatments. Same with itching and burning. She recommended going off birth control because it will be easier to regenerate the skin if the pH and hormones are in check. She prescribed me estrogen pills for two weeks, since it may help with restoring the balance and healing the skin. Then I have a boric acid treatment for 5 days each month for 3 next months. She really reassured me that everything was fine and that my skin needs help to heal. Will update this if this works out!\n\nBut please, don’t rely on just one gyno, go to different specialists, especially if you feel something is wrong but they reassure you you’re fine! Other doctors I’ve visited tried to convince that this “will pass” without even trying to examine me!",

Mycosyn Pro aims to break this cycle by addressing the underlying factors that allow fungi to flourish, such as weakened immunity, poor circulation, and imbalanced skin microbiomes.\n\nMycosyn Pro takes a more holistic approach. It leverages the power of natural ingredients that have been used for centuries in traditional medicine for their **antifungal, antibacterial,** and **anti-inflammatory** properties.\n\nOverall, Mycosyn Pro is marketed as a comprehensive, side-effect-free solution for those seeking to restore the health and appearance of their nails and skin, while also supporting overall immune function.\n\n# How Does Mycosyn Pro Work?\n\nMycosyn Pro targets fungal infections through a multi-step process, addressing the root causes and promoting long-term relief. It begins by enhancing the body’s natural immune defenses, which are **crucial for fighting off persistent fungal invaders**.\n\nBy strengthening the immune response, the body becomes more capable of identifying and eliminating fungal cells. Additionally, Mycosyn Pro works by creating an internal environment that is inhospitable to fungi.\n\nIt incorporates potent antifungal herbs and minerals that disrupt **fungal growth at a cellular level**, preventing them from multiplying and spreading further. This approach not only addresses existing infections but also helps reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.\n\nThis supplement also supports detoxification, helping the body eliminate harmful toxins and free radicals that can weaken the immune system and promote fungal growth. \n\nMoreover, Mycosyn Pro enhances circulation and oxygen delivery to the extremities, where fungal infections are most common. This **improved blood flow helps nourish the affected areas**, speeding up the healing process and promoting healthier skin and nails.\n\nFinally, the formula aids in restoring the natural microbiome balance of the skin, creating a protective barrier against future infections. This comprehensive approach makes Mycosyn Pro a promising solution for those struggling with chronic fungal issues.\n\n[**Visit Official Website To Get Exclusives Discount Offer: Click Here**](https://58d3c7ear0jg6n2bb5pi8f7z5w.hop.clickbank.net/) \n\n# Mycosyn Pro Ingredients\n\nMycosyn Pro is a dietary supplement formulated is carefully selected, all-natural ingredients, each chosen for their antifungal, immune-boosting, and skin-nourishing properties. Below is a detailed breakdown of its key ingredients and their reported benefits:\n\n# Vitamin A\n\nVitamin A is a vital fat-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in maintaining healthy skin.

This **improved blood flow helps nourish the affected areas**, speeding up the healing process and promoting healthier skin and nails.\n\nFinally, the formula aids in restoring the natural microbiome balance of the skin, creating a protective barrier against future infections.

These are the factors that played the largest role in our selection process.\n\n# Price Range\n\nAffordability without compromising quality was a key factor. We sought products that offer an excellent balance, ensuring that effective hair loss treatment doesn't have to break the bank. This criterion helped us narrow down options that provide real value to those seeking solutions for thinning hair and hair regrowth.\n\n# Customer Reviews\n\nFeedback from users who have experienced these hair loss treatments firsthand played a pivotal role. Reviews shed light on the actual impact of DHT blockers on hair follicles, revealing which products genuinely helped in reducing hair loss and promoting healthy hair growth.\n\n# Effectiveness\n\nThe core of our selection process was the effectiveness of each product in its ability to block DHT, a known culprit behind male pattern hair loss. We delved into clinical studies and ingredient lists, prioritizing products that have demonstrated the ability to stop DHT hair loss and encourage regrowth.\n\n# How To Find the Best DHT Blocker for Your Needs\n\nGiven the diverse range of products available, pinpointing the DHT blocker that aligns with your specific needs requires being mindful of various factors. Here, we’ll guide you through essential considerations to ensure that the DHT blocker you select not only inhibits DHT production effectively but also meshes well with your hair care routine.\n\n# Ingredient Profile\n\nExamine the active ingredients closely. Natural extracts like saw palmetto and pumpkin seed oil are renowned for their ability to inhibit[ DHT](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(1996)6+%3C88::AID-PROS17%3E3.0.CO;2-N) production without harsh side effects, offering a gentler approach to preserving hair follicles. For those facing male pattern baldness, ingredients with a strong track record in clinical studies, such as finasteride and minoxidil, might be the key to reversing hair thinning.\n\n# Dietary Suitability\n\nIf you opt for a dietary supplement, check the ingredient label to ensure the product doesn’t contain any ingredients that may conflict with your dietary restrictions and preferences. For instance, if you have a gluten allergy, you’ll want to look for gluten-free supplements. If you follow a plant-based diet, you’ll want to avoid supplements that contain animal-derived ingredients such as gelatin. \n\n# Formulation and Application\n\nWhether you prefer a shampoo, serum, or oral supplement can greatly influence your commitment to the treatment. Consider how the product fits into your daily routine and whether its application method suits your lifestyle, ensuring consistent use for optimal results.\n\n# Specific Hair Concerns\n\nTailor your choice to address additional hair concerns. If you're grappling with dryness or scalp sensitivity in addition to hair loss, look for DHT blockers enriched with moisturizing and soothing ingredients that support overall scalp health and nutrient absorption.\n\n# Consultation with Professionals\n\nBefore diving into any hair loss treatment, consulting with a healthcare provider or dermatologist can provide valuable insights. They can offer guidance tailored to your specific condition, including the extent of hair loss and underlying causes, ensuring the DHT blocker you choose is the most effective option for you.\n\n# The Role of Nutrition in Enhancing Hair Health and Inhibiting DHT Production\n\nA vital yet often overlooked component in the fight to inhibit DHT production lies within the very foundation of our daily lives: nutrition. What we fuel our bodies with has a profound impact not just on body hair growth but on the overall health and vitality of our hair. Here's a brief look into how integrating specific nutrients into your diet can bolster your hair health.\n\n* Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fish like salmon and flaxseeds, omega-3 can enhance hair density and diameter, offering a natural boost to hair health.\n* Zinc: This mineral, abundant in nuts and seeds, plays a crucial role in hair tissue growth and repair. It can also help keep the oil glands around the follicles working properly.\n* Vitamins A and E: Both vitamins are known for their antioxidant properties. Vitamin A helps skin glands produce sebum, which moisturizes the scalp and helps keep hair healthy, while Vitamin E helps protect your hair follicles against damage from free radicals.\n* Biotin: This B-vitamin is found in a wide variety of foods and is essential for hair protein synthesis, making it a key player in maintaining hair strength and texture.\n\nIncorporating these nutrients into your diet not only offers immune support and enhances your body’s overall well-being, but it can also naturally inhibit DHT production, thereby reducing the risk of hair loss. This holistic approach, combined with targeted hair loss treatments, can significantly amplify your efforts toward achieving robust hair health.\n\n# Potential Benefits of Using DHT Blockers\n\nCombating hair loss often leads to the exploration of DHT blockers. These powerful agents offer a beacon of hope, especially for those battling male pattern baldness, by targeting the root cause of many hair woes. Let's delve into the myriad of benefits these supplements provide, shedding light on how they can transform not only scalp hair but potentially even facial hair.\n\n# Combat Hair Loss\n\nOf course, the lead benefit of DHT blockers is their ability to combat hair loss. By inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT, these supplements directly address the hormonal imbalance responsible for weakening hair follicles, thereby slowing down and even reversing the process of hair thinning and hair loss.\n\n# Promote Hair Regrowth\n\nBeyond merely halting hair loss, DHT blockers can pave the way for new growth. Individuals experiencing male pattern baldness have reported not only a cessation of hair thinning but also the emergence of new, stronger hair strands, contributing to a fuller, healthier head of hair.\n\n# Enhance Hair Thickness\n\nConsistent use of a DHT blocker supplement can lead to thicker hair over time. As follicles are fortified against the adverse effects of DHT, the quality of new hair growth improves, resulting in strands that are denser and more robust.\n\n# Support Overall Hair Health\n\nThe benefits of DHT blockers extend to the overall health of hair. By fostering an environment where hair can grow uninhibited by DHT, these supplements contribute to enhanced hair strength, texture, and shine. For some, the reduction in DHT levels may also positively affect facial hair, promoting a more even or fuller beard.\n\n# Potential Side Effects of Using DHT Blockers\n\nWhile DHT blockers can be a powerful ally in the fight against hair loss, it's important to be aware of[ potential side effects](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-015-9319-y) that some individuals may experience. Here's a rundown of common concerns:\n\n* Decreased libido \n* Fatigue\n* Mood changes\n* Inflammation\n* Skin irritation (with the use of topical products)\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What are DHT-blocking supplements?\n\nA DHT-blocking supplement is a dietary supplement formulated to naturally reduce DHT levels. Lower levels of DHT can translate into less lost hair and improvements in general health. Simply said, DHT inhibitors can prevent DHT from making your hair fall out. Some of the most popular DHT blockers include green tea extract, saw palmetto extract, pygeum bark, stinging nettle root, pumpkin seed extract, lycopene, and grapefruit seed extract. \n\nHorsetail extract and bamboo extract have also demonstrated the ability to block DHT and zinc oxide is believed to act as a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. In other words, it blocks testosterone from being converted into DHT, making it a popular ingredient in many hair loss treatment products.  \n\n# How much DHT blocker should I use?\n\nThe appropriate amount of a DHT blocker supplement or topical solution varies by product. Follow the recommended dosage on the label or consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\n# Can I use a DHT blocker with other medication?\n\nIt's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before combining a DHT blocker with other medications to avoid interactions and ensure it doesn't affect body hair or other growth treatments.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAndrogenic alopecia is one of the leading causes of hair loss in men and women. Fortunately, finding the right solution can significantly turn the tide against hair loss. Whether you opt for supplements enriched with pumpkin seed oil and horsetail extract or topical treatments made with bamboo extract, these products can be invaluable in your battle against hair loss. Remember, patience and consistency are paramount. The journey to mitigating hair loss and encouraging regrowth takes time, but with the right DHT blocker in your arsenal, the battle against hair loss is one you can win",

This dietary supplement contains a powerful blend of natural ingredients that work together to nourish the scalp, stimulate hair follicles, and encourage healthy growth.  \nUnlike other hair loss treatments on the market, [Ultra FX10](https://ipsnews.net/business/2022/03/15/ultra-fx10-reviews-a-detailed-analysis-on-ultrafx10-supplement/) takes a holistic approach to combating hair loss by addressing the root causes rather than just treating the symptoms. It targets hormonal imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, inflammation, oxidative stress, and DHT production – all of which are common factors contributing to hair loss.  \nThis supplement is backed by extensive scientific research and has been formulated using only premium quality ingredients. The unique combination of vitamins (such as Biotin), minerals (like Zinc), herbal extracts (including Saw Palmetto), antioxidant-rich fruits (such as Pomegranate), and essential amino acids work synergistically to revitalize your scalp health and promote stronger, thicker strands from within.  \nOne of the standout features of Ultra FX10 is its ability to provide comprehensive support for both men and women experiencing various degrees of hair loss or thinning. Whether you're dealing with age-related baldness or simply want fuller-looking locks, this supplement can help jumpstart your journey towards healthier tresses.  \nWith regular use of Ultra FX10 Supplement as part of your daily routine, you can expect noticeable improvements in your overall hair health. So say goodbye to those days spent stressing over shedding strands – it's time to embrace a head full of beautiful locks!\n\n**How Does it Work?**  \n[Ultra FX10 is hair regrowth supplement](https://ipsnews.net/business/2021/02/03/ultra-fx10-hair-supplement-reviews-safe-ingredients/) that targets the root cause of hair loss and promotes healthy hair growth. Unlike other products on the market, this supplement focuses on addressing the internal factors that contribute to thinning hair and baldness.  \nThe key to its effectiveness lies in its powerful blend of natural ingredients that work synergistically to nourish the scalp and promote healthy follicles. These ingredients, such as saw palmetto extract and nettle root extract, help to block DHT (dihydrotestosterone), a hormone known to be one of the leading causes of male pattern baldness.  \nBy reducing DHT levels in the body, Ultra FX10 helps to rejuvenate dormant follicles and stimulate new hair growth. It also provides essential nutrients like biotin and vitamins A, C, and E which are necessary for strong and healthy hair.  \nFurthermore, Ultra FX10 contains antioxidants that help combat free radicals which can damage hair cells. This not only supports overall scalp health but also ensures optimal conditions for regrowth.  \nWith consistent use, Ultra FX10 can help improve blood circulation to the scalp, strengthen existing hairs, reduce breakage, and promote thicker and fuller-looking locks.  \nUltra FX10 works by addressing the underlying causes of hair loss while providing vital nutrients for optimal hair health. With its potent formula packed with natural ingredients, it offers a holistic approach towards achieving luscious locks.\n\n## What are the Ingredients?\n\nUltra FX10 Supplement is a powerful formula that combines natural ingredients to promote hair regrowth. The carefully selected ingredients work synergistically to address the root causes of hair loss and stimulate the growth of healthy, strong strands.  \nOne key [ingredient in Ultra FX10](https://wellquestmedical.com/ultra-fx10-reviews/) is biotin, also known as vitamin B7. Biotin plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of our hair, skin, and nails. It helps strengthen the hair follicles from within and encourages new growth.  \nAnother important ingredient is saw palmetto extract. This natural herb has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including hair loss. Saw palmetto works by blocking the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone responsible for shrinking hair follicles.  \nNiacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, is another notable ingredient in Ultra FX10. Niacinamide improves blood circulation to the scalp, ensuring that essential nutrients reach the hair follicles and support healthy growth.  \nOther ingredients include horsetail extract which contains silica that strengthens weak and brittle strands; zinc which supports cellular function and promotes healthy scalp; nettle root extract which helps inhibit DHT production; and bamboo stem powder rich in minerals necessary for optimal hair health.  \nBy combining these potent ingredients together into one supplement, Ultra FX10 provides comprehensive support for improving hair regrowth from within.\n\n## What are the Benefits?\n\nWhen it comes to hair regrowth, Ultra FX10 Supplement offers a range of benefits that can help improve the health and appearance of your hair. One of the key benefits is its ability to promote thicker and stronger hair growth. By nourishing the scalp and follicles with essential vitamins and minerals, this supplement helps to stimulate new hair growth from the root.  \nAnother [benefit of Ultra FX10](https://www.nuvectramedical.com/ultrafx10-reviews/) is its ability to prevent further hair loss. The ingredients in this supplement work together to inhibit the production of DHT, a hormone known for causing hair loss. By reducing DHT levels in the body, Ultra FX10 helps to prevent further damage to your precious locks.  \nIn addition, this supplement also improves overall hair health by providing essential nutrients that support healthy follicle function. This means less breakage, split ends, and dullness – hello shiny and vibrant tresses!  \nFurthermore, Ultra FX10 can also improve scalp health by reducing inflammation and improving blood circulation in the scalp. A healthier scalp provides a better environment for optimal hair growth.  \nUltra FX10 Supplement offers multiple benefits when it comes to improving your hair regrowth journey - thicker strands, reduced shedding, improved overall health - what more could you ask for? Give your locks some love with Ultra FX10!\n\n## How to Consume Ultra FX10?\n\nWhen it comes to improving hair regrowth, taking the right supplements in the right way is crucial. The same applies to Ultra FX10. To ensure optimal results, it's important to know how to consume this supplement properly.  \nThe recommended[ dosage for Ultra FX10](https://nehealthcareworkforce.org/ultrafx10-reviews/) is two capsules per day. It is best to take one capsule in the morning and another one in the evening with a glass of water. This allows for better absorption of the nutrients by your body.  \nIt's important not to exceed the recommended dosage as it may not necessarily provide better results and could potentially cause adverse effects. Consistency is key when taking any supplement, so make sure you incorporate it into your daily routine.  \nTo maximize its benefits, it's also advisable to maintain a healthy lifestyle alongside taking Ultra FX10. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals that promote hair growth, exercising regularly, managing stress levels, and getting enough sleep.  \nRemember that individual results may vary, and it might take some time before you start noticing significant changes in hair regrowth. Patience is essential on this journey towards healthier and fuller hair.  \nBy following these simple guidelines on how to consume Ultra FX10 properly while maintaining a healthy lifestyle overall, you can give yourself the best chance at achieving improved hair regrowth naturally!\n\n## What is the Price?\n\nIf you're interested in trying out Ultra FX10 Supplement to improve your hair regrowth, you might be wondering about the price.

Each package offers different savings and discounts.  \nFor those who want to try it out first or only need a short-term solution, the one-month supply is perfect. It's affordable and allows you to experience the benefits firsthand without committing to a longer period.  \nHowever, if you're serious about [improving your hair growth](https://www.saulmd.com/ultra-fx10-reviews/) and want long-lasting results, I highly recommend going for either the three-month or six-month supply. Not only will these packages save you money in the long run but they also give your body enough time to fully absorb and benefit from Ultra FX10's powerful ingredients.  \nRemember, investing in your hair health is an investment in yourself.

That's why I'm most skeptical about this product, even though it's the cheapest and has the most ingredients – though that doesn't necessarily mean anything. But since all the other products in the shop, like dermarollers, etc., are outrageously overpriced, I would be surprised if this particular product was actually worth its price. On the other hand, the other manufacturers are probably making huge margins on their products as well, that's for sure.",

Read the in-depth review, let’s get an overview of the product, dosage, pricing, guarantee, and more.\n\n**What Is Divine Locks Complex?**\n\nFirst, let's make a little bit more familiar with the supplement. So, the Divine Locks Complex is supposedly a brand-new innovation in the hair health field. It is said to have a breakthrough formula with a blend of organic ingredients. And according to the claims, those ingredients can significantly benefit your hair.\n\nAlthough we will go through the actual benefits below, let us review the advertised benefits first. By knowing about the advertised benefits, you will have a reference point and be capable of connecting dots later down the discussion.\n\n[**Click to Visit the Divine Locks' Official Website**](https://divine-lock.us/order-now)\n\n**Renews Hair Growth**\n\nThe formula of the Divine Locks Complex claims to help with the repair process of the hair follicles. It supposedly rejuvenates the hair and makes them grow stronger and thicker.\n\nAccording to the Divine Locks, renewed hair growth will help reinvigorate the special cells that are within the hair follicles. These special cells are directly responsible for regulating hair fall, development, and hair health. In other words, Divine Locks aims to eliminate all of your hair worries and problems.\n\n**Helps to Get Head Full of Hair**\n\nDivine Locks has captured the attention of most customers by stating that they can get a head full of hair. Well, it is indeed a statement that can catch attention. Having strong and fuller hair is one of the things that can increase your confidence. Such attributes to the hair can surely make your overall outlook appealing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahgasmhd7crb1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4679d79a098210538751d0b3949ac113ee081ca\n\n**Fights Hair Fall**\n\nDivine Locks supposedly has a solution for people who find their pillows full of hair after waking up. Likewise, the brand gives hope to the people whose bathroom clogs up with fallen hair.\n\nThe formula purportedly offers enhanced integrity and strength to the hair. By doing so, Divine Locks Complex will supposedly increase the overall looks and strength of the hair.\n\n**Makes You Look Younger**\n\nA lot of women are insecure about the aging signs of their hair. Divine Complex claims that the formula will get rid of that insecurity for good. The ingredients will supposedly make the hair gain the state it had during your younger years.\n\n[**Purchase Divine Locks for a Limited-Time Promotional Price** ](https://divine-lock.us/order-now)\n\n**Ingredients of Divine Locks Complex**\n\nSo, to know whether all the claims of the Divine Locks are legit or not, you need to understand the ingredients that are in the formula. As stated earlier, Divine Locks claim to have nothing but organic ingredients inside the formula. And from what we can tell, that claim is legit!\n\nThe formula has a total of 28 natural herbs that are in a highly potent form. Most of the formula's ingredients are proven to be highly beneficial to hair health. Let's talk a little about some of the highlights to give you a better understanding of the formula:\n\nPolygonum Multiflorum\n\nOtherwise known as Chinese Knotweed and Fo-Ti, this herb is proven to prevent the aging signs of the hair. It does that by preventing the hair from turning grey. And it also prevents the age-induced health degradation of the hair.\n\nThe ingredient has been used by many to promote the vitality and virility of the hair. Many even rely on the element to treat health issues.\n\nAccording to Divine Locks Complex, the ingredient is the only element available in the world that can open up blocked and pinched-up dermal papillae. Well, that statement is totally valid.\n\nYou will be surprised to know that the element can make the body produce more damage-repairing cells. These cells replace the damaged ones and make the body grow new hair.\n\nSpirulina\n\nYou might not know this, but Spirulina is a famous alga that most traditional medicine cultures have relied on. Humans have relied on it for centuries to treat different health issues. However, hair issues are where it shines the most.\n\nIt is well-known for making the hair grow thicker, stronger, and fuller. Some of the studies have even shown that the usage of Spirulina can increase hair growth by up to124 percent. So, it goes without saying that this ingredient in the formula will enhance your hair health significantly.\n\nSaw Palmetto\n\nRecently, the ingredient Saw Palmetto has picked up a lot of fame. Different researchers have been looking into it. They have found that it can enhance hair volume by 27 percent.\n\nAlso, studies have found that the ingredient can double the overall thickness of the hair strands. And most importantly, it can decrease hair shedding and increase hair quality by 60 percent.\n\nBut that is not all! Studies have found that Saw Palmetto could decrease the hair's overall dirt buildup and greasiness by 83 percent. That means your hair will have full protection from damage.\n\nBamboo and Horsetail Extract\n\nThe bamboo and horsetail extract that you will find in the formula of Divine Locks are abundant sources of the mineral Silica. But what does mineral Silica has to do with the health of your hair? Well, Silica is well-known for promoting the growth of hair in women.\n\nIn some cases, the growth rate can be up to 124 percent more than the natural growth rate. It is one of the building blocks of life, which is why it plays such a crucial role in hair's health. The two extracts also help to grow a thicker mane and reduce the severity of hair breakages.\n\nUrtica Diocia\n\nAmong all the ingredients that are present in the Divine Locks Complex, Urtica Diocia is one of the special ones. What makes it special? It is one of the elements that will promote the production of dermal papillae.\n\n[**Limited Time Special Pricing - Act Now to Order Your Bottle!**](https://divine-lock.us/order-now)\n\nWhen the production of dermal papillae increases in your hair, the number of pinched and damaged cells will be low. They will be replaced with new ones. Through this, the nutrient pathway to the hair opens up, and the hair starts to thrive more.\n\nGlycine Max\n\nDifferent studies showed that Glycine Max also has the ability to improve the production of dermal papillae. According to those studies, the element can produce up to 10 percent more of the cells when combined with Urtica Diocia. Also, it is known to improve hair growth significantly.\n\nBiotin\n\nBiotin is an important ingredient that our body requires for various functions. But it plays a crucial role in terms of hair growth. Although the bacteria present in our gut can produce this element, research shows that almost 38 percent of women have a deficiency.\n\nNonetheless, this compound can help lower the hair fall rate significantly. It also promotes new hair growth by up to 32 percent.\n\nPantothenate\n\nThis herb is highly capable of preventing hair loss. It is powerful enough to make the hair growth rate accelerate significantly. In fact, it can make the growth rate exceed the hair loss rate. So, it goes without saying that the element will help to get more hair volume.\n\nAlfalfa\n\nAnother powerful ingredient that is present in the formula is Alfalfa. It is there to prevent the damage that body cells face from the oxidation of free radicals. The herb also has the ability to fight off contaminants and pathogens. It will even keep your body away from harmful chemicals and toxins.\n\nPeony\n\nThis anti-inflammatory agent is known to reduce hair fall that happens from inflammations. That includes both the high-level and low-level inflammations that are brought by pathogens. Also, it has the ability to protect hair health from toxins.\n\nVitamin E\n\nOne of the important body nutrients is vitamin E. Our body requires it for multiple purposes. And let's not forget to mention that it has a significant role in the immunity of your body. Now, when it comes to the hair, vitamin E ensures that the blow to the hair follicles is at the right rate.\n\nThanks to that, it is highly capable of improving the nutrient exchange of your hair follicles. And eventually, you will end up with more functional and healthier dermal papillae.\n\n[**Click to Know More About Divine Locks’ Ingredients**](https://divine-lock.us/order-now)\n\n**The Benefits:**\n\n* It restores the supply of nutrients to the hair follicles.\n* It strengthens the hair follicles and reduces the breakage of hair.\n* It increases the thickness of your hair.\n* It adds luster and volume to your hair.\n* It helps to cover bald spots on the head and supports hair regeneration.\n* It strengthens individual hair strands and reduces hair fall and breakage.\n* It puts an end to problems like split ends.\n* It speeds up hair growth naturally.\n* It consists of ingredients backed by science and works at a cellular level.\n* It naturally boosts hair growth and doesn’t cause side effects.\n* It allows more blood regulation to nourish your scalp for better and nourished hair growth. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nDivine Locks has emerged as a game-changer in the world of hair care, offering a transformative solution to common hair problems.

Metanail serum pro is formulated with a blend of natural ingredients. It is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving no oily residue or stickiness. It is a non-toxic product that can be the ideal nail-saving serum. Not only does it save your nails from fungal infections and other problems, but is designed to offer long-lasting results and beautiful hands and feet. \n\nIt is a 20 in 1 topical formula consisting of all-natural ingredients that are backed by scientific research to help maintain and improve nail health. Moreover, it is manufactured in an FDA-approved facility while following all good manufacturing practices so that’s another plus point. It also has many positive customer reviews.\n\n**What is the Working Process of Metanail Pro Serum?**\n\nMetaNail Serum Pro, a unique nail care complex, helps you eliminate harmful nail fungi such as T. rubrum. The United States is home to a large population of people with this fungus. T. rubrum causes the majority of serious health problems. This fungus, if not treated in time, can damage vital organs such as the heart and lungs. It can even cause damage to toes and bones in some cases. MetaNail Serum Pro effectively removes T.rubrum and its associated issues.\n\nThis serum is formulated to provide the nutrients necessary for healthy and robust nails. It contains vitamins and minerals such as zinc and calcium. Serum ensures that keratin is produced in a healthy manner. Keratin, the protein that hardens hair and nails is important for your health. The body produces keratin naturally, but sometimes production can slow down. Metanail Serum Pro USA increases keratin.\n\n[**Visit the official website for more information on Metanail Serum Pro.!**](https://metanail.promancorp.com/)\n\n**Metanail Serum Pro Ingredients :**\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the right product, it is important to consider the ingredients used in it. The ingredients help you understand the quality of the product and whether the product is the right fit for you or not. Unlike conventional nail growth serums, Metanail Serum Pro is formulated with natural and strong ingredients that can help your nails get the strength and growth they had and are nourished without any side effects. The ingredients present in Metanail are: \n\n**Glycerin**\n\nGlycerin, also known as glycerol is a commonly used ingredient in skincare and cosmetic products. It is a colorless, odorless, and viscous liquid that can help to keep moisture on the skin and nails. It is an excellent remedy for people who have dehydrated skin as it has properties that create a barrier around the skin. This traps moisture allowing your skin to absorb it completely, keeping your skin fresh, hydrated, and soft. \n\n**Vitamin E and Vitamin C**\n\nThese two essential vitamins are used mainly in cosmetic and skin care products like serums and moisturizers. These vitamins, when used together give a synergistic effect. When combined, these vitamins provide anti-aging and protective benefits to the skin. Additionally, they are essential for the production of collagen which is the building block of fingernails. Collagen gives the nails shape, strength, and integrity. \n\n**Lemon peel extract**\n\nIt is a versatile and natural ingredient that is derived from the outer layer of lemon fruit. It is beneficial for skin and nails and is loaded with essential vitamins, antioxidants, and other important compounds. It is used as a remedy for discoloration on nails as it can help remove stains and brighten the look of a nail and make them healthier. It is also rich in oils and humectants that can keep the skin hydrated keeping it soft and safe. \n\n**Aloe Vera gel extract**\n\nAloe Vera gel extract comes from the Aloe Vera plant and is known for its numerous health benefits and skincare benefits. It is a popular element of skin care products in the modern world as it has been used as a traditional medicine for many years. Aloe Vera contains amino acids, which are essential in the formation of keratin, a protein that makes up the nails. The use of Aloe Vera on nails can help strengthen them, making them less prone to breaking and splitting. Much like the lemon peel extract, it is loaded with a protein known as 14kDa, which bears powerful nail rejuvenating properties. Additionally, Aloe Vera has antifungal properties that can prevent nail fungus and take care of cuticles.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**\n\nIt is a naturally occurring acid in the body. Hyaluronic acid has become popular as an ingredient in skincare products for its numerous benefits. It prevents the drying and cracking of nails while also strengthening them by promoting the production of collagen. It also moisturizes and nourishes the cuticle all while promoting the health of the nail bed and increasing blood flow and promoting the growth of healthy cells. \n\n**MSM**\n\nMSM is a naturally occurring compound and is used as an ingredient in many skin and nail care products. It has helped promote the growth of healthy and strong nails by increasing and improving the production of keratin. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation and promote healing in nails. Moreover, it takes care of the cuticles and improves the appearance of discolored or yellow nails making them look brighter and cleaner. \n\n**Jojoba seed oil extract**\n\nDerived from the seeds of the jojoba plant, jojoba seed oil extract is very beneficial for nail health. Not only does it moisturize the skin and leave it soft but it also helps calm and soothe irritated skin and nails. It promotes healthy nail growth and is uniquely effective when it comes to long-term nail and foot comfort. \n\n**Sage leaf extract**\n\nDerived from the leaves of the sage plant, sage leaf extract works almost the same as jojoba seed oil extract. It has anti-inflammatory properties and promotes healthy and strong nail growth.  \n\n**Organic green tea and hops**\n\nGreen tea contains numerous beneficial compounds such as antioxidants which can help promote healthy skin and nails. \n\n**Rosemary and pelargonium graveolens**\n\nBoth are organic botanical plants that have been traditionally used in skincare. Rosemary is an organic herb that contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Pelargonium graveolens is a plant that has a sweet floral scent and is known for its balancing effect on the skin. It is used in Metanail Serum Pro because it is known to strengthen nails and promote healthy growth.\n\n**Gotu Kola**\n\nGotu Kola is a herb that has been traditionally used for its healing and rejuvenating properties. It improves circulation and boosts the production of collagen, providing strength and structure to nails and preventing brittleness and breakage. \n\n**Witch hazel, Scott pine, and horsetail extract**\n\nWitch hazel, Scott pine, and horsetail extract are natural plant extracts that are very beneficial for skin and nail care. All three are rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Horsetail is rich in silica, a mineral that is important for strong nails and healthy skin. All in all, all three are used to promote and support nail health and give you strong and nourished nails. \n\n[**Order Metanail Complex Right Here At The Best Prices.!!**](https://metanail.promancorp.com/order-now)\n\n**Metanail Complex Pro Serum's Multifaceted Benefits**\n\nMetanail Complex Pro Serum offers various advantages that cater to nail and foot concerns.

    "body": "Diuretic supplements are natural or herbal products that promote urine production to reduce fluid retention, potentially aiding conditions like mild bloating, swelling, or supporting blood pressure management. Unlike pharmaceutical diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide), their effects are milder and less rigorously studied, but they are popular for their perceived safety and minimal side effects when used appropriately. Below are the **top five diuretic supplements**, selected based on available research, traditional use, safety profiles, and prevalence in reputable sources (e.g., peer-reviewed studies, health websites like Healthline, Mayo Clinic). These are ranked by evidence strength, potency, and practical use, with a focus on supplements (not foods, though some are derived from plants also consumed as food). Always consult a healthcare provider before using diuretic supplements, especially if you have kidney issues, hypertension, or are on medications, as they may cause electrolyte imbalances or drug interactions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Dandelion Extract (Taraxacum officinale)\n- **Why It’s Top**: Dandelion leaf and root extracts are among the most studied herbal diuretics, with a high potassium content (~397 mg/100 g in leaves) that promotes urine production without significant electrolyte loss. It’s widely used for fluid retention and mild hypertension.\n- **Evidence**: A 2009 pilot study in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* found that dandelion leaf extract (8 mL, three times daily) increased urinary frequency and volume in 17 healthy adults within 5 hours of the first dose, with effects persisting after the second dose. Animal studies support its diuretic action due to potassium and compounds like taraxasterol.[](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-diuretic-foods-drinks)[](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/natural-diuretics-foods-and-supplements)\n- **Benefits**: May reduce bloating, support kidney function, and provide antioxidants. Its potassium-sparing nature minimizes risks of hypokalemia compared to synthetic diuretics.\n- **How to Use**: Available as capsules (500–2,000 mg/day), tea (1–2 tsp dried leaves steeped in 8 oz water), or tinctures. Typical dose: 500 mg capsules 2–3 times daily.\n- **Cautions**: May interact with blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), lithium, or diuretics. Avoid if allergic to ragweed or related plants (e.g., daisies). Not recommended for severe kidney disease.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)[](https://www.verywellhealth.com/natural-diuretics-8546926)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Horsetail Extract (Equisetum arvense)\n- **Why It’s Effective**: Horsetail has a long history as a diuretic in traditional medicine, with modern studies suggesting efficacy comparable to pharmaceutical diuretics but with fewer side effects.\n- **Evidence**: A 2014 randomized controlled trial in *Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine* tested horsetail extract (900 mg/day) in 36 healthy men, finding diuretic effects equivalent to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, with less sodium and potassium loss. Another trial (0.75 g/day for 2 days) showed increased sodium and chloride excretion.[](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/natural-diuretic/)\n- **Benefits**: May reduce edema, support urinary tract health, and prevent kidney stones. Contains silica, which supports connective tissue health.\n- **How to Use**: Capsules (300–900 mg/day) or tea (1–2 tsp dried herb in 8 oz water, 1–2 times daily). Follow product dosing instructions.\n- **Cautions**: Long-term use may deplete thiamine due to an anti-thiamine factor. Avoid in kidney disease, pregnancy, or with potassium-lowering drugs. High doses may cause skin irritation or toxicity.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)[](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/natural-diuretics-foods-and-supplements)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hibiscus Extract (Hibiscus sabdariffa)\n- **Why It’s Effective**: Hibiscus, often consumed as tea or in capsules, acts as a diuretic and may lower blood pressure by increasing kidney filtration and reducing sodium retention.\n- **Evidence**: A 2012 study in *Journal of Ethnopharmacology* found hibiscus extract increased urine output in rats by modulating aldosterone activity. A 2010 meta-analysis in *Phytomedicine* showed hibiscus tea (1–2 cups daily) reduced systolic blood pressure by ~7 mm Hg in pre-hypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults. Human studies confirm diuretic effects without significant electrolyte loss.[](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313001)[](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/natural-diuretics/)\n- **Benefits**: Supports blood pressure control, reduces bloating, and provides antioxidants (anthocyanins). May benefit metabolic syndrome.\n- **How to Use**: Capsules (500–1,000 mg/day) or tea (1–2 tsp dried calyces in 8 oz hot water, 1–2 times daily). Standardized extracts ensure consistent dosing.\n- **Cautions**: May lower blood pressure excessively if combined with antihypertensive drugs. Avoid in pregnancy or with low blood pressure.[](https://www.verywellhealth.com/natural-diuretics-8546926)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hawthorn Extract (Crataegus monogyna or laevigata)\n- **Why It’s Effective**: Hawthorn, traditionally used for heart health, has mild diuretic properties that help reduce fluid overload, particularly in heart failure or hypertension.\n- **Evidence**: A 2002 trial in *American Heart Journal* found hawthorn extract (WS 1442, 900 mg/day) improved exercise capacity and reduced fluid retention in heart failure patients, with diuretic effects noted. A 2019 study in *World Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences* suggests its flavonoids enhance renal excretion. Limited human studies confirm diuretic action, but animal data are promising.[](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/natural-diuretics/)\n- **Benefits**: Supports cardiovascular health, reduces swelling, and may lower blood pressure. Rich in antioxidants (procyanidins).\n- **How to Use**: Capsules (500–1,200 mg/day, standardized to flavonoids) or tea (1 tsp dried berries/leaves in 8 oz water). Follow label instructions.\n- **Cautions**: May interact with heart medications (e.g., digoxin, beta-blockers). Avoid in severe kidney disease or with low blood pressure. Consult a doctor for heart conditions.[](https://www.verywellhealth.com/natural-diuretics-8546926)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Black Cumin Seed Extract (Nigella sativa)\n- **Why It’s Effective**: Black cumin (black seed) has diuretic properties and is studied for its potential to lower blood pressure, making it a dual-purpose supplement for fluid balance and hypertension.\n- **Evidence**: A 2016 study in *Journal of Hypertension* found black cumin seed extract (200–400 mg daily for 2 months) reduced systolic blood pressure by ~5 mm Hg in 120 men with mild hypertension, partly due to increased urine output and sodium excretion. Animal studies (e.g., *Phytotherapy Research*, 2010) confirm diuretic effects comparable to furosemide in rats.[](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313001)[](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/natural-diuretic/)\n- **Benefits**: May reduce bloating, support kidney function, and lower blood pressure. Contains thymoquinone, an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory effects.\n- **How to Use**: Capsules (100–500 mg/day) or oil (1–2 tsp daily). Seeds can be added to food, but extracts are more potent for diuretic effects.\n- **Cautions**: High doses may cause liver damage. Avoid in pregnancy or with low blood pressure. May interact with blood pressure medications or diabetes drugs.[](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313001)\n\n---\n\n### Critical Notes and Considerations\n- **Evidence Gaps**: While dandelion and horsetail have direct human studies on diuretic effects, hibiscus, hawthorn, and black cumin rely more on animal data or indirect evidence (e.g., blood pressure reduction). More clinical trials are needed for all.[](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-diuretic-foods-drinks)[](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/natural-diuretics/)\n- **Mechanisms**: These supplements work by increasing renal sodium and water excretion (via potassium or flavonoids), relaxing blood vessels, or enhancing kidney filtration. They are gentler than prescription diuretics, making them better for mild fluid retention than severe conditions like heart failure.\n- **Safety**: \n  - **Kidney Health**: Avoid in advanced kidney disease, as herbs like horsetail or dandelion may irritate kidneys or disrupt electrolyte balance.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)\n  - **Drug Interactions**: All may interact with diuretics, antihypertensives, or blood thinners. Consult a doctor if on medications.[](https://www.verywellhealth.com/natural-diuretics-8546926)\n  - **Electrolyte Balance**: Most are potassium-sparing, reducing hypokalemia risk, but excessive use can still cause dehydration or low sodium.[](https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/diuretic-treatment-high-blood-pressure)\n  - **Pregnancy/Breastfeeding**: Avoid all except under medical supervision due to limited safety data.[](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/7-best-natural-diuretics/)\n- **Regulation**: Supplements are not FDA-regulated for purity or dose. Choose products tested by third parties (e.g., USP, NSF) to ensure quality.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)\n- **Not for Weight Loss**: Diuretics reduce water weight, not fat, so effects are temporary and not a substitute for diet/exercise.[](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/313001)\n- **Comparison to Foods**: Supplements are more concentrated than diuretic foods (e.g., watermelon, celery), offering stronger effects but higher risks if misused.\n\n---\n\n### Why These Were Chosen\n- **Dandelion and Horsetail**: Topped the list due to direct human studies showing significant diuretic effects and potassium-sparing properties, making them safer and more reliable.[](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-diuretic-foods-drinks)[](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/natural-diuretic/)\n- **Hibiscus**: Included for its dual diuretic and blood pressure-lowering effects, supported by human and animal data, and widespread use as a safe tea or supplement.[](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/natural-diuretics/)\n- **Hawthorn**: Selected for its cardiovascular benefits and mild diuretic action, especially relevant for hypertension or heart-related fluid retention.[](https://www.forbes.com/health/nutrition/natural-diuretics/)\n- **Black Cumin**: Added for emerging evidence of diuretic and antihypertensive effects, though human data are less robust than for dandelion or horsetail.[](https://health.selfdecode.com/blog/natural-diuretic/)\n- **Exclusions**: Other candidates (e.g., parsley, juniper, green tea) were excluded as supplements due to insufficient human evidence, weaker diuretic effects (e.g., caffeine in green tea), or higher risks (e.g., juniper’s kidney irritation). Parsley is better as a food, and juniper lacks consistent data.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)[](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/7-best-natural-diuretics/)\n\n---\n\n### Practical Recommendations\n- **Start Low**: Begin with the lowest recommended dose (e.g., 500 mg dandelion or 1 cup hibiscus tea) to assess tolerance.\n- **Hydrate**: Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration, as diuretics increase fluid loss.\n- **Monitor**: Track blood pressure, weight, or swelling. Stop use and consult a doctor if you experience dizziness, fatigue, or irregular heartbeat (signs of electrolyte imbalance).\n- **Combine with Lifestyle**: Pair with a low-sodium diet, exercise, and potassium-rich foods (e.g., bananas) for better fluid balance.[](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/natural-diuretics)\n- **Source Quality**: Buy from reputable brands (e.g., Nature’s Way, Gaia Herbs) with third-party testing to avoid contaminants like heavy metals.[](https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/herbal-supplements-and-kidney-disease)\n\nIf you’d like specific product recommendations, dosing details, further studies, or information on combining these with other hypertension treatments (e.g., sauna, watermelon), let me know! Always seek medical advice before starting supplements, especially for chronic conditions.\n\n_Disclaimer: Grok is not a doctor; please consult one. Don't share information that can identify you._",

    "body": "Ever since I got my hands on the Derma E 0481 Anti-Wrinkle Cleanser, it’s become a part of my daily routine, and I have plenty to share. This face wash promises a powerful yet gentle cleansing formula aimed at combating aging signs, and I couldn’t resist the allure of smoother, radiant skin. Naturally, like your average skeptical user, I decided to put its claims to the test. From the first use, I knew this was not just another overhyped bottle sitting on my bathroom counter.\n\n**A Blend of Nature and Science That Works**\n\nThe formulation of this product feels like a dream come true for skincare enthusiasts. Packed with powerful antioxidants such as Vitamin A and exfoliating Glycolic Acid, the cleanser provides the much-needed surface cell renewal as promised. It’s fascinating how it not only eliminates makeup, oils, and dirt but also lives up to its anti-aging claim by targeting fine lines. The natural inclusions—Papaya extract for removing dead skin cells and Horsetail Extract to support collagen production—are fantastic additions. My skin felt deeply cleansed yet not stripped off its natural oils, which is a rarity for anti-aging cleansers. \n\n**Gentle Enough for Daily Use**\n\nWhile the product markets itself as being suitable for day and night use, I initially hesitated to use it twice daily. Over a few days, this concern proved unfounded. The gentle formula harmonized with my sensitive, combination skin. It lathers beautifully, forming a soft, cushiony foam that doesn’t feel abrasive. For those who are used to harsh exfoliants, this product could be an excellent alternative. In the evenings, after a long day, using this cleanser felt rejuvenating—you can almost sense the day’s grime melting away as you rinse it off.\n\n[Check Derma E 0481 Anti-Wrinkle Cleanser price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b003xq7a38/)\n\n**Favorable Aspects**\n\n- Non-abrasive yet effective exfoliation with Glycolic Acid and Papaya extract.  \n- Targets aging signs like wrinkles and promotes smoother skin texture.  \n- Free of harmful ingredients like parabens, sulfates, mineral oil, and GMOs.  \n- Vegan, cruelty-free, and packaged in recyclable materials.  \n\n**Packaging Could Be Improved**\n\nThe pump bottle design is functional but not without flaws. While the product is adequately dispensed, I noticed that the pump mechanism occasionally gets stuck. This creates minor frustration, especially when you’re rushing through your skincare routine. Additionally, the simplistic design of the bottle, while eco-friendly, doesn’t exactly scream premium. As someone who appreciates a visually appealing bathroom counter, I found this a tad disappointing, though it doesn’t affect the product’s performance.\n\n**Negative Attributes**\n\n- Occasional pump dispensing issues can be annoying.  \n- Plain bottle design may not appeal to aesthetically inclined buyers.  \n\n**Direct Competitors**\n\nIn comparison to other products like CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser and La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Cleanser, Derma E’s anti-wrinkle cleanser holds its own. It surpasses CeraVe when it comes to incorporating all-natural ingredients and providing a cleaner, eco-friendly formulation. However, where CeraVe impresses with its dermatologically backed affordability, Derma E may seem like a pricier alternative.\n\nAs for La Roche-Posay, the French brand’s cleansers often shine with hydration as a key feature. While the Derma E cleanser cleanses deeply and exfoliates, some might argue that it doesn’t provide the same level of hydrating benefits as La Roche-Posay’s offerings. That said, its specific anti-aging focus makes it unique in the cluttered marketplace.\n\n**Bang for the Buck**\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room—does the product justify its pricing? Despite feeling like an investment, the face wash delivers on multiple fronts. For anyone who values ethically made products with natural ingredients, you’ll feel good about spending money on it. Others who may be interested purely in performance might still balk at the cost, particularly when compared to budget-friendly competitors. However, considering that independent clinical studies claim a 97% improvement in fine lines and wrinkles for users of the Anti-Wrinkle line, the value for money stands strong.\n\nGrab [Derma E 0481 Anti-Wrinkle Cleanser at the best price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/link/b003xq7a38/)",

Both claim to provide the nutrients and support your hair needs to thrive, but which one is the better choice for you? In this detailed comparison, we'll weigh the pros and cons of Nutrafol and NourishVita to help you make an informed decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNutrafol: Nutrafol contains a diverse range of ingredients, including biotin, marine collagen, ashwagandha, tocotrienols, and more. These ingredients are selected to address not only nutrient deficiencies but also other factors like stress and inflammation that can impact hair health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNourishVita: NourishVita focuses on essential vitamins, minerals, and botanical extracts. Common ingredients include biotin, zinc, saw palmetto, and horsetail extract. It primarily aims to supply the hair follicles with nutrients for stronger hair growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMechanism:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNutrafol: Nutrafol takes a holistic approach by targeting the underlying causes of hair loss, such as stress and inflammation, in addition to providing essential nutrients. This comprehensive approach may be suitable for individuals with various hair concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNourishVita: NourishVita primarily concentrates on nourishing the hair follicles with vital nutrients, promoting hair growth from within. It's focused on addressing nutrient deficiencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFormulations:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNutrafol: Nutrafol offers different formulations tailored to specific hair concerns, such as women's hair growth or men's hair growth. This customization allows users to choose the product that aligns best with their unique needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNourishVita: NourishVita may have a more general approach, offering a single product that covers the basics of hair health.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsage:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth Nutrafol and NourishVita are typically taken as daily dietary supplements. Consistency in usage is essential for potentially experiencing improvements in hair quality over time.\n\nPrice:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrices may vary between the two products, and the cost-effectiveness depends on the specific formulation and the results you achieve.\n\nConclusion:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe choice between [Nutrafol Vs NourishVita](https://www.brandsreviews.com/NourishVita-vs-Nutrafol) ultimately depends on your specific hair concerns and preferences. If you're looking for a comprehensive solution that addresses nutrient deficiencies, stress, and inflammation, Nutrafol may be the right choice. On the other hand, if your primary concern is nutrient supply for hair growth, NourishVita could be a suitable option. Always consult with a healthcare professional or dermatologist before starting any hair supplement regimen to understand the underlying causes of your hair concerns and choose the most appropriate product. Your unique hair needs should guide your decision.",

The powerful formula of Ultra K9 Pro is made up of natural, clinically-proven ingredients that work together to support the various aspects of a dog's health, including their immune system, digestion, joint health, and energy levels.\n\nThe ingredients in Ultra K9 Pro include antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and probiotics that are carefully selected for their potency and efficacy. These ingredients are sourced from trusted suppliers and are subjected to rigorous quality control measures to ensure their purity and effectiveness.\n\n**How Does UltraK9 Pro Work?**\n\nUltraK9 Pro works by filling in your dog’s nutritional gaps. Even if you’re a good dog owner, your dog may have nutritional gaps, and those gaps could affect joint health, coat appearance, weight gain, and more.\n\nBy giving your dog a blend of natural ingredients, UltraK9 Pro can ensure your dog stays happy and healthy.\n\nEach drop of UltraK9 Pro contains a blend of 9 “primal nutrients.” Those primal nutrients include plant and herb extracts handpicked for their effects of canine health.\n\nMany of the ingredients in UltraK9 Pro are also found in human health supplements. The supplement contains astragalus root, dandelion root, ginseng, and ashwagandha, for example, among other natural ingredients.\n\nTo add flavor to the formula and make sure your dog loves it, UltraK9 Pro contains chicken bone broth. Delicious and rich, chicken bone broth is easy to digest and good for the stomach. It doesn’t just add flavor: chicken bone broth can also improve the skin, coat, and bones of your dog.\n\n[**Buy UltraK9 Pro Before it's SOLD OUT.!**](https://ultrak9-pro.promancorp.com/order-now)\n\n**What Are UltraK9 Pro Ingredients?**\n\nYour furry pals need a diet that provides them with adequate nutrients, just like humans do. They also require a variety of dietary sources, including water, protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins in their daily diet. Your dog is quite likely to become ill if this equilibrium is disrupted. Pet food manufacturers work hard to develop the ideal recipes that satisfy your pet's daily nutritional needs in order to prevent this.\n\nDietary deficiencies are mostly common in dogs and are of the most overlooked problems. Such a problem needs to be tackled in the best way possible so that dogs live a healthy and happy life. This can be combated in many ways including changing the meal plans, introducing new ingredients to the recipes, changing the whole diet, or by using supplements. The use of supplements is the easiest and most effective because there’s less chance of dogs refusing to eat food infused with supplements and also, they are less likely to show undesirable effects on the dog’s health. \n\nUltra K9 Pro is a blend of 10 special, all natural and high quality primal ingredients that provide necessary nutrition to the dogs. The following ingredients are used to create this formula:\n\n**Burdock Root:** The burdock root has been used for centuries in traditional medicine as a remedy for various ailments, such as skin problems, arthritis, and digestive issues. The abundant antioxidants found in burdock root have a number of positive health effects. Quercetin, luteolin, and other phenolic acids are examples of these antioxidants and minerals like potassium, iron, and magnesium are also found in this root. Clinical research on these antioxidants suggests that they reduce inflammation and repair damage from free radicals. \n\n**Ashwagandha:** It is a very well-known ingredient and is utilized frequently in traditional Indian medicine. It has been applied to numerous human treatments. And dogs and cats are also affected by this medical effect. When applied according to the suggested way, it poses no risks for your four-legged pals. Ashwagandha is believed to have adaptogenic properties, meaning that it can help the body to adapt to stress and promote overall well-being. According to studies on ashwagandha, it restores equilibrium, and keeps the metabolism healthy. Additionally, it encourages thyroid health and aids hormonal cleansing. \n\n**Ginseng:** It has been used for centuries in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, including improving cognitive function, reducing fatigue, and boosting immune function. It contains several active compounds, including ginsenosides, which are believed to contribute to its health-promoting effects. It also affects the adrenal gland, enhancing hormonal reactions related to metabolism, immunity, blood pressure management, and other functions. It serves as the main ingredient which promotes steady weight loss.\n\n**Astragalus root:** Also called milkvetch root, it has been utilized in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years due to its possible health advantages. It is frequently used as an adaptogen, which means that it might aid in helping the body adjust to stress and advance general health. It is thought that astragalus root may have positive effects on the immune system, cardiovascular health, and inflammation. It cleanses the body of contaminants and prevents dog urinary tract infections.\n\n**Dandelion Root:** This plant has a strong medicinal reputation, making it a desirable brand for medical procedures. It is abundant in the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants the body requires for good health. It enhances the kidney, gallbladder, and liver functions of dogs, enhancing their quality of life. It is also a source of inulin, a type of dietary fiber that can help support healthy digestion. \n\n**Turmeric:** An ingredient with analgesic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties is turmeric. It is a component of traditional eastern and western treatments, and in this composition, it helps reduce inflammation, which limits dogs' mobility. It relieves joint pressure and promotes ligament health.\n\n**MCT Oil:** The term \"MCT oil\" refers to medium-chain triglyceride oil. MCT oil may help with weight management, cognitive function, and energy levels, among other health benefits. By lowering inflammation and raising cholesterol levels, it may also promote heart health. It eases arthritis pain, promotes Turmeric qualities, and is easy to digest.\n\n**Horsetail Extract:** By increasing bone density, this herb makes bones stronger and less brittle. Horsetail extract, used in the UltraK9 pro dietary supplement, enhances teeth, improving metabolism through effective food chewing and digestion. Additionally, it strengthens bones, protecting dogs from osteoporosis as they age.\n\n**Bovine Collagen:** This is a type of protein. It is mostly composed of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline among other amino acids. It is thought to help strong bones and joints as well as healthy skin, hair, and nails. Additionally, it might enhance digestive efficiency and support intestinal health. \n\n**Chicken Bone Broth:** The broth made from whole chicken, loaded with vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. For the body to function properly, vital amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, and other nutrients must be present. These nutrients help dogs' bodies heal from inflammation, control their body temperature, and strengthen their immune systems. It is rich and delicious, stomach-friendly, easy to digest, and improves skin, coat, and bones. \n\n[**Place Your order Right Here For The Best Prices Available!**](https://ultrak9pro.healthgrowbeauty.com/order-now)\n\n**The Benefits of Ultra K9 Pro**\n\nUltra K9 Pro is a powerful supplement that supports the overall wellness of dogs.

    "body": "Varicocele, the abnormal enlargement of veins in the scrotum (pampiniform plexus), shares striking similarities with varicose veins. Here are 5 root causes to understand its underlying mechanisms.\n\n# 1. Valve Dysfunction\n\n**Root Cause:** Venous valves become incompetent, leading to retrograde blood flow and pooling.  \n**Natural Corrections:**\n\n* Compression support underwear (e.g., *Varico Health Kit* or specially designed varicocele underwear) to externally assist venous return.\n* Cold therapy (gel packs/cold showers 2–3x daily) to induce vasoconstriction and reduce valve leakiness.\n* Inversion & Leg Elevation (10–15 mins/day) to assist gravity-driven drainage.\n* Target micronutrients: Ensure high intake of vitamin C, copper, bioflavonoids to strengthen vascular connective tissue.\n\n# 2. Increased Intra-abdominal Pressure\n\n**Root Cause:** Chronic straining increases venous pressure in the scrotum, weakening the vascular structure.  \n**Natural Corrections:**\n\n* Fix constipation via magnesium citrate, psyllium husk, fermented foods, and timing your meals for smooth bowel rhythms (circadian defecation timing).\n* Avoid prolonged standing or lifting heavy with valsalva. Switch to diaphragmatic breathing during strength work.\n* Posture correction & core stability training to decompress abdominal organs and reduce pressure spikes.\n\n# 3. Anatomical Asymmetry\n\n**Root Cause:** The left testicular vein drains at a 90-degree angle into the renal vein—creating higher pressure loads.  \n**Natural Corrections:**\n\n* Left-side sleeping: Gravity assists drainage from the renal vein and reduces compression from organs.\n* Manual massage + leg elevation before bed to offload venous congestion.\n* Rebuild fascial tension: Myofascial release around the pelvic floor and lower abdomen can indirectly enhance drainage pathways.\n\n# 4. Nutcracker Syndrome\n\n**Root Cause:** Compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and SMA obstructs blood outflow.  \n**Natural Corrections:**\n\n* Repositioning therapy: Inclined sleeping (raising head of bed 3–5°) and left-side sleeping minimize vascular compression.\n* Optimize visceral fat levels: Reducing central fat mass can decompress the angle of renal vessels.\n* Postural yoga & deep abdominal decompression breathing (vacuum exercises) to reduce SMA-aorta tension.\n\n# 5. Connective Tissue Weakness\n\n**Root Cause:** Weak collagen/vascular matrix makes veins prone to dilation and failure under load.  \n**Natural Corrections:**\n\n* Boost collagen synthesis: Daily gelatin/collagen powder + vitamin C + silica (e.g., horsetail extract) stack.\n* Reduce oxidative stress: Add Varaco Health, Varaco Health II, pine bark extract (Pycnogenol), rutin, and grape seed extract for venotonic effects.\n* Stop chronic inflammation: Limit seed oils, alcohol, and sugar. Add zinc-rich animal protein to repair tissue integrity.\n* Limit frequent masturbation/porn use: High ejaculation frequency causes blood pooling and thermal stress; follow a recovery-based protocol (3–5 days abstinence between).\n\nr/TL**;DR:**  \nVaricocele isn’t random—it's a cascade rooted in structural design flaws, regulatory failure, and overload stressors. Systemic analysis helps reveal and target not just the symptoms, but the upstream pressure points.\n\nLet me know if you want a protocol next—training, recovery, and interventions can be optimized by targeting specific parameters (e.g., load reduction, venous tone restoration, systemic drainage).",

Vasodilator affects may also come from supplements, like:  \nGingko biloba  \n**L-arginine**  \nNicotine  \n(Stinging) Nettle Leaf or Extract (Also called Nettle Root)  \nHorsetail extract  \n(There are a number more, but it is hard to post them all.

I have tried two brands though, and both worked. I was just reading up on it again lately and it doesn't just improve ADHD.  It also improves mood like an antidepressant would. It is all natural so it is all I will use.\n\nIn addition,  I also eat clean keto. In studies keto (and the use of MCT oil) increases brain function. [https://www.google.com/search?q=keto+diet+improves+brain+function&rlz=1C1RXQR\\_enUS1065US1066&oq=keto+diet+improves+brain+function&gs\\_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDk2MTBqMGo5qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=keto+diet+improves+brain+function&rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1065US1066&oq=keto+diet+improves+brain+function&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDk2MTBqMGo5qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nAnyway, this mostly means clean oils like olive oil and avocados. You can also use butter, or animal fats. Anyway it is simply my experience, but the combination of eating healthier and taking some supplements, aided by medication has made me FEEL like my brain has healed itself and increased it functionality.\n\nI am now in my 40s  and I believe truly that my brain and ability to manage my emotions is now much, much better than at any other point in my life.\n\nI hope this helps and I look forward to any input others might have. Thank you.",

This **improved blood flow helps nourish the affected areas**, speeding up the healing process and promoting healthier skin and nails.\n\nFinally, the formula aids in restoring the natural microbiome balance of the skin, creating a protective barrier against future infections. This comprehensive approach makes Mycosyn Pro a promising solution for those struggling with chronic fungal issues.\n\n# Mycosyn Pro Ingredients\n\nMycosyn Pro is a dietary supplement formulated is carefully selected, all-natural ingredients, each chosen for their antifungal, immune-boosting, and skin-nourishing properties. Below is a detailed breakdown of its key ingredients and their reported benefits:\n\n# Vitamin A\n\nVitamin A is a vital fat-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in maintaining healthy skin.

Insufficient or poor skincare can cause the skin’s natural beauty to fade; today, plant extracts backed by research can help women retain the moisture their skin needs to remain beautiful.\n\nEvery woman wants to try and take the best possible care of their skin to enable them to continue looking young and radiant.

But how does this plant-based serum work, and does it have any visible benefits? Read on to learn more about what Hydrossential Serum oil can do for the health of your skin.\n\n[Hydrossential](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hydrossential2023) is a serum especially crafted for women to help them maintain flawless skin. This revolutionary formula will transform your skin and help you feel confident again. \n\nNowadays, many toxins and pollutants in the surroundings damage the outer layers of the skin and cause loss of collagen. \n\n[Hydrossential](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc) increases the collagen and elastin production necessary to achieve glowing and beautiful skin.\n\nThis serum also gets rid of wrinkles and fine lines. The age factor also plays an important role in changes that occur to the skin over time. \n\nThus, pollutants from the surroundings and the individual's age play an important role in determining skin quality. \n\nWrinkles, fine lines, discoloration of the skin, dark spots, and many other problems start to appear as we age. Hence, the Hydrossential serum works by eliminating these problems.\n\nHydrossential was crafted using ingredients in the right quantity to ensure that their properties remain intact. The serum is a game changer for women who face skin problems due to aging or other factors.\n\nThis natural and powerful formula illuminates the skin and helps it achieve a natural glow. Each serum bottle contains 30ML and lasts for at least 30 days. All you have to do is apply the product to clean skin, emphasizing the most affected areas. \n\nThis product is meant for external use only and can be used at any time of the day suitable for you.\n\n[**Get Hydrossential at the LOWEST Price Online While Supplies Last**](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc)\n\n## How Does Hydrossential Serum Oil Work?\n\nThe team behind the Hydrossential Serum oil has worked for many years on the blend and is now eager to ensure that its users will benefit from all it has to offer. Extensive studies and trials have assured it can deliver on its promises and that users can enjoy smooth, radiant, and blemish-free skin.\n\nWhile you may have already seen its benefits from the numerous commercials being aired online, we think it’s a good idea to tell you about ways in which this oil can help you. Understanding how it works and [what to expect from the Hydrossential Serum Oil](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc), and why you can’t afford to ignore it.\n\nFirstly, the Hydrossential Serum Oil makes it easier for your skin to absorb all the nutrients, ensuring your skin gets all the food it needs to become radiant. Most oils will contain the necessary nutrients to make it glow, but the skin will not absorb them, leading to wastage. The team behind this oil ensures that the body can absorb all the nutrients used in the formula.\n\nSecondly, the serum ensures that your skin surface will stay hydrated and moisturized all day long. [Skin damage](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F23f6f4n3hugu9n79c6ulwlof22.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3Dredd&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1a7G20XkUO6hvGlJHET8Sc) often begins to occur when the skin becomes parched and lacks sufficient moisture content. Lack of proper hydration will cause it to become dry, and cracked, appear wrinkly, making you look older than your actual age.\n\nThirdly, not everyone is in a position to give their skin the care it needs or deserves. Daily exposure to harmful environmental pollutants and UV rays from the sun means you have to provide it with extra care. If you aren’t in a position to do so, this serum will come to your aid and ensure that you don’t experience any additional damage.\n\nHydrossential Serum Oil will work towards reversing these damages, and you will soon start to notice a change in the appearance of scars and uneven skin tones.

This 20-in-1 formula promises superior results without compromise, and let me tell you, it delivers.\n\nWhat immediately caught my attention was its commitment to purity. Metanail is 100% free of chemical coatings and unnecessary fillers, making it a clean and effective choice for anyone concerned about what goes on their skin. Plus, being non-GMO, vegan, and gluten-free, it aligns perfectly with my lifestyle choices.\n\nBut let's talk about results. I was blown away by how quickly I noticed a difference. Within record time, my nails were stronger, healthier, and noticeably more resilient. And my feet? They've never felt smoother or looked better. It's like giving myself a spa treatment at home.\n\nWhat makes Metanail truly stand out is its powerful and natural ingredients. Witch Hazel, Scots Pine, and Horsetail Extract form a powerhouse trio that works wonders for nails and skin. Gotu Kola supports the skin's natural protective function, while ingredients like Rosemary, Pelargonium Graveolens, and Lemon Peel Extract nourish and rejuvenate.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the vitamins and antioxidants packed into this serum. Vitamin C and E are essential for collagen production, giving nails their shape and strength, while Hyaluronic Acid naturally reinforces nail integrity.\n\nI appreciate the care taken in handling these ingredients, adhering to the USDA National Organic Program in an FDA registered facility. It's reassuring to know that what I'm putting on my body meets rigorous standards.\n\nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Metanail. It's transformed my nail and feet care routine, and I'm confident it can do the same for others. While results may vary, I urge anyone considering it to give Metanail a fair chance. Trust me, your nails and feet will thank you.\n\n[Check Out Official Metanail Website](https://cutt.ly/AwVJsKOR)",

        "body": "If I had to chose one, I’d go with the first one because of the saw palmetto, nettle, and rosemary. And because it doesn’t have other crap like fragrance, for example.\n\nIn reality though, neither will probably make any difference. And on top of that you don’t know the concentrations of the ingredients.\n\nIf you can get fin/dut and min, I wouldn’t waste time, money, and more hair on this kind of things.",

    "body": "Sorry for the long post, I just feel frustrated with my hair and would appreciate any advice:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the past year I've been noticing that while my hair had a very nice healthy structure and felt soft and pleasant to touch, it would become very greasy too fast. I had to wash my hair every single day (and till the end of the day it already would look very greasy). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFew weeks ago I started using soda as a hair wash and apple vinegar as a conditioner. (I know that there is some adaptation period) I had to wash hair every day and it would feel unpleasant to touch (greasy and dusty all the time). \n\nI did it for couple weeks, but this would just frustrate me, so now i got a vegan shampoo bar from the local brand and it contains these ingredients: Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Olivate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Almondate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Shea Butterate, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Glycerin, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Thymus Vulgaris Leaf Oil, Linalool, Limonene\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile my hair feels better then after soda-vinegar (not so dusty and greasy to touch), it still doesn't feel fresh and soft (still feels a bit greasy and a bit like a straw). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes it suppose to be this way? Do I just have to be patient and wait it out? Is this just a transition period? Or just these products don't suit me? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPls share your experience and tips! Also maybe some ingredients and bar soaps that you like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
