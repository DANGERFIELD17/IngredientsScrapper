    "body": "Y‚Äôall I‚Äôm a hysterical mess right now and idk what to do. I feel like I murdered my beloved pet. \n\n\nAfter a treatments of methylene blue, epsom salts, daphnia, jungle fungus clear, and kanaplex, my boy wasn‚Äôt getting any better. Was treating him for bloat and constipation, cloudy eye, and early stage of dropsy. This was over the course of a little over a month- maybe 6 weeks.  Yesterday he stopped swimming and would just float vertically and struggled to swim, it looked painful. I figured since he‚Äôs older maybe there‚Äôs just no recovering. He‚Äôs at least 3 years old, I think he‚Äôs 3.5. \n\nLast night I was contemplating euthanasia and today I decided it was best. A very hard decision to make. \nI put 6 drops of 100% clove bud oil in a tiny jar and mixed it vigorously into a cloudy emulsion. Then used a dropper gradually add it to his hospital  tank, had 1/2 gallon of water. I thought things were going well until he moved and started gulping for air and flopped around in the tank. He was taking frantic gulps and wiggling to the surface. It looked like the oil mixture was suffocating him. \n\nHe started swimming frantically. I felt so helpless and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I knew dumping the rest of the jar would make it worse. So I waited for him rest back down and then dumped the rest of the jar in. Like 2 minutes passed by and thought he was asleep and he came up for air again and was gulping again!  I just wanted him to go peacefully.\n\nI thought about putting him in a bag in that instant and smashing him like I‚Äôve read about others doing. But I just didn‚Äôt have the heart do do it. That would have required me to scoop him out of the water , toss him in a bag, and smash him and just no. \n\nSo I thought adding another dose, this time with 10 drops,  would just make it quicker. At this point I just wanted to make it quicker for him. God this is killing me. He swam one more time and sank to the bottom and I think it‚Äôs finally done. Should I add more just to make sure? \n\nLosing my friend and buddy, and then being the cause of his traumatic death on top of it is horrible. I really loved the little guy. I just feel so horrible and deeply regret my decision.  RIP Tzar üíî\n\nEdit: wow , I am blown away with all the kind messages and support in the comments. Y‚Äôall‚Äôs comments and messages really lifted my spirits and gave me helpful information. This is a great community/subreddit of compassionate people and Betta/pet owners! I read every comment and thanks to everyone who took the time to reply with support and positivityü©∑",

Even though he had started to become lethargic recently, as soon as I introduced him to the clove oil the poor guy started thrashing violently, coming up and gulping for air desperately. Honestly I don't know if I ever cried so hard, I thought it would be a painless passing, but no, I felt like I was painfully killing him, and the little burst of energy he had while Fighting for his life made me wonder if this was all a mistake, if he could have pulled through...\n\nBut there wasn't anything else to do. Maybe the damage was done, maybe even if I put him back in his tank the clove oil would have already done too much? I just had to sit and watch him thrash and struggle for minutes. It really sucked.\n\nI don't know what the answer is. I did get my clove oil from some hokey \"essential oils\" store, but I think it claimed to be legit, real clove oil? Or perhaps I put too strong of a dose?\n\nI don't know, but I hope I don't have to do it again, or if so I may just scoop the fish out and smack him with a shovel, as awful as that sounds",

I went through a similar experience many years ago.\nWhen I got into bettas again a few years ago I read that clove oil is difficult to use with bettas. It works on the gills but bettas have their labyrinth organ as an alternative way to breathe. When they realize that they are suffocating they start to panic and try gasping for air.\nI researched and looked for an alternative as I did not want my fish to go through this. I found out that there was a fish anesthetic used by vets that I could get without a prescription. It's 100% phenoxyethanole. I've never seen anyone talk about it on this sub and I was thinking of starting a thread to spread awareness. Seeing so many posts about bad experiences with clove oil in this thread might just give me that push.\nI can confirm that phenoxyethanole works incredibly well. I've had to euthanize three fish so far with it, two were bettas. They died within seconds of being put into the euthanization container. It is recommended to use 1ml per 100ml of water for regular fish and 2ml per 100ml for bettas and corys. Apparently half the dosis can be used to anesthesize fish but I have not tried this and would recommend anyone planning to use it for that purpose to research the absolute safe dosis for their fish.\nSimilar to clove oil you need to mix the right amount of phenoxyethanole well with the water to get a solution. I simply put the fish into that solution and to be 100% sure added a more concentrated solution afterwards. I would then wait half an hour before removing the dead fish. I found this to be the most gentle and peaceful method I have ever used and would never go back to anything else.",

    "body": "Hi LUSH friends, back on here again with another haul & review! This time I‚Äôve gone for the newly released Christmas products on the app, plus some community shower gels before they‚Äôre all gone! Don‚Äôt worry, this is a Snow Fairy safe space! Warning, this is a long post. üòº\n\nThe main inspiration for this order was they finally released the perfume I‚Äôve waited so long for, Turmeric Latte! This has always been a favourite scent of mine and foolishly I only got a 30ml last year, which definitely wasn‚Äôt enough!\nOn the initial spray it is a strong cinnamon scent, with a heavy benzoin kick that works wonderfully with it. Once the smell settles and heats on your skin, the warm and lovely Cinnamon and Benzoin mixed with the Vanilla & Tonka Absolute to become a lovely, cosy and comfortable scent. \nIt feels like sitting beside a warm fire in your favourite warm pyjamas, drinking a mulled wine and listening to Christmas music. The sillage and longevity is crazy, too! I‚Äôve worn it now for most of the day and I can still strongly smell it on myself as the fragrance has subtly changed over time.\nMy number #1 favourite fragrance from LUSH and will always come strongly recommended! Limited time, so make sure you grab it before it‚Äôs gone!\n\nYou never just order one thing from LUSH though‚Ä¶ and it isn‚Äôt Xmas without Yog Nog so, of course, I had to get both the shower gel and the body spray! I‚Äôll review these together.\nThe label on the spray says ‚Äúbutterscotch, cinder toffee, clove and ylang ylang‚Äù and you can absolutely smell all of these. This scent is so absolutely delicious that I wish I could eat it. Warm, sweet, fiery, it is everything that Xmas needs to be. It lasts quite a while, too! \nIt is a similar scent profile to sticky dates in that it is very sweet, with less of that cloying sweetness though and more a bold mixture of darker and warmer fragrances working together to be complex and moreish. Definitely similar to a big bag of cinder toffee on bonfire night!\n\nThe ingredients on the shower gel are much the same, with a few changes. There is Maple Syrup, Fine Sea Salt, Gardenia Extract, Titanium Dioxide for the colour, and of course, tons of plastic free and vegan glitter to give it the signature look of molten gold. Be careful to rinse your tiles and bath after! \nThe smell is very similar, just a little more dilute as there is no alcohol, but I found really amazing results using this and then the spray on my body afterwards once I‚Äôd dried! It smelled a great deal stronger than just doing one alone.\nIt‚Äôs very moisturising too, I felt very soft and smooth after. Definitely one I plan to use in the evenings before a nice sleep. Sorry, Sleepy Shower Gel! You‚Äôve got a new competitor.\n\nContinuing with shower gels and spicy scents, Skinny Dip is a very different scent to how I imagined! It‚Äôs actually delicious and warm. I assumed it would smell a bit lighter but it‚Äôs very bold!\nThe main ingredients for the scent are Clove Bud Oil, cold-pressed Murumuru butter, Coconut Infusion, Cedarwood Oil, Clary Sage Oil, Palmarosa Oil, Vetivert Oil & Ylang Ylang Oil! Definitely a bold and complicated scent profile which explains why I can‚Äôt place it to anything else, but it‚Äôs definitely warm and spicy! Sincerely hoping this becomes a permanent addition to the range.\n\nFinally, we‚Äôve got Sultana, based on the classic Sultana of Soap! On the ingredients we have Apricot Infusion, Currant Infusion, Cranberry Infusion, Olibanum Oil & Bergamot Oil.\nThis is a very fruity but mature scent. Think less ‚Äúfruit cocktail on the beach‚Äù and more ‚Äúfancy restaurant dessert with a fruity, currant reduction‚Äù as that‚Äôs how it feels to smell! Not overly bright smelling, but still sweet and cleansing. \n\nThanks for reading, hope you enjoyed my thoughts on these products! Please do comment if you get them too, I‚Äôd love to know how you feel!",

Merril and I are both musicians, and we celebrated Valentine's Day on the road, playing a run of shows up through Chicago and back home. The kids have had back to back snow days, and the washer and dryer are full of sledding clothes. These are the good days, y'all. Hope everyone is well!\n\nNow, for the weekly beard education post!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnless you're some kind of Adonis, or a full blown beard model, chances are your beard isn't completely perfect. Almost every single beard has at least one weak spot, an issue, or something that could be better. Maybe you‚Äôve got a patchy area that won‚Äôt fill in, your beard is wiry and uncooperative, or you're shedding a ton of hair. In any of these cases, you‚Äôre not alone. Every beard has something. The trick is figuring out what‚Äôs causing the issue and addressing it with proper knowledge.\n\nLet‚Äôs break down some of the most common issues dudes come to these subs looking to address.\n\n**Patchy Areas That Won‚Äôt Fill In**\n\nThis is one of the most common early beard struggles, and it‚Äôs also one of the main reasons guys give up early and shave it off. You get stoked about growing a beard, and as it starts coming in, you notice holes, hairless spots, and parts that don't connect.  This makes you feel a bit insecure, and makes the beard look messy. You might lose hope that it will ever fill in.\n\nThe cause:  Sometimes this is just a timing issue. In the early stages of growth, patchiness is fairly common. Some parts of your face have fewer follicles than others, and some follicles take longer to activate, or grow at different speeds. Later in the journey, you might deal with issues like inflammation or lack of proper hydration that can slow growth and diminish follicle function.\n\nNote: A big mistake guys make is shaving to \"make it grow thicker.\" This doesn't work. It's a myth. Your beard will keep growing in the same way no matter how many times you shave it off.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nGive it time. Some beards just take longer to fill in than others.\n\nDevelop and practice a good skincare routine. Wash your face daily with a gentle cleanser. Avoid harsh soaps.\n\nIncrease blood flow to the skin to activate follicles and keep them working at their best. This is done through exfoliation and vasodilation. An exfoliator brush and a gentle scrub is invaluable. A firm boar bristle brush performs \"scritching\", which clears pores and brings blood to the surface of the skin. Common vasodilators are peppermint oil, rosemary oil, cinnamon bark oil, ginger oil, eucalyptus oil, clove bud oil, black pepper oil, castor oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, MSM, and vitamin B12.\n\nMany beard oils, combined with a good skincare routine, can eliminate inflammation AND increase blood flow to the follicle, while also supporting their function.\n\nReducing inflammation removes the roadblock. Increasing blood flow steps on the gas. This dual approach ensures that the whole beard, including the patchy areas, grows at its best. You'll see this start to fill in as quickly as genetically possible.\n\n**Wild, Wavy, and Uncooperative Beard Hair**\n\nWe see this every single day. One side grows up, the other side grows down, and the middle grows sideways. There's a whole ocean worth of waves in the center, and a split down the middle. This is where a lot of guys start thinking they just have a bad beard when really, they just have an untamed one.\n\nSome beards naturally grow in straight and lay easily and uniformly, but for most of us, the beard has a mind of its own.\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes you can make in this case is trying to fight against these types of issues with force. Using heat or waxes to force your beard to lay a certain way is unlikely to work, and is likely only going to create more problems.\n\nHair that grows in wild has all sorts of names, depending on the pattern. Vertical growth, reverse growth, upward grain, against the grain, whorls, cowlicks, swirls, vortex growth, helical growth. So many terms for hair that just doesn't do what it should.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nThe best thing you can do to address this is start by relaxing the hair. We talked in the last section about the keratinized scales on the cuticle of the hair. When they're standing, the hair is TOUGH to maintain. It goes every which way, it's wiry, it's brittle, and it can bend wherever it wants to go.\n\nA beard oil rich in penetrating fatty acids will smooth down the cuticle layers, absorb into the cortex, soften and relax the hair to increase ease of maintenance quickly. Then, you begin mechanical training. Just like you brush your hair to train a part into it, or to \"teach\" it to lay a certain way, you comb and brush your beard daily to establish new normal patterns. When your hair starts to adapt to these new patterns, THEN you can incorporate balm or butter to reinforce your training. Balms that contain lanolin or pine tar are extra helpful in training.\n\nAvoid the urge to trim to cut out problem spots. Let it grow longer. More length = more weight = more control.\n\nit takes patience and consistency, but you can establish a healthy, relaxed uniform beard with regular care!\n\n**Stalled Growth Or Constant Shedding**\n\nA lot of guys hit a wall where their beard just stops getting longer. Sometimes that‚Äôs terminal length, meaning that‚Äôs just how long your beard is genetically programmed to grow. But most of the time, the hair is just breaking as fast as it‚Äôs growing.\n\nPoor circulation, lack of nutrients, and even rancid beard oils can slow down follicle activity. If your beard has stayed the same length for months, it‚Äôs likely not because it won‚Äôt grow, but because something is interfering.\n\nA bit of shedding is normal, but an over excess of shedding is caused by the same things that stall growth. A healthy follicle anchors the hair properly and will hold onto it for a full cycle. But if the follicle is weak or inflamed, it will often push the hair bulb out and shut down.\n\nHow to fix it:\n\nMake sure your beard oil is fresh. Rancid oils increase breakage and shut down follicles.\n\nUse oils and supplement sprays with castor oil and sulfur donors (like MSM) to strengthen follicles and reinforce their function.\n\nBe gentle when brushing. Ripping through tangles can cause unnecessary hair loss.\n\nUse good beard oil to impart nutrients that increase the strength of the hair to reduce breakage.\n\nTrim split ends, avoid over-washing, and don't use too much beard product. Stick to non-comedogenic oils and pay attention to your skin for signs of clogged pores and inflammation.\n\nEXFOLIATE. VASODILATE. HYDRATE.\n\nEliminate all the things that stall growth and reduce follicular function and you can easily overcome the stall, reduce shedding, and get back to growth. Also make sure to believe in yourself REAL hard. It helps.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nEvery beard has some kind of issue. You are far from alone with yours. Stop stressing about it and trying to force your beard to behave a certain way. Instead, take a deep breath and figure out what it actually needs.\n\nPatchy cheeks? *Activate dormant follicles.*\n\nUnruly growth? *Work with your beard, not against it.*\n\nStalled growth? *It‚Äôs breaking as fast as it‚Äôs growing.*\n\nShedding? *Your follicles are not getting what they need.*\n\nMost beard problems aren‚Äôt genetic curses at all. They‚Äôre just signs that your beard needs better care. Now go fix it!\n\nBeard strong, y'all!\n\n\\-Brad",

    "body": "So LUSH'S Caca Henna bars come up as a topic here quite often, and like many of the seasoned henna users here I've had a negative view of it. I always viewed it as extremely overpriced considering it was full of filler like butters and fragrance products. However, right before Thanksgiving, I found myself totally out of my standard henna powder. I can buy more while visiting my family but figured in the meantime, I'd go ahead and give Lush a shot as a holdover and a conditioning treatment. \n\nI bought **Caca Rouge** since I just use regular red henna and did NOT want to go any darker than my usual formula. My natural hair is platinum blonde and I had almost an inch of root showing. The regular henna brands I have used are Nupur, Mumtaz, Rainbow, and Karishma (my fave)\n\n**THE PREP:** My usual henna routine is to mix the powder in water and one squirt of conditioner in a ceramic microwave soup bowl with sealing lid, then leave overnight, then mix and freeze in a plastic bag until I'm ready to thaw it out and use it. \n\nThe Lush henna directions say to chop up the block that it comes in, put the pieces in a \"bain-marie,\" and pour boiling water over it. Not being French or a gourmet chef, I opted to instead put it in a fondue pot with room temperature water covering all pieces and wait for it to melt. It didn't take very long and I eventually ended up with something that resembled my usual henna texture. The block's texture reminds me of very very old chocolate and was pretty easy to chop small. \n\nI do like that Lush henna gives you the option to dye your hair at a moment's notice without having to have some pre-prepared frozen henna. That is a lot more convenient.\n\nLet me take this moment to say something about the **smell**. The regular smell of henna is very strong and has always reminded me of grass and something a little metallic. Lush describes their henna as smelling like \"a spice market,\" whatever that means. There is definitely a henna undertone to the smell, but it also smells *very* strongly of something that is not henna. I cannot put my finger on what it is that it smells like, it's some kind of herb or spice, but it's not the usual henna smell. Lush lists clove bud oil as main component, so maybe it's that?? I wasn't a fan myself, but my husband hates the smell of regular henna, so it's all personal taste\n\n**THE APPLICATION:** My usual henna routine is to sit the thawed bag back into the ceramic bowl and use a cheap brush that came in a Sally Beauty hairdye kit to apply it while sectioning the hair into thin sections. For a thicker paste I use a metal spoon to apply. It's inelegant but efficient. For the Lush henna, I started with the brush since the paste was the right texture. (my hair was damp and freshly shampooed without conditioner)\n\nDouble-checking the directions after it was all over, I realized that a crucial part of the Lush henna is to **keep it warm the entire time***.* I don't have space on my bathroom counter where I could have safely put my fondue pot, even if I had realized I should have. That is a big problem.\n\nOnce the henna started cooling to the point where it didn't feel obviously warm on my head, it also started to get **MESSY.** It was crumbling all over the place and falling off the brush. I put in a little more water, which did not help. I was about 2/3rds done with my head at this point and was having to stop after every section to clean up the counter and floor. It began to feel less like yogurt and more like wet, sandy mud. I eventually just completely gave up, tilted my head over the bathtub, grabbed the rest of it with my bare hands and slathered it on as best I could. Once I had wrapped my whole head in  saran wrap and topped it with an old t-shirt, I had to rinse myself off to get all the crumbs and grains off. Usually a quick swipe with a damp paper towel is enough.\n\n**THE WASHOUT:** I left the henna in for two hours. I usually sleep overnight with henna in, hence the old t-shirt, but as I have fine and thin hair I was concerned about how oily Caca Rouge could be to wash out. Usually it doesn't take me that much longer to wash out in the shower, I can do it before work without impacting my routine.\n\nThe washout was just as messy as the application. Once again I was reminded of very sandy mud. It reminded me a lot of my experience with Rainbow henna, which I also found to be extremely grainy, but Lush henna was even worse and definitely oily. I used a plastic scalp stimulator brush to try and loosen up the paste on my scalp and used a wide-tooth comb to work out what was in my hair, but I still had to double-shampoo to get everything out. I was pretty disappointed; I don't like to shampoo vigorously after henna because I feel like it leads to some fading and color loss. I followed it up with conditioner per directions.\n\nFor what it's worth, unlike Rainbow, I did not see a lot of color bleeding when I wrung my hair out of the shower. Rainbow was the wooooooorst with bleeding.\nEDIT: This has since changed. I rinsed my hair without shampooing the morning after henna application and wring-out was dark orange. However I imagine that shampooing would have prevented this a bit.\n\n**THE COLOR PAYOFF:** Honestly, just looking at the immediate result, it is a lot stronger than I expected! I was fully prepared for the roots to be still noticeably lighter than the rest of my hair. They are a little lighter when wet, but once it is dry you really can't tell. It'll be interesting to see how the color deepens over the next couple days and whether or not there is fading. My hair smells more strongly of that other scent rather than henna, which my husband is a big fan of. Can't tell if there was any particular moisturizing effect. Edit: my hair is definitely super soft!\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS:** Due to the very high cost, the tedious prep process, the temperature requirement, and the grainy/sandy texture, I would still not recommend Lush henna for users new to henna. I think it would be extremely difficult to achieve consistent application over the entire head without making a massive mess. I also would not recommend it for people with thick hair or very long hair since you would use up a lot of the block at once, and it's much more expensive than any of the other brands I've tried. Literally 10x the price of one bag of Karishma!!\n\nHowever, for people who need a holdover or touchup root treatment, like I did, I think it's fine to use. If you aren't really a big fan of the henna smell, you'll probably like this formulation. I don't know if I will buy another block after this one, but it's good to know that I have this as an option if I ever run out again and need something in a pinch.",

I usually also add a little coffee if I have any left over. I make it runny enough to drip off the dye brush and apply it like you started to. \n\nAnother comment is that I use hair conditioner in the shower to help remove it. Impossible to get out other wise. I condition/rinse at least 2x, but no shampoo until the next day. This leaves a little residual henna in my hair but I want it to keep darkening and not strip it all out right away.",

        "body": "Lush Caca Rouge is the first and only henna I‚Äôve tried so far! Some tips for anyone reading this:\n\n-lay some newspaper or an old towel down on the floor where you are going to apply \n\n-prepare it in a heat safe bowl sitting in a simmering pot of water till it‚Äôs the consistency of runny yogurt, so it drips off the spoon. You can use water, tea coffee etc depending on what you prefer. Make sure the henna isn‚Äôt too hot when you apply it though\n\n-if you‚Äôre like me & have a bathroom with a sink and a mirror above it, apply the henna here. Fill your sink with hot water and place the bowl of henna in the water to keep it warm, you can also add some of this water to the henna if it‚Äôs starts to dry out! This is really the best way to keep it a good consistently imo \n\n-forget the brushes and applicators! I just wear tight fitting latex gloves, scoop up the henna and work it in like shampoo as quickly as I can üòÖ I start with my roots first and work outwards and downwards, making sure I use enough henna so really saturate my hair so it won‚Äôt be patchy. Like op says- it gets crumbly when it cools\n\n-leave it in for a long time if you want a strong colour, someone suggested to me that the colour might be diluted due to the butters etc? It‚Äôs always been strong for me but then I do it in the morning and just leave it in all day on a housework day lol \n\nHope this helps! I would definitely recommend lush henna if you get dry hair as it‚Äôs a bit like a deep conditioner treatment at the same time. It always makes my hair shiny and soft! \n\nAnd yes that smell is clove oil!",

It keeps the mix warm and easy to apply.\nI use a cheap natural fibre paint brush. The sort you use to do edging. I find it is much less prone to flicking the mix all over my bathroom.\nIf it starts to get dry/crumbly, I run new hot water into my sink and stir until the mix is warm and smooth again.\nI use a ratio of 3 x grams to 5 x millilitres. I have short hair, so I use 60 grams henna block to 100 millilitres hot water about every 4 weeks. This is enough to do my roots and massage into my ends.\nI wrap my head in cling film, and usually wrap it in a towel turban style. This keeps my head and the henna warm, and I find it a lot easier to rinse out.",

Nothing killed enough of the mites to eradicate them.  I think it is pretty obvious the we have resistant scabies mites.  I have read several scientific articles about clove oil being able to kill mites that have become resistant to most if not all of current medications (pesticides). If you would like to read about the studies done please go to r/scabiesfacts\n\nThere is little to no info on dosing your skin with clove oil but there are a number of reddit members that are now experimenting with clove oil. I am on day 6 using 2 parts olive oil mixed with 1 part clove oil. For your delicate private areas you must use a more dilute solution!!!  Also keep in mind that every brand and maybe every bottle could be a different strength.  Do a skin patch test with every bottle.  If you get a mixture on your skin that is too strong, simply wash it off with soap and water, then remix and try again. You could also have a little harmless burn feeling that goes away in a minute. Of course do not get it in your eyes. I accidentally did and it hurt like the devil. Be sure to mix the clove oil with an oil carrier because oil mixes best with oil.  Human skin loves olive oil and it will not give you pimples so that would be my number one choice.\n\nI have been posting for six days about clove oil because it has been killing the mites! I am feeling sooo much better.  I am also posting because I know that there are people on these reddit sites that do not have health insurance and therefore no access to health care professionals.  You do not need a prescription for clove oil.  I am using SVA organic Clove Bud Oil from amazon because I can get it in a 4oz bottle.  BE CAREFUL with clove oil it is strong!  Good luck to all of you fighting scabies.",

I‚Äôd been let down by similar products before, but something about Pronail Complex‚Äôs natural ingredient list and positive reviews caught my attention. I decided to give it a shot, and what followed was a journey that completely changed how I view nail care.\n\nIn this review, I‚Äôll share my firsthand experience with Pronail Complex‚Äîwhat it is, how it works, and whether it lives up to the hype. If you‚Äôre like me and have been searching for a solution to weak, brittle nails, this might just be the answer you‚Äôve been looking for. Let‚Äôs get started!\n\n# What is Pronail Complex?\n\nPronail Complex is a topical spray designed to improve nail health by targeting common issues like brittleness, peeling, and slow growth.

My Personal Experience\n\nWhen I first heard about Pronail Complex, I‚Äôll admit I was skeptical. I‚Äôve tried countless nail treatments in the past‚Äîcreams, polishes, supplements‚Äîand none of them delivered the results they promised.\n\nSo, when I came across Pronail Complex, I decided to give it a fair shot, but with realistic expectations. After using it consistently for a month, here‚Äôs my honest take:\n\n**My One-Month Experience with Pronail Complex**\n\n**Week 1**:\n\nI started using Pronail Complex as directed‚Äîspraying it on my nails 2-3 times a day, especially after showering. The first thing I noticed was how lightweight and non-greasy the formula felt. It absorbed quickly, and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about sticky residue or staining my socks. Within a few days, my nails felt slightly smoother, but I didn‚Äôt see any dramatic changes yet.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\nBy the second week, I began to notice small improvements. My nails, which were usually prone to peeling and breaking, felt stronger. I didn‚Äôt experience any new breaks, which was a big win for me. The skin around my nails also felt softer and more hydrated, thanks to the moisturizing oils in the formula.\n\n**Week 3**:\n\nThis is when I started to see visible changes. My nails looked shinier and healthier, and the white spots that had been bothering me for months began to fade.\n\nI also noticed that my nails were growing faster than usual, and the edges weren‚Äôt as jagged or uneven.\n\n**Week 4**:\n\nAfter a full month of use, I can confidently say that Pronail Complex has made a noticeable difference. My nails are stronger, smoother, and less prone to breakage. The fungal issues I had been dealing with (yellowing and thickening) also improved significantly. While my nails aren‚Äôt perfect yet, the progress I‚Äôve seen in just four weeks is impressive.\n\n# Is Pronail Complex Legit?\n\nBased on my experience, Pronail Complex is definitely not a scam. It‚Äôs a legitimate product that delivers real results when used consistently.

    "body": "TL;DR: Taking neem leaf\\* internally is what I think healed me.\n\n\\*not oil\n\nI'm pretty sure I had scabies, and I healed primarily with NEEM.  (I will leave a comment with more details about my symptoms and how I think I contracted the mites.)\n\nThe exposure was end of July 2023, symptoms started mid-August, I think I was healed by beginning of September, but I could confidently declare it so at the beginning of October (after going through \"post\" stuff.)  So I'm writing this now three months out.\n\nI think I caught the infestation early, and I don't know if that has any bearing on the efficacy of my treatment, but I personally think neem is worth a try.  It's a healing herb that is also said to help with digestion and other things.  For me, it curbed sugar cravings, too.\n\nWhat I did:  Took Nature's Way Neem Leaf capsules internally.  NOT THE OIL.  One every four hours, including when I'd wake up in the middle of the night.  (The bottle said to take two, but I only took one at a time.)  I also spot-treated with topical neem oil mixed 1:1 with coconut oil. \n\nI want to say I did this for maybe 14 days at the most, and then I was fine (except for still terrified, and still getting random itches that would come and go within 48 hours or so.  I assume that was \"post\" stuff.)  I don't know how long you should take the capsules.  I guess until you feel you don't need to anymore.  That's what I went on.  I think you could safely take them for quite a bit longer than 14 days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore specifics:\n\n\\- Sometimes I would mix clove bud or tea tree essential oils with the neem/coconut oil.\n\n\\- Once-in-a-while I'd use aloe vera topically\n\n\\- I got the neem oil first, so I started my treatment off applying neem/coconut oil from toes to chin before bed.  The first time, I woke up with a lot more itchiness, including my scalp.  So the next two nights, I applied it head-to-toe.  For my hair, I mixed neem oil and water in a spray bottle and applied liberally.\n\n\\- I was freaked out about the cleaning aspect.  I have other priorities in life.  I also deal with chronic health issues and fatigue, so cleaning is not something I have a lot energy to devote to.  I decided to just do my best, and if that wasn't good enough, I'd do more.\n\n* I got a mattress cover.  I would spray that with water mixed with clove bud oil sometimes.\n* I dried my sheets and blankets every day, but didn't wash them excessively\n* Same with clothes.  Dried them and/or put them in a tote for a week\n* Tried to vaccuum every few days\n* Covered my computer chair (main place I sit) with plastic.  Wiped it down the first week or so, then said fuck it.\n* I'd just bought a hammock for my balcony and fell in love with it.  It was summer and now I was stuck at home in isolation.  No way was I going to go three days between using it.  It maybe got morning sunlight on it, so perhaps that helped, but I didn't worry about cleaning it.  Well, I worried, but I didn't clean it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I did take a couple homeopathic remedies once or twice--Ledum Palustre, Antimonium Crudum, and I use Bach Flower Essences regularly.  Crab Apple is a good one for this issue.  But NEEM is the main thing I used, and the main thing I credit with overcoming scabies.\n\n\\- Mindset was important, and I did my best to be as positive as possible.  I'm by no means the most optimistic person, in fact, I've spent most of my life in dark places, but I just tried to breathe, have faith, and take it all in stride.  I tried not to go too far down the internet rabbithole on scabies, but I certainly had my moments when I couldn't help but feel the need to gather information.  I just asked to a higher power that it be helpful and healing.  Your belief system might be different from mine, but this is my post, and that's what I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis feels like a long post, so I guess I'll save anything else for the comments, or answering your questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope some part of this information helps you.",

        "body": "I feel like someone out there is going to want more \"proof\" that I really had scabies.  I don't know what else it could have been.  I was in the car with someone for three hours.  The entire backseat was full of their belongings, because they were moving house.  Additionally, they'd been transporting family members in the passenger seat where I sat.  The next week, they told me they'd all been dealing with scabies.  Like, they already had it and knew it when they offered me the ride and sat talking to me in the car for three hours.  \r  \n\r  \nI told myself over and over I wouldn't get it, I couldn't get it from the car upholstery or whatever.  I basically convinced myself I'd be fine.  But, sho' nuff, three weeks after being in that car, I got an itch that wouldn't go away, and it itched in a way I hadn't experienced before.  A week after that, another one.  Then another.  I started treating probably within two weeks of the first itch (I was still in denial for a while.)  \r  \n\r  \nAll the itches eventually subsided with treatment, but the initial spot was more finicky.  I think it's still even a little sensitive, three or four months later.  \r  \n\r  \nSo, yeah, I don't know what else would have caused persistent itchiness out of the blue AFTER EXPOSURE TO SCABIES, respond to treatment FOR SCABIES, then have symptoms akin to \"post scabies\".",

    "body": "Yesterday I bought a diffuser and some essential oils. I started to read online about essential oils and how to diffuse them, just to learn about them and learn about other oils, I could use to benefit my health.\n\nDoing the research, I kept finding pages after pages of the dangers of essential oils when misused. I‚Äôm afraid that I might be allergic to an oil, or that my body might react to an oil. Does anybody have any advice on this?\n\n---- UPDATE ----\n\nOkay, so after having almost 5k views, I started reading a little bit more. Because of a fear I just didn't want to read anything. But I did! So here are some points I want to share:\n\n1) Ingestion:\n\nAs a general rule, you should keep concentration levels of essential oils below 5 percent. What does this mean? Dose is the most important factor in essential oil safety.\n\nEssential oil concentrations range from 1-20%. Volumes of 5-15 mL are likely to cause toxicity in adults. Smaller ingestions of 2-3 mL of some essential oils have been associated with toxicity in children. - (Clinical Practice Guidelines‚ÄØ: Essential Oil Poisoning, n.d.)\n\nAnd do you know how many drops of essential oil are in 1ml? 20 drops. 20 un-diluted drops!\n\n2) Concentration Levels:\n\nAs a general rule, you should keep concentration levels of essential oils below 5 percent. Diluting at 1 percent is equivalent to adding 6 drops of essential oil, so 30 drops is 5%. And this is in reference of Un-Diluted, mind you. \n\nWhen you dilute the oil in water, you literally balance the concentration out, allowing you to use the oil as freely and calmly as you wish. It is the diluting that allows you to use it as safely as possible, and the benefits are great.\n\n3) Dilution Levels on skin:\n\nAccording to the Tisserand Institute, certain essential oils have specific dilution needs to avoid the risk of skin allergy or phototoxicity. For instance, Clove Bud oil should be used at no more than 0.5%, Holy Basil oil can be used up to 1%, Lemon oil should be used at no more than 2%, and Grapefruit oil can be used up to 4%.\n\nThese percentages relate to skin application in case you desire to enjoy the oils in this manner. It requires more care but it is likewise a beneficial use. \n\nNOW Foods provides a detailed dilution chart and calculator for essential oils. They recommend not using undiluted essential oils on your skin. For facial applications such as masks or oils, a 1% or less dilution is recommended. For massage oils and other leave-on body products, they recommend a 2% dilution, and for other rinse-off bath and body products, they recommend 3%.\n\nLINK: https://www.nowfoods.com/healthy-living/articles/diluting-essential-oils\n\n4) Inhaling Oils:\n\nThis category can be divided into three different health risks:\n\na) The intensity of the Symptom\nb) The intensity of the oil when not properly diluted\nc) Diffuse intermittently\n\nSo, let's go through each one briefly:\n\na) The intensity of the Symptom - Believe it or not, even though some websites talk about having life threatening reactions from inhaling it is just not possible. The intensity of symptoms when it comes to aromatherapy is low; for example: Nausea, headaches, dizziness, or even irritation of the throat or nose are the symptoms you can expect from it. (Pugle, 2019) of course this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be careless now.\n\nb) The intensity of the oil when not properly diluted - Basically, if you use 100ml of water only, and you add about 20 drops! You're not doing this right. The potency of the oil will be too strong and can lead you to experience the symptoms above (symptom intensity can be worse depending on the oil). Make sure to have more than 100ml of water and no more than 5 drops to be safe. (Though I'm still reading about this part)\n\nc) Diffuse intermittently - Again, because you are going to be inhaling diluted oils it's good to give your nose and breathing a break from time to time. 30-60 minutes is enough. \n\nIn fact, with just 30 min. of inhaling the oils you receive the benefits of the oil. So you don't need 3-6hrs like some people say in youTube. Don't go hard with oils, go slow and easy. \n\n---- DONE ----\n\nThat's it! I'm still going to be reading about this because I really love this topic. If something is incorrect please let me know so I can look it up and adjust accordingly.",

Is it possible to achieve that color with henna? I spoke to an older friend (she's in her mid to late 40s) who went to beauty school aaages ago and she wasn't sure if I could.\n\n2. Does adding teas and spices really help the color? What ones would you suggest for my goal, and how much would you suggest using?\n\n3. I'm planning on purchasing Lush Caca Rouge, if you have any experience with that product, would you or are you using it again?\n\nIngredients: Red Henna (Lawsonia inermis) , Fair Trade Cocoa Butter (Theobroma cacao) , Fresh Lemon Juice (Citrus limonum) , Powdered Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) , Clove Bud Oil (Eugenia caryophyllus) , *Citral , *Eugenol , *Geraniol , *Citronellol , *Limonene , *Linalool , Perfume\n\n4. I have the nape of my neck pierced, would the henna cause problems if it came in contact with it? I've never had a reaction to chemical dyes.\n\nAny tips, or break downs of how your experiences would be gratefully appreciated! \n\noh, also posted similar in r/hair but got just one response, thought you guys might be better able to help.",

I loved it SOOO much. \n\nI would recommend getting pure body art quality henna & mixing it yourself, though. I got mine at Henna sooq. Also Amazon- look for Jamila. I also bought one that claims to be more red, it's called  Red Raj. I'm not really sure of the differences because I would mix jamila, red raj, and cassia (yellow) I wanted the coppery red, & got it! I'd post a pic but I'm on mobile. \n\nIt made my hair feel GREAT and I recommend it- IF you are okay with the permanence. Henna cannot be bleached out, and trust me- I tried. It can't. It can probably be covered with dark brown semi-perm dye, but the red shines through as far as I can tell. This is a bigger commitment that dying your hair any other way. \n\nI used tazo passion tea (bright red) and lemon juice, it's hard to tell if it really makes a difference. \n\nThe mixture is grainy mud. It's odd & smells like horses. I can't imagine it would irritate your piercing unless grains got in there. If but a bandaid over it while you apply & rinse just to avoid that. \n\nMan, now I wanna go make a batch! I recently shaved my head & have just a couple inches of light brown hair. Boring!",

In my opinion, it's better to get a friend and mix up some fresh body art quality (BAQ) henna and apply that instead.  \n\nNo, unless it was open and bleeding, nothing should bother the piercing, and even if it was open and bleeding it shouldn't aggravate it.

If you go into your local Lush, they should give you a sample so you can strand test it on the different coloured sections of your hair.  If you want it redder, wrap the strand test in cling film and if you want a darker tone, leave it open as it will oxidise and go a bit darker.  Leave it on for 2 1/2 hours. If you don't like the colour, you can dye it immediately again.  Plus the hennas contain cocoa butter which leaves your hair super soft.  \n\nThe ingredients in the Lush hennas have been done perfectly so you don't have to add any teas etc to it although some people still do.\n\nFor the neck piercing, it shouldn't be a problem (unless it's new) and so you don't get staining, use Lush Ultrabalm around your hairline.\n\nJust a little note;if your hair goes green or orange, don't panic, just immediately dye it again!  The reaction of the chemical hair dye is unpredictable hence the strand test. Chemical hair dye goes under the hair cuticle whilst henna coats it so it's a lot kinder to the hair.\n\nI've worked for Lush for 4 years and I've been trained in haircare :) \n\nHope this helps!",

    "body": "Hi all! I am relatively new to the DIY fragrance world. I have already finished reading a few books on the subject and recently I purchased my first set of ingredients.  \nCurrently I am in the process of learning more about my recent purchases. I got a bit confused when it comes to one of them - Clove Bud Essence (SFE). How different it is from Clove Bud Oil? I found separate entries for both of them on thegoodscentscompany website, but while there is a lot of information provided on clove bud oil, clove bud essence page is missing most of them (e.g. recommendation for usage level, for which I was looking for).   \nOn other website I read that essences are less fragrant than essential oils and typically used for flavoring, but I think it is not the case here (I ordered it from a store specializing in perfume ingredients). Although if essence is weaker than essential oil in this case, then could that change the \"type\" of note Clove Bud Essence is? Clove Bud Oil is described as a heart note, so would that make essence a top note?   \nI'll be extremely grateful for all the answers, as this differentiation is still quite mysterious to me.",

So I got out the clove oil and added drops of clove oil/water shaken up in a seperate container to the Tupperware container with my betta in it. I did this in about 5 drop intervals for about an hour and nothing changed, except Riptides breathing slowed down. He swam a little so I knew he somehow wasnt asleep yet. So I took out some water from the bin, added more the the mixture of clove oil/water, and kept going at smaller time intervals. I thought he was dead and then he would struggle to get up to breathe, repeat. Ofc by now I had been spending a couple of hours on this supposedly quick, painless, and easy process, and I was getting emotional. Finally, my dad took care of poor Riptide the harsh way. This was incredibly stressful and heartbreaking to experience, and I still dont know what went wrong. I used 100% clove bud oil. \n\nSorry about the rant. Can anyone relate? What happened?",

You would inhale it in the same way as normal air, your sedated and unconscious self continues to take breaths of the gas and you quickly overdose on the sedative and just never wake up right. \n\nWell, the biggest issue with your scenario is Bettas take their air in from the surface! Meaning the mixture of water/oil was likely rather just a bit of an uncomfortable bath for him and the clove oil would never have truly affected him the way you'd intended in about an hours time. Now I won't say that if you'd kept him in the mixture for a full 24 hour period he'd still be awake but there's a shot he would still be kickin\n\nOf course, that's my take on it. Clove oil to this day is still being researched for how, what, and why it has the affect it does on fish so effectively. To me, this was just applied logic and im hoping it eases your mind 2 years later to know that you likely did nothing wrong, it just was not as an effective method for the species.",

(But in that case please tell me what kind of alcohol, and how to proceed).\nI stupidly added some clove bud oil to a PG/VG mixture, and assumed it would be safe (and would help me with a toothache :)). Yes yes, i know, \"don't assume, it makes ....\"\n\nMint leaves? Jasmine flowers? A girlfriend's sweat? :)\n\nPlease don't reply to this honest-if-naive question with something clever about the meaning of \"found in nature.\" I agree that by definition everything that actually exists exists in nature. Landfill exists in nature (Would that it didn't!); if the enriched uranium found in the centrifuges in Iran exists, it exists in nature -- but these are not examples of what I'm looking for. \"You know what I mean.\"\n\nThank you, and my apologies if there is a well known list. Neither Google reddit search found one for me.\n\nEDIT: For some reason the app is not letting me reply to anyone's comments. So I'll just say it here: I can assure jasone414 that my post is perfectly sincere. \n\nI wrote an edit to this post which I now understand was just pretentious and stupid, apologies to anyone who read it.  What i understand from the replies so far is that flavour extraction of itself a highly skilled business, and so the work isn't to \"do it yourself,\" it's to find highly skilled suppliers. Actually, that sounds to me a bit like whiskey or wine. (Hmmm, can one vape Scotch? I'm search that next, sounds nice to me)\n\nI'm pretty sure that what I want are \"single\" ketones, esters and terpenes -- can i call them KETs?  So I'll ask here if there  are safe and unsafe KETs? Or are all safe ( just some are going to be repulsive, of course. Also, I might feel awkward that people would think I'm misogynistic if i said that \"I'm vaping an ester.\" :)).\n\n(And yes, i did see that post about vaping jizz ( did he say if it was his own lol?), but for reasons I'm too modest to explain in detail, i think that my partner might object :).",

These mechanisms include:\n\n* Cell Membrane Disruption: EOs contain compounds such as terpenes and phenols that can interact with the lipid bilayer of microbial cell membranes, causing increased permeability. This leads to the leakage of essential cellular contents, ultimately resulting in cell death\n* Interference with Enzymatic Activity: Certain EO components can inhibit key enzymes involved in microbial metabolism. For instance, phenolic compounds such as EU (found in clove oil) can inhibit enzymes that are critical for cell wall synthesis or energy production, impeding the microorganism‚Äôs ability to survive\n* Oxidative Stress Induction: EOs can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) within microbial cells, leading to oxidative stress. This damages proteins, lipids, and DNA, further contributing to the antimicrobial action\n* Disruption of Quorum Sensing: EOs may also interfere with quorum sensing, a process by which bacteria communicate and coordinate their activities, including biofilm formation. By disrupting this communication, EOs can prevent the establishment and maintenance of biofilms, which are protective layers that render bacteria more resistant to antibiotics\n* These multifaceted mechanisms contribute to the broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of EOs, making them promising agents against MDR pathogens.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n* This study evaluated the in vitro and in silico antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of EOs derived from S. aromaticum L., N. sativa L., C. zeylanicum, and P. citrosum against selected human pathogens, including MDR pathogens.\n* These findings suggest that these EOs have promising antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities, with the highest activity observed for CBO, BSO, and CNBO against S. epidermidis.\n* In contrast, CNBO exhibited the highest antifungal activity against the tested fungi. Molecular docking results further validated the antimicrobial potential of these EOs, highlighting their ability to interact with the target proteins of several pathogens.\n* The translational potential of these EOs lies in their utility as alternative or complementary therapies for tackling MDR infections, particularly MDR biofilms, which are difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics. Their broad-spectrum activity underscores their applicability in healthcare, pharmaceutical, and agricultural settings.",

Then comes a more floral, sweet, and powdery center with jasmine and orris oil, before finally an undercurrent of patchouli and frankincense leave a deep and woody lasting impact. Alina was created by Lush perfumer of the same name who was inspired by the generations of women that came before her. Three distinct fragrances, each representing a different generation born in the last 100 years, are blended to create a multi-layered and timeless scent. She named the fragrance Alina‚Äîa name given to her by her grandmother. In this YouTube video, Alina herself talks us through the inspiration for her new fragrance that shares her name.\n\nMade in England.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Pink pepper oil brings a spicy aroma\n\n- Patchouli oil is grounding and earthy\n\n- Vanilla absolute is sweet and comforting‚Äù",

Matcha/green tea is super trendy right now but it‚Äôs always been one of the more attractive notes/themes to me and I had a feeling this would be a really solid rendition. And it was! But let me tell you, it was quickly upstaged‚Äîwhich was no easy feat.\n\nThis brand new fragrance of theirs called ‚ÄúStamen Blues‚Äù is a haymaker and it surprised me with an elusive scent that I had been searching for since I started pondering about fragrances and funky nostalgic note possibilities. It‚Äôs this weird, plasticy smell that I used to get from the really detailed and clunky action figures I used to play with as a kid‚Äîblissful. It‚Äôs soft and subtle but still very present in this concoction of theirs. Both this one and Matcha Rush are very dressed-up, mixy scents, which is what I meant by ‚Äúindulgent‚Äù earlier; the matcha is paired with orange peel, rhubarb, mint, and hazelnut (which are only the ones that I can easily make out with my nose as I read the list of notes).\n\nAs for the Stamen Blues, I can‚Äôt make out much from the notes for lack of experiencing many of them in any distinct way, maybe with exception to the ginger, all the base notes that all blend together quite seamlessly, and the ‚Äúhoneyed syrup accord‚Äù which is very prominently carrying the sweetness of the scent‚ÄîI love it.\n\nI highly suggest trying this one out (the brand in general as well, especially if you care to stick with clean and/or vegan ingredients) and if anyone can make out what might be reminding me of that plastic toy smell from the list of notes, PLEASE let me know. \n\nThanks for reading if ya did!

    "body": "Hello r/curlyhair, this is my first post here.\n\nLately I‚Äôve been trying to make my routine more environment-friendly (and hair- friendly!) by switching to solid shampoo. So I‚Äôve purchased the first one that was available to me locally, which was Balade en Provence brand. On paper it seemed great - 100% vegan, ethically made in France, no harsh ingredients (list included below) and all that jazz.\n\nBut after few tries the effects are... underwhelming to say the least. Granted, I‚Äôm aware that after years of using regular shampoos, it takes some getting used to for the hair and scalp to work with milder cleaning agents and that I shouldn‚Äôt give up just yet, but I‚Äôd really love an opinion from curlies who have more experience with shampoo bars than I do. Is it my technique that‚Äôs wrong or is this shampoo just not suited for my hair?\n\nMy complaints/questions are as follows:\n\n- I can‚Äôt get the bar to lather well. I‚Äôve tried both rubbing it against my hair and lathering it in my hands first and then putting it in my hair but in either case the foam disappears very quickly and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve actually washed my hair clean\n\n- I‚Äôm rinsing A LOT, way more than with regular shampoo, but this one seems to make a gummy layer in my hair that doesn‚Äôt wash out with water. When it‚Äôs soaked, my hair feels nice and soft, but once it dries even a little bit, the gummy feeling returns\n\n- My hair takes much longer to air dry, but once it finally does, the length and ends are nice enough, with good definition but my roots still feel a little gummy and look stringy and flat. Not a great look, overall. I can tell that the shampoo is still there, because I can smell it when I run my hands through my hair. How the hell do I get it to rinse?\n\n- Can I still put oil in my hair before washing it with a shampoo bar? I feel like it makes all of the above effects worse.\n\n- Should I cut down on styling products? So far I can‚Äôt imagine a shampoo bar could deal with product buildup well.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!\n\nFor reference, I have long, fine (but lots of it) 2c/3a type, medium porosity hair and the products I normally use are:\n\n- Garnier Fructis Hair Food Aloe Multi-Purpose Mask\n\n- Boots Essentials Curl Creme\n\n- Umberto Giannini scrunching jelly\n\n- Umberto Giannini Weather Proof Curls finishing cream\n\n- Organix Coconut Water, Hydration Oil for the ends\n\n- walnut oil before washing\n\nAnd the shampoo bar ingredient list:\nCocos nucifera oil, Vitis vinifera seed oil, Aqua, Sodium hydroxyde, Butyrospermum parkii butter, Brassica campestris seed oil, Limonene, Citrus nobilis peel oil, Citrus paradisi peel oil, Citrus sinensis peel oil expressed, Illite, Eugenia caryophyllus bud oil, Pinus sylvestris oil, Eugenol.",

The shampoo bar you are using is basically a soap (contains sodium hydroxide) so the pH is likely way too high for your hair. I have also had this issue with Chagrin Valley shampoo bars. I would recommend trying a shampoo bar that does not have sodium hydroxide in its ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have similar hair to yours and I get good results just cowashing and using a curl cream or mousse.

        "body": "The things about the article:\n\n- This study is in the lab, not in living, breathing humans. Conditions in the lab are nothing compared to infected humans. The bacteria causing Lyme disease were incubated *in the lab*, and then treated with several kinds of essential oils. One petri dish full of bacteria is not the same as a human body with bacteria in several nooks and crannies that can't be reached by application or  breathing in of essential oils.\n- The only bacterial cultures that were affected by the oils were in the stationary phase (inactive, not actively dividing) and in biofilm form (a very thin film of bacteria, possibly not actively dividing either). The oils were not having an effect on actively dividing Lyme bacteria. This would mean that the oils would have no effect on an active infection of Lyme bacteria. It is useless to treat yourself with essential oils if you're having a flareup.\n\nTo effectively treat Lyme disease, you need systemic treatment (antibiotics that can reach every single part of your body through the blood) as soon as the first symptoms show up. If you were too late, symptoms can be devastating and can last for longer than 6 months after the first signs of infection. \n\nOnce the initial infection is over, it is possible that some dormant Lyme bacteria stay behind. Antibiotics are not very effective against these bugs. This causes the flareups later on. Every time you have a flareup, you need antibiotics as soon as possible to prevent as much damage as you can. Not essential oils.\n\nThere is no harm in a bunch of essential oils, but choosing them over antibiotics when you have a flareup will be damaging to your health as they are ineffective and the bacteria can do what they do best.",

        "body": "So I was in the exact same boat as you were! From what I‚Äôve read, the issue with most shampoo bars is they‚Äôre highly alkaline due to the saponifying process for the oils, which throws off the pH of your hair and causes the weird feeling you‚Äôre experiencing. This is made even worse if the area you live in has hard water. \n\nTo combat this you can either rinse with apple cider vinegar to try and restore the pH balance of your hair, get a water softener/rinse your hair with filtered water, or you can find a pH-balanced shampoo bar. \n\nI know Ethique‚Äôs bars are pH-balanced, but I can‚Äôt attest to their quality as I‚Äôve never tried them. I‚Äôm currently using HiBAR‚Äôs moisturizing shampoo and conditioner bars and am in love with them. \n\nSource: wanted to be environmentally conscious while following the curly girl method. Hated the gross feeling shampoo bars caused, so I did a ton of research\n\nETA the ingredients for the shampoo I use:\n\nSodium Cocoyl Isethionate (Coconut Oil*), BTMS (Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol (Vegetable Based*)), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol (Coconut Oil*), Glycerin Stearate (Vegetable Based*), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearic Acid (Vegetable Based*), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (Coconut Oil*), Polyquaternium 7, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Natural Fragrance (derived from essential oils and plant extracts), Natural Pigments.

I never put anything else in the jar, it was closed, almost full, i kept it away from light and air. The other pots stored in the same conditions had nothing.

Next mix your essential oil (clove bud) )with a carrier oil (jojoba) in a bottle that has a dropper, I personally would use eucalyptus oil and jojoba oil as they both have anti-fungal properties. Most essential oils are very strong and need what is called a carrier oil to prevent the essential oil from burning your skin. I do a 2:1 mix. After a shower and when your skin/nails are fully dry, take the dropper and just let the oil drop on top of and under your nail and gently massage it in. Don't forget to massage it into your cuticles! Do it once a day, every day and in about a year, you'll see results. Just have to stay consistent. You got this! Remember, consistency is key.",

He has started to take to the bottom of the tank also.\n\nI've recently noticed deterioration of his fins from lying on the gravel, something I saw with previous bettas once they became too tired in their age.\n\nI already have some \"clove bud oil\" that I purchased today, and I've read about mixing it with water prior to cupping the betta and adding it in, but I'd like to know roughly how much and at what pace I should add the oil to make it as painless as possible.\n\nI may even consider putting him to sleep with the oil and then euthanising him using other methods, whatever is considered the \"best\".\n\nThanks so much",

It actually just started to come in like 2 years ago when I was 29.\n\nIt was a little sore when it was coming in. The discomfort was short lived and it ended up feeling normal. It never did fully come out all the way and is still partially erupted. It has still been ok. I haven't had any issues eating. I haven't had any problems... until a few days ago. I have a sore spot that developed. It is the gum around the wisdom tooth that's a bit sore. It mostly hurts when I try to eat certain things on that side and it gets poked. It doesn't look red and I don't see any pus. The pain is not horrific. It isn't like a throbbing pain that keeps me up or prevents me from eating anything. It is just a bit sore when certain stuff hits that area. If I'm not eating, it doesn't hurt at all. It also hurts a little when I brush my back teeth on that side. I still brush, but I am more gentle on that side.\n\nI've been rinsing it like twice a day with warm sea salt water to help ease discomfort as well as keep it cleaner and lower my risks of infection developing. That has been helping a lot I think. Well, upon researching, I heard that you can dab some clove bud oil on the sore tooth/gum and it will act as a natural numbing agent. So I grabbed some clove bud essential oil and tried it out tonight. Now I have few things concerning me after the fact -\n\n1. I actually read more into it and a lot of articles said you absolutely CANNOT use undiluted clove bud oil in your mouth, especially on a gum because it can lead to toxicity and stuff. It said it high doses, clove oil can be toxic to humans. What exactly defines \"high doses\" though? I only used 2 cotton swabs worth. I didn't use much. I dipped a cotton swab into the oil then dabbed it onto that sore area around my wisdom tooth. Am I at risk of getting sick? What symptoms or signs would I have to look for if it did negatively impact me? It has been over 4 hours and I'm still living and breathing. I don't notice anything different.\n\n2. Is it ok to use if I dilute it with coconut oil? I honestly don't know if I can because the taste was AWFUL. It was so bad! I had to rinse my mouth so much after. I honestly don't think I can use it again. Such a disgusting taste. I am strongly considering just returning it. I don't really have any other uses for it.\n\nThanks for any insight!",

I have a feeling now that it‚Äôs a fungal infection, and it‚Äôs since spread to another fish in the school. \n\nI did three doses of SeaChem kanaplex (both in the water and mixed with some frozen brine shrimp) that was recommended by several folks, including the helpful associate at my LFS. It initially seemed to clear up, but then it spread, and now this morning I saw the original lil guy upside down. He‚Äôs still moving, but pretty much all his fins are clamped and he‚Äôs having a hard time keeping up with everyone else. I haven‚Äôt seen him upside down since he righted himself this morning, but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs a sign that he‚Äôs ready to go. \n\nSince nothing else has worked, and he‚Äôs been sick for so long (over a month at this point), I‚Äôm wondering if it isn‚Äôt kinder to put him down.

    "body": "I have been doing IF for a little over 4 months.  I mostly do 20:4 with some 18:6.  Every once in awhile I‚Äôll have a more relaxed day and do 16:8.  I don‚Äôt do any diets (researched a ton about diets and the statistics around their success). I eat intuitively during my window and don‚Äôt deny myself things I enjoy.  I love the quality/taste of good food!!  But I do not over eat.\n\nHere‚Äôs my question:  I have been losing REALLY slowly and am wondering if two habits are kicking me out of a fasted state.  The reason I fast is for the benefits of autophagy but now I‚Äôm nervous I may not be getting those benefits.  I take an allergy pill (Allegra D) every morning and I drink two different teas mixed together.  Ingredients are below.  Are my allergy pill and tea kicking me out of fasting?  I am I doing 20:4 for no other reason than calorie restriction?  Any suggestions on what I should other than the teas below?  Hot water with lemon?  Can‚Äôt do green tea...it makes me crazy nauseous. \n\nTea 1:  Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, vanilla extract, sarsaparilla, orange oil, natural cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil, cardamom oil\n\nTea 2:  Blended black teas, cinnamon, ginger root, clove bud oil, cinnamon flavor, allspice, nutmeg, cardamom oil\n\nThank you!!!",

And only the one green tea? Or even white tea - the super young leaf of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) type not the black tea with milk/cream type. I think that plant (along with black coffee) helps promote autophagy\n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit: just saw your green tea comment. Have you tried making green tea lighter? Ie, not leave the leaves in for long & using slightly cooled boiled water? I found if I made my green tea & left the leaves steep for too long, I‚Äôm a little queasy after drinking it.",

    "body": " \n\nKerassentials is a remedy that helps consumers to heal from foot fungus with natural ingredients. The formula is easy to use, offering up to six bottles of the serum in one purchase.\n\n## What is Kerassentials?\n\nOne of the most embarrassing issues that consumers can face is toenail fungus. Some people prefer to air out their feet, while others hide away the infection in full-coverage shoes. The only way to get rid of this embarrassing problem is to treat it, but some medications can be painful and damaging to the surrounding skin. The use of a formula called Kerassentials can completely change this healing.\n\n[Kerassentials provides a topical way of healing the skin safely](https://kerassentialsoil.shop), thanks to the work of Dr. Kimberly Langdon. Dr. Langdon explains that she‚Äôs the leading fungal expert, and she‚Äôs responsible for creating several devices that help users to improve their nail health. Her formula is meant to use natural plants to promote better health generally, but they have a profound effect on foot and toenail fungus.\n\n## How Does Kerassentials Work?\n\nIn total, there are over a dozen ingredients in this remedy to improve how quickly it promotes healing. Some of the highlighted ingredients on the website include:\n\n* Clove bud oil\n* Lavender oil\n* Organic flaxseed\n* Manuka oil\n* Undecylenic acid\n* Isopropyl palmitate\n* Almond oil\n* Tea tree essential oil\n* Aloe vera leaf\n* DL-Alpha tocopherol acetate oil\n* Lemongrass oil\n\nRead on below to learn a little more information about this remedy.\n\n### Clove Bud Oil\n\nClove bud oil reduces the risk of fungus multiplying, which means that the infection stops spreading. It also kills off the fungal spores, and it protects the user from developing a fungal infection somewhere else on the body.\n\n### Lavender Oil\n\nLavender oil stops the fungus from feeding on keratin, which is found in the nails. [It prevents the fungus from eating anything else, which means that it will starve without spreading](https://kerassentialsoil.shop).\n\n### Organic Flaxseed\n\nOrganic flaxseed helps the user to grow back their healthy nails after they‚Äôve previously been destroyed by the fungal infection. It promotes immunity and inhibits the growth of fungus.\n\n### Manuka Oil\n\nManuka oil surpasses how effective tea tree oil can be. It even deals with the worst of fungal infections, attacking it.\n\n### Undecylenic Acid\n\nThe undecylenic acid is used to help the fungus destroy itself from within. It attacks the membranes, disrupting the natural structure of the fungus.\n\n### Isopropyl palmitate\n\nIsopropyl palmitate improves the moisture in the skin. It provides support as an emollient and makes the remedy easier to spread.\n\n### Almond oil\n\nAlmond oil improves heart health when ingested. However, it can be used as a moisturizing ingredient in this formula, protecting from sun damage.\n\n### Tea tree essential oil\n\nTea tree essential oil may not be as powerful as manuka oil, but it can help with inflammation and trigger healing activity as needed.\n\n### Aloe vera leaf\n\nAloe vera leaf can be used to heal skin issues like burns and dryness. It reduces blemishes, and it can be used to support skin structure.\n\n### DL-Alpha tocopherol acetate oil\n\nDL-Alpha tocopherol acetate oil can help with wound healing. It also reduces inflammation.\n\n### Lemongrass oil\n\nLemongrass oil fights bacterial infection.

I looked like a zombie with my ragged nails. ProNail Complex impressed me with its promise to fix my troublesome and weird-looking toenails.  \n  \nThis product promised to strengthen and revitalize nails with vitamins, minerals, and botanical extracts. I was apprehensive but curious enough to try. ProNail Complex also claimed no toxins. It follows Good Manufacturing Practice and employs safe ingredients.  \n  \nThis blend of tea tree oil, vitamin E, sweet almond oil, and others seemed like a panacea for fungal infections and inflamed nail beds without synthetic additives or questionable manufacturing.\n\n  \n*What drew me to this toenail health product?*\n\n  \nI was intrigued with ProNail Complex at first. The blend of Tea Tree, Walnut Oil, and antifungal substances caught my eye. Years of fighting persistent toenail fungus left me searching for a solution. This product's promise to battle fungus and increase nail health was too tempting to pass up. This bottle's natural solutions captivated me. Reading about its Canola Oil and Aloe Vera ingredients made me assume it could treat my nail-irritated skin.  \n  \nAs a hopeful but wary foot fungus fighter, I decided to test this mist spray's big claims.\n\n>  \n[**>> The Pronail Complex Official Website Has An Ongoing Discount. Click Here To Order While It Lasts!**](https://mweblinx.com/8920/911/7/)\n\n# Pronail Complex Reviews Consumer Reports\n\n  \nLet me tell you how ProNail Complex changed my toenails. Due to swimming in moist environments, my nails were weak and ugly before using this oil.  \n  \nProNail Complex contains antifungal undecylenic acid and natural oils including jojoba, lemongrass, and lavender. These substances create a fungi-free environment to strengthen nails.  \n  \nChanges appeared when I used the spray everyday, following its simple application instructions. My toenails looked better and felt harder and more resistant to fracture, proving that internal care is equally as important as outward care.  \n  \nIt was impressive to watch soothing elements address inflammation head-on and create healthier-looking toenails without harsh chemicals or intrusive treatments.  \n  \n**Fungal infection symptoms gone**: ProNail Complex gave me a real edge against toenail fungus. The cream immediately attacked the troublesome skin invaders. My nails became less itchy and discolored. It felt like my toe-damaging microorganisms were finally defeated.  \n  \nAfter many weeks using ProNail Complex, my nails looked and felt stronger. Walking and wearing shoes were no longer painful. There was comfort in every step, not simply vanity. This product also improved my toenails' appearance.  \n  \n**Improved toenail look**: My toenails improved after weeks of ProNail Complex. They grew stronger and shiny. The product's Tea Tree, Walnut, and Canola oils helped change it. My nails are no longer brittle and drab.\n\n# Personal Experience: 3 Months with ProNail Complex\n\nI literally dove into the ProNail Complex. I experimented with oils and extracts on my toenails for 90 days.  \n  \n**First impressions**  \nI was skeptical before trying ProNails Complex. Healthy toenails and a fight against tenacious fungal infections looked too good to be true. After reading about others' successes, curiosity took over.  \n  \nI laughed as I sprayed this magic-as-claimed mist on my toes on day one. Could it truly work?  \n  \nPleasant tea tree and lavender oil perfume surprised me with its spa-like aroma. It felt like self-care each time I applied it. This became a tiny wellness routine for my often-neglected feet, making me look forward to applying it twice a day.  \n  \n**Check out what happened midway through!**  \nChanges occurred halfway through my ProNail Complex test. My nails strengthened and looked better. This product worked wonderfully by fading fungal white patches. Seeing progress without adverse effects was inspiring.  \n  \nSpraying became a daily habit. Due of their attractive smells, jojoba and lemongrass oils made application helpful and delightful. My toenails improved daily as the inflamed skin around them calmed.  \n  \n**Final Results and Thoughts**  \nI saw tremendous results after 90 days of following Pro Nails Complex's recommended practice. Never have my toenails looked better. Their strength and appearance have improved. I was first skeptical of products that claimed to treat onychomycosis or athlete's foot without a prescription. I stand corrected. The combination of jojoba, lemongrass, and chia oil works wonders.  \n  \nPatience is crucial; effects took months to appear. Implementing healthy foot practices went beyond applying the mist spray. This adventure taught me to give natural ingredients time to work‚Äîantifungal capabilities aren't instantaneous miracles but require constant use.  \n  \nNext, we'll examine ProNail Complex's constituents.\n\n[**>> The Pronail Complex Official Website Has An Ongoing Discount.

Vitamin E protects nail beds from oxidative stress, preventing cell death.\n* Walnut Oil moisturises even the roughest nails, not simply for cooking. Camphor Oil soothes toe inflammation, while Clove Bud Oil fights bacteria.\n* Jojoba Oil, which closely resembles human sebum, balances nail oil production without greasiness, while Chia Seed Oil offers antioxidants to protect against daily exposures like UV rays and harsh chemicals found at home or work, where you're likely most exposed during daily activities indoors/outdoors.\n* Lemongrass Oil adds scent and antifungal effects to this powerful formula that keeps fungal invaders at bay and promotes foot health! Lavender's calming aroma and Menthol's cooling sensations when applied topically provide immediate comfort moments after application, enhancing user experience greatly over time through repeated applications as needed!\n* Undecylenic Acid is a powerhouse fighter in the mix that can effectively combat various forms of fungi responsible for most issues relating to unhealthy looking/feeling toes, completing the lineup with ingredients chosen to address a wide range of issues related to maintaining optimal appearance and condition.\n\n# How ProNail Complex helps toenails\n\n  \nDripping ProNail Complex onto my toes starts the magic. This medication fights harmful bacteria and fungus that damage toenails.  \n  \nHealthy nails, both on the surface and deep down where the battle is.

Double-check. It's amazing how these components work together to defend my nails from moisture and problems.  \n  \nIn this regular routine, I saw small alterations that became obvious. ProNail Complex made my nails healthier, stronger, and shine like \"I'm well-cared-for.\" My feet won an unexpected journey.  \n  \n**Tips for Use**\n\n* Regularly apply ProNail Complex after showering.

A brief sprinkle on feet and toenails works. Let it soak before putting on socks or shoes.\n* Also keep a bottle by bed.
