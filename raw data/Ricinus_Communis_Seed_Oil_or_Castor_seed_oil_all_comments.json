    "body": "#Rant#\n\nUntil recently, i only used sulphate free shampoos thinking it would be much better for my wavy/curly hair but i always used so much of product (even after dissolving it in water and emulsifying in my hands), they never removed the oil one go either leading me to go for a second rinse which inturn wastes water and it took me so much of time to just shampoo my hair. \n\nI was fear-mongered HARD. I have tried so many sulphate free shampoos and never stuck to one, i was never impressed with any. So many of them i just ended up using on my body because i got bored of them and didn't like them. At first, i believed the \"sUlpHatEs aRe bAd fOR YoU' movie trop and then, when i got to know about the CGM, i got even more afraid of them (double homicide, if i may). But over the past year ive tried some shampoos with sls in them and i always noticed less hairfall.\n\nI have been concerned about my hairfall for years, ive lost the volume i used to have back in school and mom's comments on my hair is just the cherry on cake i need. I am trying my best to feel confident in the hair I have and not letting insecurities affect me yet trying to take care of them and reduce as much of hairfall as possible. \n\nI am, i think, loosing the normal amount of hair its just my brain telling me that I need to immediately rush to the doctor. Lowkey a triggering topic, tbvh. \n\nI am just thankful i started using sulphates again and i dont have any plans to stop. Plus sulphates are better for my oily scalp.\n\n#Review#\n\nPrice- Rs. 149 for 192.5 ml.\n\nINGREDIENTS: WATER SUM LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, DIMETHICONE, FRAGRANCE, C177891/TITANIUM DIOXIDE, GUAR HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CASTOR SEED OIL, MICA, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUMBENZOATE, SODIUMHYDROXIDE, HYDROXYCITRONELLAL, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, HYDROXYPROPYLTRIMONIUM HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARETH-6, ACETIC ACID, PEG-100 STEARATE, TRIDECETH-10, TRIDECETH-S SALICYLICACID, LIMONENE, FUMARICACIO PANTHENOL BENZYL SALICYLATE, LINALOOL BENZYLALCOHOL, PENTYLENE GLYCOL AMODIMETHICONE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL JONONE, CARSONER, GERANIOL, CITRIC ACID CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL HEXYL CINNAMAL, GLYCERIN, GLYCOL DISTEARATE (FLL CE552/).\n\nHairtype- wavy/curly, oily scalp, dry ends.\n\nHair care Products- khadi protein mask (once a week), aloe gel (whenever i feel like), livon (trying to finish it up).\nI have stopped oiling completely\n\nI recently shifted L'oreal Dream Lengths Shampoo (because of the rave reviews here) and i think I have finally found the shampoo for me (don't want to jinx). I get less hairfall, it emulsifies easily, i dont need to spend a ton of time rubbing it in to remove any sort of build up and I haven't noticed any dryness of my hair as such. I haven't seen any difference in curls either (NOTE: I dont follow CGM rigorously, i have just picked up a couple of steps that suit me).\n\nI shampoo twice a week, once a week i either do aloeing or apply the khadi mask (an HG btw). Then i wrap my hair in a t-shirt and also wear a satin hair bonnet while sleeping. I have almost stopped using hair ties and only stick to those huge-ass clutchers (clips). I dont use any products after shampooing because i hate the feeling. I'll just sometimes use livon to finish that up but i don't think I'll be able to before it expires.\n\nMy shampoo method- I take a little bit of a shampoo in a mug, add water onto it and pour it on my scalp ONLY. I dont wash my ends everytime i shampoo, like once a week is enough. \n\nStatus- WRP",

I have now just decided to ignore this noise. \n\nIncidentally, I also learned that sodium lauryl sulphate is the harsh sulphate, which is not commonly used anymore.

Mukti gold herbal hairwash - this shampoo is used by my whole family and my dad especially have seen a drastic change in his hairfall  and we used to have tresseme shampoo before this, bcuz of which we switched onto this herbal hairwash shampoo\n2. A homemade serum after wash (aloevera gel, rose essential oil, glycerine, rose water), this makes my hair smell heavenly nice. Only I use it \n3. Cold pressed coconut oil before hair wash - for 1-2 hr , only me and my mom do the oiling part.\n4. Washing my hair more often - 3 times a week\n\nNow I would like the share the mistakes I used to make which when corrected helped me in hairfall.\n\n+ oiling for long hours -  I used to oil my hair a night before hairwash day. But one of my friend told me that oiling for long hours is one of the major reason of hairfall. So now I make sure that I don't keep oil in my hair for more than 2 hrs.\n\n+ Oiling with the right oil - I used to oil my hair with dabur amla hair oil  after which I switched to pure coconut oil.\n\n+ Diet - I eat 2 soaked walnuts, 10 soaked almonds, 2 soaked anjeer, 2 cashews. I drink anjeer water with anjeer. I have been following this religiously for a very long time. And I believe this has helped immensely in improving my hair texture. \n\n+ Washing my hair after every 2nd day - I have noticed that after every 2nd my hair gets oily and itchy and if I don't wash it the same day. My hair starts to fall out. I sort of wash my hair at every alternate day.\n\nLet me know if you guys have any questions related to this. \n\nHAPPY TO HELP üòä",

I am using the L'Or√©al Total Repair 5 and I have no complaints. \n\nThe most important thing in my opinion is the conditioner. Even then it's more about letting the conditioner sit and work for a few minutes that makes a lot of difference. I have tried Pantene, Sunsilk, TRESemm√© and Garnier Ultra Blends conditioners and the Pantene works really well for my fine hair.

Tried all of them out there, from cheapest to most expensive, but none worked for my hair. Cut to Biotique, and my hair got so smooth and shiny. Hairfall reduced tremendously. Hair growth got better, less split ends. Then I recently switched to other sulphate free shampoos, and no matter how less or more I apply, my hair looks so dead and dull. So, I don't care if Biotique is sulphate or sulphate free. I just know its gentle, and even if I use more, it never harms me. It always repairs my hair beyond my expectation (I suffer from depression so I can go for long periods without taking care of my hair) and makes them silky smooth and in no need of any extra treatment.

It's impossible to last without sulphates. Most CG shampoos also have milder sulphates because they're cleansing agents. Shampoos also tend to have polyquaternium which is a conditioning agent that builds up (certain kinds of Polyquaternium build up more than others). Without sulphates you won't get rid of the buildup and it will lead to poor scalp health. \n\nI use Pantene Lively Clean every once in a while (maybe once a month, twice in the humid summers). It's got \"harsh\" sulphates which strip my hair and scalp clean of all buildup. Unfortunately with really short hair you can't avoid getting shampoo all up in your hair. \n\nAs to whether sulphates cause less hairfall, I won't comment because everyone shair and scalp are different. I found a method that works for me and In glad you could introduce it to your routine too without much issue :) \n\nSulphates and silicones aren't necessarily bad. It's also important to remember that you lose more hair during high humidity conditions. That's normal.",

Also, there is the fact that toothbrush heads produce mechanical wear of the bristles through contact with our teeth, which would necessarily produce a significant amount of microplastics that both we can accidentally ingest (especially if you do not rinse your mouth after brushing like your'e supposed to do in order to let fluoride in the toothpaste do its thing), and which would enter water streams/sources around us from our sink water.\n\nAny other solutions? I know that the sustainable tomorrow produces bamboo electric brushes with castor seed oil bristles. That in theory would get rid of problem of constantly shedding microplastics into our bodies and the water around us from brushing (ideally) twice a day. \n\nAre there any fully legit non plastic toothbrush heads and brushes that are electric that you know of? anything else as a solution?",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "**EDIT: I am quite angry. I feel like all of my concerns have been ignored. I woke up today to find that the KK Store owner is actively promoting the glitters on her facebook and giving them away for free. She has obviously chosen to ignore legitimate concerns and carry on regardless. I do not find the neons in the store inventory but she is still promoting unsafe and dangerous products. I have reported the store to the Store Envy team and will be making a complaint to the FDA and I ask that you all do the same.**\n\n**EDIT EDIT: I just received a message from her, she said that she was not the one controlling the facebook page so she didn't see that it was still being promoted. She has also now removed all glitters from sale and will be reformulating them. She asked if I would be interested in doing a follow up review once she has fixed everything and I told her that i would. i think that is only fair :)**\n\n\nEarlier today I made a post asking for advice regarding a brand I had gotten involved with. [The post is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/31akqi/help_needed_re_possibly_unsafe_cosmetics_and_fda/). My reasons for with holding the brand name were innocent and simple. It was not done maliciously or to cause drama. I had been invited by a friend (who I had \"worked\" with on Rockeresque's promo team) to join up with the Korpse Kosmetics Promo team. As it was a friend who was also part of the group, I happily joined them, expecting the same kind of fun we had in Rockeresque, I stupidly did not research the brand first as I trusted my friend. I am not from the USA and needed some help determining if the products reached FDA guidelines as they are different to my own countries and I didn't want to share the name immediately as I felt that I should inform the owner that :\n\n* 1. I was not happy with the products\n* 2. I felt the products were not to FDA guidelines\n* 3. I would not be promoting them\n\nbefore I went ahead and made a bad review. I have had a few PM's from people who guessed the brand, had similar experiences and a few who were annoyed I didn't straight up out the company. If you feel it was unfair of me to check facts and show a little courtesy to the owner I am sorry that you feel that way.\n\nAnyway, aside from being very irritated with myself for not fact checking and blindly trusting a friend, here is the whole saga.\n\n\n[Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ)\n\n\nI agreed to join the Korpse Kosmetics (KK) Promo team in January based on my friends recommendation. The owner was pleased to have me on board and welcomed me to the group She is incredibly friendly and helpful and I hope that she doesn't hate me for an honest review. I placed a large-ish order of 6 lip paints and 4 eyeliners, and I was incredibly excited to get them. A few days after the order was placed I was invited to show my work at a convention. I messaged the owner and asked if it was possible to purchase some sample bags or something to give away to customers. She was very helpful and actually offered to send them with my order for free. So far everything was going to plan.\n\nThe convention was in the first week of March and 5 days before I received a message from Store Envy that my order had been shipped. I knew that it would not arrive in time and asked if the owner would like the sample returning. This question was never answered and it did not matter as by mid March the package was still MIA. I contacted the owner a few times, keeping her updated and she did appear to make efforts to track the package. In the end she re-sent the order with \"a few bonus goodies for the trouble\". Again I was very happy with the communication and service I was receiving and believed the international postage was to blame.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, the package arrived as as most of you will probably understand this feeling, I was excited for products! The light was bad so I decided to wait until this morning to open the package and test, photograph and enjoy the products. As a bonus for the wait I received 4 neon glitters which are promoted as cosmetic grade. All the products came in 5gram clear jars with black lids and home made product stickers (which are pretty cute) So far everything seems on a par with other Indie Brands I have tested.\n\nThen I turned the jars over and instead of finding a little label with ingredients and the shade name, I found a small sticker with a handwritten shade name. Now this seemed a little odd and unprofessional but as someone in the other thread pointed out, they might've chosen to save a few bucks on official stickers. \n\nOn the website I did find an ingredient listing but it was a generic, \"our products contain these\" not specific listings for each shade and product. I also noted that there was not weight or product size information for each product.\n\nNow the glitters have a few problems. First off the sparkle is almost non existent. They are plastic like and are very large sand like chunks. Even my husband thought that I had purchased craft sand and was concerned that I would use it on my face, and he knows NOTHING of cosmetics. They are also a little static, so the particles stick together and it is hard to get a smooth layer don't worry I did not put these on my face!) When compared to one of the LIT Cosmetic glitters it was even more painful to see the low quality.\n\nNext the lipsticks or Lip Paints as they are named. They smelled terrible but I am fully aware that scent is a preference. They are semi solid, quite greasy and some of them were not mixed properly with lumps of unblended (is that the right word?) pigment in the mixture. It is also obvious by the vast amount of air pockets in the jars that the mixture is not made liquid and then decanted into the jars. Instead it seems to be smushed in and does not fill the whole space of the jar. The jars were also in my opinion, carelessly filled. Some were over flowing with product in the threads of the jar, some filled the lid and others appeared to contain less product than others.\n\nWhen I opened the eyeliners I was confronted with the same situation and smell. I also noted immediately that one of the eyeliners appeared to be IDENTICAL to one of the lip paints. Which really annoyed me as I don't want or need two pots of the same product. If the lipstick is eye safe or eyeliner lip safe then I am happy. I also failed to find this information on the website. I swatched the two apparently identical products side by side and I really feel that they are the same. Maybe the eyeliner is *slightly* thicker consistency, but it is not enough for it to be a liner in my opinion. The eyeliners also had the same greasy, vaseline like texture as the lip paints. \n\nI also discovered a fingerprint in the lid of one of the lipsticks.\n\nAt this point I can to r/indiemakeupandmore for some advice regarding cosmetic grade glitter, ingredient listings and the sale of products which are apparently identical but labeled differently.\n\nThrough the post I came into contact with a number of people who had had equally dodgy dealings with the brand but  will leave it up to them to tell their stories.\n\nAn hour after swatching the colours on my arm I developed a red blotchy and itchy rash but now 5 hours later it has subsided and all seems well.\n\nAlso contacted the owner with all of my above concerns. She got back to me and addressed each point:\n(I am going to copy paste her answers)\n\n* Handwritten labels: \"yes I usually write the names on the bottom with the stickers. Since I print all the labels myself it saves a lot of ink\"\n\n* The smell: \"really? they didn't have a smell to me,  In the lip paints I used some essential oils to make it have more of a lipstick smell.\" \n\n* The similarities between lip paint and eyeliner: \"The liners and lip paints are really different tho I do understand how they do look a lot alike and have been trying to change that\"\n\n* Ingredients listings: \"Well I have it on my website. But I can change to printing the bottom labels with the ingredients\" (She also provided me with the ingredients listings but again just generic ingredients, not specific to each shade)\n\n\nEyeshadows: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, TITANIUM Dioxide, Iron Oxide & May Contain Some Glitters\n\n\nBlushes: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nSirens Glow: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nMINERAL Veils: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nLip Paints:Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide, Castor Seed Oil, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Olive Fruit Oil, HYDROGENATED Castor Oil, Glycine Soybean Lipds, Lauryl Laurate, Carnauba Wax, Candillia Wax.\n\n\n* Fingerprint: \"Well I make sure I sanatize my hands before working on each inditvidual shadow or liner or whatever but I shall get some gloves asap\"\n\n* Glitter:  The glitters are cosmetic grade. I purchased them from a well known site. (she provided me with links to the products she purchased and was under the impression she had purchased [Ben Nye Glitters](http://www.starcostumes.com/Sparklers-Glitter-5-oz-p/abld.htm?1=1&CartID=0), this is the link for the [Neons](http://www.dhgate.com/product/1kg-0-3mm-neon-glitter-dust-body-glitter/181828155.html?utm_source=pla&utm_medium=GMC&utm_campaign=della520&utm_term=181828155&f=bm%7c181828155%7c018009-NailArtSalon%7cGMC%7cAdwords%7cpla%7cdella520%7cUS%7c018009006-NailArt%7cc%7c%7c0LRF%7c&gclid=CjwKEAjw9PioBRDdpqy0-ofG3DgSJAACe5NEqioYBdo-w_TTTg8vhRNOKSl2Zqbfa8_wqrZf1KiwbBoC1ALw_wcB)  I also spoke to my lovely friend who works for a cosmetics company and from the pictures it was said that these glitters are not cosmetic grade. \n\n* When I told her that the glitters were most likely NOT cosmetic grade: \"Are you serious?WTF.....I'm going to have to contact them right now and leave them a nasty message, okay now im really upset. Thank you for letting me know. I really do appreciate it and so so sorry.\nI feel terrible\"\n\n\nNow it is up to you, I feel as though although her answers were a bit vague and sketchy, she seemed genuinely upset about the glitters. Personally I don't know how she thought she was getting Ben Nye for that price, or that she couldn't see that the glitter was not of good quality but I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. She has promised to make changes and I hope that she does. She was upset but happy that I was honest and the conversation was amicable. She also understood why I would not be joining the promo team and asked if it was ok to get advice if needed. \n\nThe album of the cosmetics is here [Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ), linked at the top too, with lots of captions. Sorry for the monster wall of text, I hope everyone is satisfied with this review. I wanted the whole story before making a bad review. I love Indie Brands and this has not put me off. I will continue on my indie quest. In 3 years this is the first bad experience I have had and hopefully it will be my last. To all the awesome Indie Brands out there, I love you!\n",

This saponifies the oil and converts it to soap, which will then dissolve in water and flush away.  (If you use hot water alone, you may melt it at the site of the clog, allowing it to flow away, but it will just flow downstream and then form a new clog as it cools.)\n\nFor treating (2):  Firstly, this is only likely if your water is hard.  Some regions use well water and that can sometimes have high level of calcium and magnesium carbonate and/or other salts.  These will react with soap (but not detergent) to form \"soap scum,\" or the calcium salts of the saponified fats.  There are numerous web sites that recommend baking soda plus vinegar for removal of soap scum accumulations.

The making process between hard bar soap and liquid soap is similar, but differs primarily in the saponification process (saponification = combining fats, water, and lye under specific conditions). Bar soap uses sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and liquid soaps uses potassium hydroxide (KOH). Soap batter with NaOH in a mold will harder. Soap batter with KOH turns into a sticky paste that must be diluted with water after the saponification process is complete.   \n\n\nIf they are following labeling best practices, coconut oil would be the highest quantity of oils. And a soap recipe will be about 65% oils, all said and done (counting the water, additives like kaolin clay and scents, the like). That would potentially be a LOT of coconut oil in their recipe, which is not a choice I would make.   \n\n\nI would recommend using a different soap. \n\nTo clear out my drains when things are running slow, I periodically run some Thrift and hot water down the drain. Thrift is sodium hydroxide as well (science is fun!) and if you've never handled it before, be sure to read up on safety instructions. Thrift (NaOH) is caustic and when combined with water, it creates a good amount of toxic vapor and undergoes an exothermic reaction (gets really hot!).",

Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ‚Çπ40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ‚Çπ130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ‚Çπ250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ‚Çπ1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering.

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It‚Äôs also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don‚Äôt want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it‚Äôs not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it‚Äôs not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser‚Äôs so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it‚Äôs not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they‚Äôre both kind of the point (it‚Äôs sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don‚Äôt want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging‚Äôs nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I‚Äôm trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP ¬£5, currently ¬£3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‚Äòthis product is unavailable‚Äô but it‚Äôs definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I‚Äôm getting near the bottom of the jar and it‚Äôs on offer again. I think it‚Äôs just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It‚Äôs thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it‚Äôs the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It‚Äôs not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There‚Äôs a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I‚Äôm not sure, as I haven‚Äôt noticed one, but my underlying skin colour‚Äôs quite pale and so it‚Äôs not always visible on me. On days when I especially don‚Äôt care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it‚Äôs deepest winter and I‚Äôm barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it‚Äôs great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I‚Äôm probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

They make all kinds of cosmetic goods from bar soap to beard oil to shaving soap. Thanks to u/sapat1, this week I was able to try out their newest line of shaving products called ‚ÄúMe≈°tar‚Äù, which fittingly translates to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù.\n\n**Me≈°tar shaving soap** features a natural, vegetal base including nice ingredients like aloe, kokum and cacao butter, castor seed oil and peppermint oil. The peppermint oil is added for some sort of cosmetic benefit, but it also adds to the very minty smell of the soap. There are also a couple of other essential oils like patchouli added for scent, but I really only can smell the mint. It‚Äôs a fresh mint smell, and seems to fit perfectly for people using this soap in a coastal city like Split, Croatia. This scent reminds me of a shaving soap I first tried in South Africa last year made by River Valley Trading, which is a nice, straightforward mint scent with no fragrance oils added, much like Me≈°tar.\n\nIn terms of performance, the soap is very easy to load into a brush and lather up. I used both a badger and synthetic brush this week, and I had no issues starting with dry or wet brushes with either. In terms of its performance during the shave, I find Me≈°tar to be an above average vegetal soap. The post-shave feeling is much better than the commercial European options that are out there, and feels slicker and even more protective than those, too. This soap should have no issue competing with those commercial offerings in Europe, especially at its current price of around $12 USD per tub. If Spartium wanted to sell Me≈°tar soap here in the United States, I think they would have to offer the soap in a variety of scents to compete with the other artisan European soapmakers we often see here stateside like Abbate y La Mantia, Eufros, Nuavia, etc.\n\nI very much enjoyed using the **Me≈°tar aftershave lotion** this week. As the name suggests, the aftershave lotion does have a slightly different feel to it compared to a balm. It feels slightly tackier and doesn‚Äôt absorb as quickly as the balms that I normally use, but it doesn‚Äôt manage to leave your skin feeling greasy either. A little goes a long way when using the Me≈°tar aftershave, and it has done a good job of comforting and protecting my skin all week. Regarding the scent, I absolutely love the smell of this balm! It‚Äôs an aquatic with a touch of vetiver, and I think it complements the soap scent quite well. I know it is not always possible for artisans to do this, but I would love for brands to release more complementary rather than matching sets in the future, particularly ones with simpler soap scents and more complex aftershave scents. The aftershave retails for around $9 a bottle, which I think is an absolute steal.\n\n**Next week** I‚Äôm going to review a modern razor that is graciously on loan, as well as some sort of current, American soap to take a break from the international soap series ‚ò∫ Thank you all for reading this review and watching my video ‚Äì until next time!",

I call bullshit‚Ä¶\") and promptly forgot about it. I did not remember until I opened the package, and then I immediately wondered why I had wasted my money. The package is very cheaply done, with the plastic bubble crudely stapled to the cardboard back. The back of the package includes assembly instructions, because this razor uses *two DE blades*.\n\nThe razor itself has a metal handle, a metal top cap, and a plastic baseplate with an open comb and a solid safety bar side. The final piece is a very thin shim you place between the two blades. You snap a blade in half, and put those in the top cap, then the shim, then the full blade, and then the baseplate. Yes, before you ask, **it's crazy fiddly to get the two bottom blade halves to stay lined up**. Once everything is assembled correctly, the two blades are separated by a small gap. It looks aggressive, but the razor is in fact quite mild. The open comb side is more aggressive, with a  bit more blade feel to it (and a bit of scrape), while the solid bar side is quite mild. I did not have much trouble at all finding the angle, but the two sides do feel different to me. The handle is more comfortable than I thought it would be, and the razor overall is easy to use, other than the blade assembly.\n\nI got pretty good shaves all week, and very good shaves in spots, but I was not blown away by this razor. I did experiment with a number of different assembly options, with the single blade plus shim being the best of the bunch. This is an easy fun razor to use, and a great addition to my collection, but it is *just too fiddly to assemble*.\n\n**[Kerkini \"2019\" tallow and buffalo milk soap](https://www.etsy.com/listing/663656707/buffalo-milk-tallow-shaving-soap-kepkinh)** - I was contacted via Instagram to see if I wanted to try out this Greek soap, made with local water buffalo milk. Uh, yes please! I am a big fan of soaps with milk because of the added fats and skin conditioning they offer. This soap is a relatively hard tallow-based soap with water buffalo milk, olive oil, castor seed oil, argan oil, and avocado oil. While the soap can be a bit thirsty, I had zero issues building excellent dense creamy lathers all week. The lather is very slick and protective, with that wonderful fatty feel, and with a long-lasting density. Rinsing between passes, as some do (and others should), makes for a very slick residual layer of soap. Immediate post shave is very good. This is a full fat soap which delivered great shaves all week.\n\nThe scent, for me, comes across as a classic cologne style scent with a  warm, woody undertone to it - quite nice and pretty strong off the puck and while lathered. The scent profile is described as \"Top notes of lemon, coriander and black pepper with some hints of patchouli and amber into a base of oud, vetiver and sandalwood\". Very pleasant!\n\n**Epsilon \"Blue Mediterranean\" Aftershave** - Let's say that this is not in fact a perfect replica of Floid Blue. It is **very close** if it is not in fact identical. Either way, it smells amazing, such a classic European barbershop aftershave scent. Light citrus, a touch of menthol, big hit of alcohol, with a blast of scent that dries down quickly but leaves behind a light lingering presence. Jesus Christ, this smells good! Better than Floid Suave? Not sure I would go that far, but it is right there. If you like the lighter Myrsol aftershaves, get on this pronto.\n\n**Carnavis & Richardson aluminum brush** - this is a great brush - easy to hold, with the knot set at the point where the knot gains a good bit of backbone. Perfect for a harder soap like the Kerkini. So glad I won this brush!\n\n**Exapunks** - this game looks like something really different for me to try. Hacking zines, and logic/programming puzzles - let's see how much fun it is!\n",

    "body": "In my attempt to refresh my love of wetshaving it seems like I'm looking to what artisan soaps are in the EU. Like many of our fellow EU wetshavers they don't get many NA brands and we don't see as many EU brands, but it's a bit easier for us due to regulations. One brand that came across my radar was E&S Rasage, a husband and wife team from France that was popping up a bit online and at some retailers.\n\nI was curious about them then saw a set on the BST for cheap and figured why not. The set I acquired is [Zenith](https://es-rasage.com/en/collections/zenith) a \"Floriental\" scent as they describe it. I'll talk about the scent more later as this wasn't my focus it was the base itself. \n\n When we think France for shaving we think of the classics, [Martin de Candre](https://www.martin-de-candre.com/en/), [La Savonni√®re du Moulin](https://la-savonniere-du-moulin.com/), [Le P√®re Lucien](https://www.leperelucien.com/), and other similar brands. What most of these have in common except for LPL is that they are hard triple milled vegan base soaps, where LPL is a much softer artisan style soap in some various bases. E&S is more like a traditional artisan tallow base with goat's milk, lanolin and other butters, their base is as followed: \n\n> Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Caprae Lac, Glycerin, SodiumStearate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Safflowerate, Potassium Castorate, Parfum, Persea Gratissima Oil, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract, Sodium Shea Butterate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate Potassium Cocoate, Silk Powder, Stearic Acid, Potassium Lanolate, Sodium Cocoate, Allantoin, Sodium Lanolate, Tocopherol, Adeps Bovis, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuos Seed Oil, Cocianthus Annuus Seed Oil Nucifera Oil, Lanolin, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\n------\n\n**Loading & Lathering**\n\nThis soap took a bit to load, it could have been the brush I was using the tips were too soft, took a few seconds longer but got the brush loaded fine. Maybe some scrubbier tips would grab the soap easier but minor things people. \n\nThe lathering portion took a bit longer to get to where I wanted to but a few extra seconds of patience while properly hydrating lead to a very dense and heavy lather with a high water tolerance, I could have pushed it more but no need in my eyes. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI had 3 days of growth and my straight just wiped away the hair like nothing on the first pass. The lather is plenty slick for straights and for our DE users would have plenty of protection and cushioning. A 2 pass shave and some extra clean up left my face with a very nice DFS shave, BBS is impossible for me. The residual slickness felt very nice and good for clean up spots if needed. \n\n**The Splash**\n\nThe splash is pretty simple with the ingredients as followed:\n\n> Alcohol Denat., Hamamelis Virginiana, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Parfum, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\nI got a pretty big bite from it, not sure if it was the alcohol or scent but after 10 min my face was smooth and comfortable. It didn't have that super soft and tacky feel like some soaps and splashes give but it was just normal as the best way I can put it. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nI'm not going to focus on this much as I just cared about the base more, but Zenith is a warm floral scent, they describe it as: \n\n> The floral and spicy notes of ZENITH will bring you softness and well-being while leaving your skin delicately scented long after its application. Balanced fragrance, breath of freshness at the top with bergamot, the heart is warmed with enveloping notes of iris, jasmine and rose, and a base marked by the imprint of vanilla and the roundness of woody notes.\n \nTo me it was like a cousin of [Mickey Lee Soapworks - Bodhisattva](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/835/?product_type=soap). This scent isn't quite for me so will sell it.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nSimply put the best artisan soap out of France and a really good EU artisan base too, scents are different with a solid variety. I would personally ignore the splash if buying a soap, it's more than the soap and I don't think as good, but if you want to get it get it. But I wouldn't hesitate to try the soap new or used. \n\n**Disclaimer**: I already said it, bought it on the BST.",

The couple has been making soap, aftershave and body needs for 2 years. Their line up has flair and the vibe of the diversity synonymous with the city and region. Since my previous review of their Flora Colossus release in August 2017, the artisan team has updated their soap base and packaging. Both represent marked improvements and show their dedication to success. In addition to ordering direct, they can also be found at Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)) and Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)).\n\nTake Out Night is a fun accord inspired by the cuisine in America known as ‚ÄúChinese food‚Äù. Featuring notes of ginger, chili, lemon grass and fig, this accord packs a bold and unique punch. I am met first with the crip, sharp ginger and hints of spicy chili. A citrus flair folds into the mix and it is all rounded out by the sweetness of fig. This scent, while not traditional, is a real masterpiece and quire complex. Scent strength of this soap is mid-strong both lathered and smelled off the container. This scent is so unique I cannot offer any comparatives.\n\nLather Bros employs a tallow based soap formula. Ingredients include: Stearic acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Sodium Tallowate Adeps Bovis, Coconut Water, Aloe Vera Juice, Coconut Milk, Agua (water), Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Glycerin, Elaeis Guineensis (Palm) Kernel Oil, Garcinia Indica (Kokum) Seed Butter, Sodium Lactate, Essential, Fragrance Oils, & Bentonite Clay. The soap is mid to firm on the firmness scale. It is a thirsty soap base that explodes as you hydrate it. When properly dialed in the lather feels a lot like cool whip. The slickness, both primary and residual are very good. The post shave is excellent and leaves the users skin feeling soft and smooth. Lather Bros latest soap base gets a shavescore of 87, this represents a 10 point jump from the previous version I tried. Similar performing soaps in my experience are Through the Fire Fine Crafts and Jeeves of Hudson Street.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free,  sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Lather Bros Take Out Night (purchased)\n* Brush - Wolf Whiskers RCE#43 Juliet (purchased)\n* Razor - Modified Gold Dollar (gift)\n* Post - Through the Fire Fine Crafts Lakester (purchased)",

    "body": "**Video Link**\n\n[Abbate Y La Mantia \"Monet\" shave soap and aftershave](https://youtu.be/ITDpBctPgVw)\n\n**Disclosure Statements**\n\n* I bought the Maggard DE head with my own money, the handle was part of the iKon X3 razor sent for review by iKon\n* Abbate Y La Mantia provided the \"Monet\" shave soap and aftershave for review\n* DS Cosmetics provided the brush for review\n\n**Review**\n\nI know you were all thinking I was a **broken man** after my devastating loss in the Lather Games (did not even PLACE in the top 19!!), but here you can see that I am made of sterner stuff. Also, I am done crying myself to sleep every night.\n\n\"Monet\" represents a new chapter for Abbate Y La Mantia (AYLM). Previously their products have been produced by Tcheon Fung Sing (TFS) as their commercial partner, but that is no longer the case. AYLM has taken control of their manufacturing and are now making their own soaps and aftershaves. This also brings a new soap formula, based on coconut oil, castor seed oil, sunflower seed oil, along with rose hip and saffron extracts.\n\nThe soap is quite dark in color and very soft. I would recommend a light touch with a slightly damp brush to load; if you press down into the soap, you will load much too heavily. If you are using a dry brush, try gently pressing the tips of the brush into the soap to load. If you do add water, do so slowly, so that you can control the final density of the lather - this is a thirsty soap only if you load too much. Considering the spectrum of soap bases available today, this vegan soap delivers a light lather without any of the heavy or denser fats and butters in many of the other artisan soaps. Don't confuse light with airy or thin! The lather is still excellent, slick and creamy, with very good protection. Superior post shave with no tightness or dryness following the shave on the two days I skipped using any aftershave product to see how the soap would affect my skin.\n\nThe aftershave gets a makeover as well. While it still relies on the saffron extract, the most interesting feature is the different type of alcohol used in the aftershave, which comes from the fermentation of organic barley grain. I was really surprised the first time I used the aftershave because I fully expected a big alcohol hit from the aftershave, based on my experience with other AYLM aftershaves. Nothing! No sting! The aftershave feels smooth and cool going on, but without the expected alcohol sting. You still get the typical drydown from the aftershave, it is not meant to moisturize.\n\nThe scent is waterlily in both the soap and the aftershave. I would describe this as a slightly sweet, distinctly floral scent with a powdery undertone, on the strong side from the soap and stronger from the aftershave. The waterlily was Monet's favorite flower and the focus of a significant portion of his oeuvre, hence the name for this soap and aftershave combo. I quite like the scent, but if you are looking for a more traditionally masculine cologne style scent or don't like lighter, more fragrant floral scents, this may not be for you.\n\nAbbate Y La Mantia will be converting their entire line over to these two new formulations, and I will be picking up the Laureato soap and aftershave when those become available -- excellent shaves all week!\n\nI know you are all wondering about the Personna 74 blade. It has come to the end of the road for the blade at **53** shaves. I knew it was coming, based on how well it was cutting (or NOT cutting) the hair, but Thursday's shave made it clear -- the blade just has no cutting edge left. I was really hoping to make it to 100, but that is not going to happen with this blade. Maybe the next one?? We'll see!",

I use the butter daily, and carcass cleaner for wipe solution.\n\n\nRegarding Boudreaux's:\nGreen tube is totally fine for cloth.\n\n\n If your wash routine is good enough, you can get away with the petroleum on natural fibers. A big issue with most creams is the zinc -it stains.  If that's not a concern for you (and it will wash/sun out eventually) then go on with whatever.  I've used the red tube with disposables when my girl had a persistent rash, and there are still red stains a few months later in the one cloth diaper that got it.  Other diapers that I used a different brand of zinc cream with have white stains that are barely noticeable.",

The scent is a mix of sweet honeyed tobacco, vanilla, and light leather; the honey and vanilla give this a slight cherry hint. I would say the scent definitely falls on the sweeter side, with the tobacco and leather as undertones. Scent strength is pretty good both for the soap and the aftershave balm. I had a colleague remark on the scent mid-morning, so the scent does last. I really like how it smells, I find it cheerful and bright and it makes me smile.\n\nThis is a tallow soap that also contains sunflower seed oil, castor seed oil, and avocado oil. Cooper & French sent me their first tub of this soap, which is kind of cool, and it came in pretty hot - the soap is only a few days old and has not yet enjoyed the benefits of curing. The soap lathers easily and quickly, and slickness is very good. I have always enjoyed their soaps, and this is no exception. The lather feels a bit lighter and less heavy or fatty than some other tallow soaps, but that may also just be because it is so fresh. The lather is easy to rinse, and the residual slickness is on the lower side. To be fair, that may also have to do with the efficiency of the razor...not much left on the face after each pass! Post shave is pretty good, but not spectacular, with a bit of tightness or dryness after the shave. +1 point for using a #5 plastic container, which is recyclable in our area.\n\nThe aftershave balm is the new formulation, and is much better than I remember the previous version being. I think I described the previous balm as \"industrial\", but that is absolutely not the case with this new formula. The soap may be a bit drying, but the balm is wonderfully soothing and rich. This is a thick, creamy balm and exactly the texture I prefer. The balm applies easily and smoothly, absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel, and immediately makes your skin feel better. The balm is thick and you can feel it on your skin for a while. Very impressed with this version of the balm, and the scent strength adds to the overall experience. Good stuff!!\n\n**DS Cosmetic 26mm two band badger brush**\n\nThe third and final brush from DS Cosmetic, this time it's a 26mm two band badger. The knot was funky at first, but then I lathered up some Tabac, which by contrast made the funk seem positively delicious. I soaked the knot in a light white vinegar solution for 5 minutes, then rinsed, and did a few more cleaning lathers - no more funk!\n\nThe knot is really pretty nice: good density, soft tips, good balance of backbone and splay. No issues at all with the brush all week, and no reason not to recommend it as another good alternative in the ever-growing number of brush alternatives. The handle is a cool mixed swirl blue resin and is easy to hold, but I am becoming more and more convinced that I like the simpler barrel shape more than this handle alternative. Something about the hard segmentation actually makes it a little awkward in the hand, perhaps because I have larger hands (and size 15 feet, so YOU do the math...). If only somebody made a barrel shaped brush handle...\n\n**Muhle R41**\n\nNope. Not for me. I *can* shave with it, but I really *don't like* shaving with it. The razor is of course extremely efficient, but just not comfortable for me. I don't like how it feels on my skin, and I don't really like the feel of the shave. Yes, it tears through the hair, but the razor is clearly tuned for efficiency over comfort. I actually considered switching to another razor mid-week, but decided to stick it out. I have had tiny weepers almost every day and parts of my face are clearly still upset with me - thank goodness the Cooper & French balm is so good. I will keep the head, because it's part of my collection, but I think it will be quite some time before I come back to it. I just have too many other razors that work better for me, and I don't see any reason to suffer on purpose.\n\nI laid out all the products I still have in the queue to review, including some new ones I just got in the last few weeks, and a wave of despair rolled over me -- I feel bad that some of these have been sitting on the shelf since June! Then again, it just goes to show what an amazing array of products we have to choose from, and my wave of despair quickly turned to joy and anticipation with all the great stuff I will be shaving with in the weeks and months to come! I also will go through the collection and pull out the stuff I will be giving away at the end of the year, likely as a free-for-all at work for some of it, and some giveaways here and possibly YouTube for Christmas presents.\n\nTL;DR: [Dude, seriously?](https://youtu.be/1DR2d22RRSA)\n",

To those who mix their own: I salute you. I don't have the time or patience. I've noticed a lot of times someone takes a product they like, looks at the ingredients, then takes the most effective ingredient and uses that in their skin routine.\nI really like Orico's Superico Vitamin Rich Face Oil. I can buy almost all of the ingredients for it myself (safflower oil, jojoba, castor seed oil, rose hip, rice bran oil, geranium, lavender, bergamot, etc.) but I would rather buy the $47 bottle because of the convenience and the experience of putting it on, plus 100% of the ingredients are natural, and 73% are organic. If I bought just straight safflower and jojoba (which I'm assuming are really the most important ingredients), I wouldn't have the aromatherapy experience unless I bought the other oils as well (which sounds like a lot of work). I also enjoy the packaging, the luxurious feeling of the indulgence in myself, the whole thing. My knowledge on the benefits of different oils/ingredients is very small, but I'm assuming all of the ingredients in there do something.\nSo my question: Are the \"extra\" ingredients doing anything more for me than the \"essential\" ingredients? Is that difference negligible? If you mix your own product: Why do you do it? Is the ready-made product less effective than if I tried to replicate it myself? Is it about cost-effectiveness? Am I just a naive consumer? Discuss! ",

I bought extra because I plan to give some away here on **this very subreddit**.\n\nI bought the Przemys≈Çawka aftershave with my own money.\n\nI bought the Mongose with a LOT of my own money.\n\nI was gifted the Semogue Owners Club brush - great brush.\n\n**Review**\n\nSoap first. I grew up in Holland and therefore have a soft spot for all things Dutch, except for hondedrollen op de stoep. I have used the oldest shaving soap in the world, the Vergulde Hand, and now it's time to use a brand new artisan soap from Holland: Scheermonnik. Delft is a beautiful little town in Holland, and the packaging does help to evoke the feel of the town's skyline. The soap is vegan, with a coconut oil base and shea butter and castor seed oil. The soap is easy to lather, is good and slick, and made a nice protective lather: *another* good artisan soap, and yes, one among many.\n\nThe scent is a warm mix of woods and spices, as well as vanilla and bergamot; I found it quite pleasant but a little mild out of the container and tending to fade while lathering. For those of you who like a scent to punch you in the face, you will find this soap too lightly scented.\n\nThe Przemys≈Çawka aftershave is really an eau de cologne, and not at all one of the more modern artisan-style aftershaves. There is nothing \"skin-friendly\" in the aftershave, but that is not why I bought it. I bought it because it smells wonderful: a light citrus (and floral) powdery, old-school classic \"European\" aftershave scent. It is alcohol and scent, and I have applied it with wild abandon all week. The fact that it is made in Poznan Poland (where I travel frequently for business), and has been made there since 1919, just makes it all the more compelling for me.\n\nOk, the Mongoose. I bought one of the original 48, I think the razor is gorgeous and well-made, and I applaud their push to revitalize the SE market with (at the time) a new design. I can get a very good shave with the Mongoose, but I **do not like** the feel of that style razor blade. For some reason, the blade just feels uncomfortable and a bit harsh, even though it is 100% slicing through my beard. I hate leaving the Mongoose out of my regular rotation, so I will have to try some other blades besides the Feather Pro and Kai Mild.\n\nOne last thing: I know we have seen a bit of a dust-up in our moderation group, which is unfortunate, but I just wanted to say \"Thank you!\" to all the mods, current and former, who do put in the effort to keep this subreddit as good as it is.

Usually I avoid shaving soap with clay in them, but these two were interesting me and I couldn't resist.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nBoth soaps were used with a Plisson synthetic brush, a M√ºhle R41 head on a Maggard MR5 handle loaded with a Personna Red blade.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFirst off, [Local Gent Shaving Co. \"California Barber\"](https://i.imgur.com/u5nZ6dW.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPresentation: I received the \"export edition\" which is a shrink wrapped puck of soap with the DE razor blade shaped Local Gent logo stamped into one side, and the other side has a label like what you'd normally find on the lid of a jar. The label repeats the Local Gent logo, and the name of the scent is written in a 1950s/60s neon light style typeface. The jars and pucks available directly from the Local Gent website appear to have different (new?) labels. The soap is soft enough to smoosh into a shaving bowl or into an empty shaving soap jar, as I did.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nScent: Scent strength is on the lighter side of medium. California Barbershop is a clean scent that is light on powder and has an orange note in the top. It's a pleasant scent although if you already have a barbershop scent or two, perhaps it may not be unique enough to warrent a spot in your den.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPerformance: In the SOTD thread yesterday, I said it \"exploded into lather so quickly you'd think it was made of slick, white gunpowder\". The tallow based soap frothed up into a slippery and protective lather with no effort at all. Seriously, I picked up the brush, zoned out for a minute and before I knew it there was fantastic lather everywhere. Post shave it left my face feeling nourished and smooth.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIngredients: Water, Avocado Oil, Organic Tallow, Coconut Oil, Shea Butter, Stearic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide,Sodium Hydroxide, Bentonite Clay, Fragrance Oils.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPrice: AU$17.95 for 113g (4 Oz).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOverall: I like this soap a lot. The performance is tops and the scent is pleasant and would work with a great deal of my post shaves, which is always worth taking into consideration. Would I buy their soap again? Yes, yes I would. The bang for your buck is pretty strong with this soap, there's a lot of bang for not too many bucks, which only makes it more appealing.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNext up, [Faena Natural Products \"Aeolica\"](http://i.imgur.com/cbhuVh1h.jpg)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPresentation: Faena shaving soap comes in a tall-ish white jar that looks to be around 70-80mm wide (around 3\"), it's a little narrower than the jars from LASSCo. A Plisson isn't the largest brush in the world and it still filled the jar up without a lot of room to load, so a wider jar would be ideal. The black label is subtle and the colour of the text on the label differs depending on the scent.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nScent: Aeolica's strength is fairly light, but gets a little stronger once lathered. The scent is described as having \"notes of anise and thyme\". The anise note isn't like a mouthful of black jelly beans, which I'm sure would turn some people off. Overall it is sweet, yet subdued and fairly inoffensive. Being fairly light it shouldn't interfere with your aftershave.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPerformance: Some of Faena's shaving soaps are available in a vegan base, but \"Aeolica\" is a tallow based soap and also includes lanolin. The soap whizzes up speedily into terrific quality lather that has plenty of slickness and cushion. The post shave feel is very good, my skin felt soft without feeling like it was coated with a film.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIngredients: Tallow, water, coconut oil, stearic acid, castor seed oil, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, glycerin, kaolin clay, dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol, parfum. (I assume the dehydroacetic acid is to prevent fungi and bacteria and the benzyl alcohol is a preservative.)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPrice: AU$31.95 for 120g.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nOverall: This soap gave a pleasant shave, and look forward to using it again. Having said that, it's quite expensive and unless they came out with a scent that I absolutely *must* get a hold of, I'd probably not buy another one. You could buy two Proraso soaps, or nearly two Local Gent soaps, or Shaver Heaven, or Haslinger, or B&M Latha, etc. The bang for your buck isn't great here, the performance *is* great, but the price is a little steep. I guess the ‚Ç¨ to AU$ exchange rate is to blame.",

And from my research it seems it‚Äôs probably due to being a heavy virgin olive oil base. Both batches had majority of olive oil, which to my understanding causes it to take longer to cure. These were my recipes, which I made up using lyecalc for my recipe;\n\nFirst recipe -\n\n190g water\n62g lye 100% purity\n\n52g avocado oil\n103g jojoba oil\n202g extra virgin olive oil\n100g coconut, virgin unrefined\n50g castor seed oil\n\nSecond recipe -\n\n190g water\n70.5g lye, 100% purity\n\n50g argan oil\n100g avocado oil\n200g extra virgin olive oil\n150g coconut oil\n\n\n\nBoth seemed to mix pretty well though the trace I would feel was thin. I used an electric hand blender to mix, pulsed and mix for approximately 3 minutes or so, then poured into molds. I also added an essential oil to each one, though I only added 11 drops per each batch. I don‚Äôt think it made any crazy difference, I also added after I mixed and blended. \n\nAccording to the calculator, one batch was ideal and the other had low INS. Curious what the difference is between the two in person. All in all, very excited but definitely rough due to the patience required to actually be able to use them. Looking for any tips, critiques or criticism, suggestion, basically anything to improve my knowledge. Planning to sell these at future farmers markets. \n\nThank you so much for reading this!",

        "body": "First, congratulations on starting soap making! I entered your recipe into a calculator, here are some things to consider: the amount of water should be lessened. If your calculator has a default of ‚Äúas a percentage of oils‚Äù, you‚Äôll want to change to the water:lye ratio, 2:1 would be better and can go all the way down to 1:1. Lye only needs an equal amount of water to dissolve properly. Your first recipe will take a long time to harden because you‚Äôre using way more liquid oils than solid. Adding in Shea butter or another butter will help. If you really like jojoba keep it at 10% or less, too much adds to the softness of the bar. For the second recipe: that much coconut can feel too drying for a lot of people. The hardness on this one is much better. Too soft of a soap will wear down too fast. Lessening coconut and adding a butter will be less harsh. Also understand that jojoba and argan oils are very expensive. Most people won‚Äôt use those in soap, because they feel it‚Äôs a waste for a wash off product. But there are some who actually do. Anyways good luck & have fun. üòä",

I also generally try to avoid things like jojoba, aloe, cocoa butter, and other plant-derived ingredients if I can help it.\n\nI have two sticks of Neutrogena's original Norwegian Formula that I've been rationing for the last 5 or so years, dreading the day when the tubes run out because they no longer make it. I love it because it has SPF and it's also super moisturizing. I also love a stick form instead of a squeeze tube for ease of application, but I do use Vanicream's version of Aquaphor at night. To me a stick form lip balm is an essential that I want in my purse, my backpack, at my desk at work- always on hand and easy to apply, and goopy squeeze tubes do not fit that bill for me. Product details below. Has anyone seen/found anything similar? I've searched high and low (including SkinSafe) and tried/failed a lot of products to this point, so I'm hoping for as close a dupe as possible, but really anything without tocopherol and shea (and definitely no essential oils or plant extracts of any kind), but WITH sun protection would be my holy grail.

I know there is a WO guide but I thought that maybe there is another curly who has solutions to my problems)\n\nFor the past ten years I washed my hair once a week. I tried lots of different products like organic shampoo, baking soda, acv, tea rinse, oiling my hair, hair soap....my hair was always dry and broke off easily/had lots of split ends.\n\nTwo years ago I began following the curly girl method and started to use Shea Moisture shampoo, conditioner and gel. My hair looked and felt great. It was the first time in my life my hair felt soft and moisturized.\n\nAbout half a year ago I decided to buy less plastic and look for more environmentally friendly products for my hair. I already do so for my face and body. I want to keep things as natural and simple as possible, too. Plus I don't have a lot of time because I have a 5 month old baby.\n\nAt the moment I use(for the past 2-3 months):\n\nSkin Natur Shampoo Bar Sheabutter (Sodium Cocoyl Isethioniate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter organic, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil organic, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin)\n\nDIY Pre Poo for my dry scalp (distilled water, aloe juice, castor oil, hemp seed oil)\n\nDIY Conditioner (distilled water, aloe juice, baobab oil, babassu oil, vitamin e) --> it keeps my hair moisturized for 3-4 days; I can't apply to much because I don't have a lot of hair and it's thin + gets weighed down easily \n\nShea Moisture Gel (I want to use it up before I start making my own flaxseed gel or start using aloe vera gel)\n\n\nWO:\nA month ago I began washing my hair every other week with just water. I would like to transition slowly. I still apply my diy conditioner and gel to my ends.\nI don't brush my hair in between washes. I brush in the shower with fingers and wet brush. The day before I wash I massage my scalp and gently finger detangle my hair a little while dry. Then I apply my pre poo to my scalp and leave it in over night.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. My hair and especially the ends tend to get very dry during the week. Should I wash my hair with just water two times a week and then apply the diy conditioner to give it more moisture? (Before I used a refresh spray throughout the week that I no longer buy)\n\n2. I scritch and preen on the day before I wash and on wash day in the shower. Is that enough in transition phase? I don't brush my hair dry because it would look awful. At the moment my hair is greasy at the roots but I keep it in a bun on most days. It's not to bad. (I watched the video by shonaich \"preening curls\" and tried it but it stretched out my curls. Maybe I did it wrong and have to try again.)\n\n3. What is the routine of other WO curlies? Any tips are welcome.",

        "body": "I prefer combing my curls with a fine toothed wooden comb. I struggle to get a bbb through my hair, even when I had significantly less density than I do now, and even in sections. I know I came up with the curl preen, but I honestly don't do that much either, mostly just to encourage a shattered curl to reform between washes. You're right that it won't define curls as much as a water reset, but it does a better job than a technique meant for straight hair. It will help keep some curl definition, and will smooth and clean the individual curls, working with them instead of against them. \n\nI'm also not water only, my scalp won't let me. I do alternative washing, and moisturize with coconut water. I used to do an hour (at least) long moisturizing treatment once a week, but now it's incorporated into my wash, which makes things much more streamlined. My detailed routine is here\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/j7sxtp/tell_me_aboutalternative_washing/\n\nIf there's no gel in my hair after my wash, I'll preen some pure shea butter in and through it the morning after I wash, when my hair is dry. This helps seal in the moisturizing from the wash, and helps keep my hair settled. \n\nIf there's gel in my hair, 3-4 days after my wash when my hair is ready to reset again, I'll put some of the oil blend I made to stimulate hair regrowth on my scalp the morning before I shower, and preen some of it, or some pure shea butter, or a blend I made that's shea, cocoa butter and olive oil along and through my hair and make sure to get a good amount on my ends. That evening, I'll water wash and preen the oils I applied throughout my hair so they help it set up nicely. I might use an herbal rinse too, depends on what I need. The pulse flour, coconut water and marshmallow root routine super moisturizes my hair, and the oil helps seal it in. This works great until it's time to wash again.\n\nHere's my standard posts on mashing nopoo and curly girl techniques, including how I dry set my curls sometimes. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/fuw3fv/because_i_keep_talking_about_my_nopoo_curls_this/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/h8px3p/water_only_2x_a_week_for_a_month/fuucibe/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gc9sux/week_4_update_officially_4_weeks_wateronly_using/fpbn8mb/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/gm9v6k/preening_curly_hair/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/jomg0b/too_wavy_to_brush_not_curly_enough_not_to/gbkhb1z/",

I guess its just not an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù K-Beauty Routine Product that I used in my daily/weekly Routine. Anyway, I‚Äôll cover all that below‚Ä¶enjoy!\n\nProduct: Peach & Lily K-Beauty Rescue Balm\n\nProduct Size: 50ML/1.69OZ\n\nConsistency Of Product: Very Thick/Heavy Oil Based Balm\n\nStart Date Of Product: January 26th 2019\n\nUse #1 (The PMD Microdermabrasion Incident and K-Beauty Rescue Balm Discovery):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Back in early July I started using the PMD Microdermabrasion Tool. It‚Äôs a weekly At-Home Microdermabrasion Device that uses suction and a rotating Tip to remove the outmost (Dead Layer) of Skin. The 4 Tips range from Very Sensitive to Very Course‚Ä¶and I started with the Very Sensitive on Week 1 and built up from there. On the 4th Week‚Ä¶I decided to stay with the Moderate Tip (just under Very Coarse). Even though I had used it the previous Week‚Ä¶I guess my Skin was still sensitive from that or the Chemical Exfoliation I had done a few days earlier. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Either way‚Ä¶the Tool was much more aggressive this time around. Also, there were a couple of spots where I had neglected to move the Tool fast enough. That is a big no-no when using this PMD Tool as it can cause the Tip to over exfoliate. I ended up with some really raw/over exfoliated areas on my Cheeks/Left Temple and Neck. These were so raw that I ended up with some pretty nasty Scabs on those areas! YIKES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The day after this happened I was desperately looking for a Balm or SOMETHING that would help to soothe and repair these areas. I was browsing Ulta and decided to give the K-Beauty Rescue Balm a try. This Product uses a Formula packed with Oils and Soothing/Calming Extracts with the goal of providing much needed relief and recovery to the Skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* That night I applied this Product for the first time to the over exfoliated areas. I did this as my very last Step before bed. The Balm was super thick and heavy and didn‚Äôt really absorb into my Skin. Rather, it just kind of sat on top creating a barrier/occlusive layer. I was careful to massage the Product in as much as possible to avoid getting it all over my pillows!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I woke up the next morning to find my damaged Skin looked much better! The areas weren‚Äôt as red/inflamed‚Ä¶and the scabs on my Neck actually looked far more healed (or at least further along in the process!). I continued using the K-Beauty Balm each night until after about three days‚Ä¶when my Skin looked fully healed. For me, this recovery time seemed much shorter that I would have expected. Also, my worry of scarring was taken away since the recovered Skin seemed to be doing really well. I ended up not seeing many (if any) long lasting damage from my mistake!\n\nUse #2 (The Blackhead I REALLY Wanted Gone):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After finding the Peach & Lily K-Beauty Rescue Balm to be such a life saver‚Ä¶I began taking it with me in my travel bag. I kept it in mind often when I would see a potential breakout or issue on the horizon. But, once again‚Ä¶it was my own doing that had me reaching for this Product! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I had a really deep blackhead right on my Forehead and was having a really hard time getting to it. I typically do extractions once a week‚Ä¶but after two weeks this guy didn‚Äôt want to budge. Cut to me enjoying some homemade Bulgogi and Soju with my roommates‚Ä¶and afterwards that liquid courage got the best of me lol! I ended up in front of my mirror putting all my strength into forcing this blackhead out. I got it alright‚Ä¶but I also got a huge inflamed (and dare I say‚Ä¶bleeding) bump right on in the middle of my Face! I cleaned it up the best that I could and after about 30 minutes‚Ä¶I dabbed some Rescue Balm on this regret.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The injury scabbed over pretty quickly! Although it didn‚Äôt disappear in a few days like the issue before‚Ä¶I still think the scab came off/healed a bit faster than if I had not been applying the K-Beauty Rescue Balm. More importantly to me though‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt get the typical Acne Scar that usually comes along with my sometimes aggressive approach to Skincare lol!\n\nUse #3 (The Curious Case of the Drunk Elephant Marula Oil):  \n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Facial Oils have always been a bit allusive to me. My Oily/Combination/Sebum Factory of a Face has always kept me from exploring Facial Oils as I just couldn‚Äôt imagine putting MORE OIL on my Face as being productive lol! Once I started using K-Beauty (and just a solid Skincare Routine in general)‚Ä¶I became more and more comfortable with incorporating Products with Oil in them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After having a few failed attempts at using a Night Cream/Mask‚Ä¶I decided to give a pure Oil a try instead. My hope was that the Oil would act as an Occlusive Layer to lock in all the hydration from my Evening Lotions/Serums. Since I had a few Samples of the Drunk Elephant Marula Oil‚Ä¶I decided to give that one a try first. Bad idea lol!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My Skin reacted really poorly to the Marula Oil‚Ä¶and a few spots on my Cheeks and Chin (especially the little patches where I actually grow Facial Hair lol!) were very irritated and red the following morning. I honestly haven‚Äôt had that bad of a reaction to a Skincare Product in a long time‚Ä¶the Areas actually hurt to touch! Needless to say, I quickly grabbed the Peach & Lily Rescue Balm for some relief. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Once again this Product saved the day by calming my Skin down and reducing the redness. Over 24 Hours I was pretty much back to normal and didn‚Äôt have any long lasting/negative effects from the experience. I‚Äôd love to go into why I think that happened with the Marula Oil and what I am doing instead but I‚Äôll save that for another Post‚Ä¶its a lot of science-y information that would make this Post even longer than it is lol!\n\nOutside of these three instances‚Ä¶I have used the Rescue Balm on my cuticles and elbows when they were feeling dry/cracked. Although it did help a lot‚Ä¶the Formula was just a little too thick to feel comfortable (for me) during the day. I found the most value in it as a overnight ‚Äúfixer‚Äù. \n\nThe Formula for this Product includes Castor Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Beeswax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Carnauba Wax, Candelilla Wax, Turmeric Root Extract, Eggplant Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Eucalyptus Leaf Oil‚Ä¶and thats not even the full List!\n\nA little goes a really really long way and Peach & Lily provides quite a bit (in my Eyes) in the Tube‚Ä¶so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be getting a lot of use out of it. This Product is priced at $28.00 USD which I think is more than fair considering the help its been for me! I could totally see this as being a life saver for drier Skin Types since the consistency is just so rich and thick. \n\nIf you have the chance to give this Peach & Lily Product a try I would highly suggest it! Peach & Lily continues to offer some really amazing/results driven Products that I think will be making several appearances on my Best of 2019 K-Beauty List lol!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg9ee4intoo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca68508d60f6c37fcaaf5c59cd3df24c6b7ce74b",

If you're looking to stick with essential oils you can use something like a benzoin resin oil and vetiver combination to get a leather/musky scent. You can use sandalwood oil but with how pricey it is, you may want to substitute a cedarwood instead or use a pre-blended sandalwood mixture that's cut with some type of base oil. For the fresh scent something like eucalyptus would work or if you want it a bit more floral you could try lavender.\n\nAgain, I don't have any reference to this scent, but hopefully these suggestions can get you started.",

A week later I deworm him orally for spring and notice the hair is now more thin.\n\nI apply some castor seed oil and hope it improves two days ago I notice it's completely devoid of long hair and under fur chasmere layer. I'm taking him to the vet on Wed but wondering if there's anything I can do in the meantime. I'm located in the Gulf South and the weather has been up and down. Could it be ringworm? Parasites? Over rubbing? Stress?\n\n He seems happy and healthy otherwise. Thanks ",

I've heard that going no-poo can make hair look good without products, but I don't think I want to commit to that yet (and still doubt I'd be able to style my hair the same way if I did), so I'm not looking to go completely without shampoo but would like to at least reduce it to every few days.

Everything else is likely added in much smaller amounts for texture, stability, flavors, and label appeal. \n\nA really important note: your agave nectar and maple syrup are water based, so they won‚Äôt mix with your oily base. That‚Äôs why the original product contains ingredients like glyceryl rosinate and hydrogenated castor oil. They‚Äôre emulsifiers that help keep everything mixed and stable, but it also means that there‚Äôs much less nectar and syrup than you think.",

    "body": "Peach & Lily K-Beauty Rescue Balm\n\nAloha Everyone!\n\nThis Product Review is going to be a little different‚Ä¶\n\nWe‚Äôll cover the usual bases (Start Date, Size, Consistency, etc‚Ä¶), but rather than categorize an ‚ÄúOverall Review‚Äù‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to talk about the three specific instances that I‚Äôve actually had to use this Product lol! I guess its just not an ‚Äúordinary‚Äù K-Beauty Routine Product that I used in my daily/weekly Routine. Anyway, I‚Äôll cover all that below‚Ä¶enjoy!\n\nProduct: Peach & Lily K-Beauty Rescue Balm\n\nProduct Size: 50ML/1.69OZ\n\nConsistency Of Product: Very Thick/Heavy Oil Based Balm\n\nStart Date Of Product: January 26th 2019\n\nUse #1 (The PMD Microdermabrasion Incident and K-Beauty Rescue Balm Discovery):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Back in early July I started using the PMD Microdermabrasion Tool. It‚Äôs a weekly At-Home Microdermabrasion Device that uses suction and a rotating Tip to remove the outmost (Dead Layer) of Skin. The 4 Tips range from Very Sensitive to Very Course‚Ä¶and I started with the Very Sensitive on Week 1 and built up from there. On the 4th Week‚Ä¶I decided to stay with the Moderate Tip (just under Very Coarse). Even though I had used it the previous Week‚Ä¶I guess my Skin was still sensitive from that or the Chemical Exfoliation I had done a few days earlier. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Either way‚Ä¶the Tool was much more aggressive this time around. Also, there were a couple of spots where I had neglected to move the Tool fast enough. That is a big no-no when using this PMD Tool as it can cause the Tip to over exfoliate. I ended up with some really raw/over exfoliated areas on my Cheeks/Left Temple and Neck. These were so raw that I ended up with some pretty nasty Scabs on those areas! YIKES!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The day after this happened I was desperately looking for a Balm or SOMETHING that would help to soothe and repair these areas. I was browsing Ulta and decided to give the K-Beauty Rescue Balm a try. This Product uses a Formula packed with Oils and Soothing/Calming Extracts with the goal of providing much needed relief and recovery to the Skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* That night I applied this Product for the first time to the over exfoliated areas. I did this as my very last Step before bed. The Balm was super thick and heavy and didn‚Äôt really absorb into my Skin. Rather, it just kind of sat on top creating a barrier/occlusive layer. I was careful to massage the Product in as much as possible to avoid getting it all over my pillows!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I woke up the next morning to find my damaged Skin looked much better! The areas weren‚Äôt as red/inflamed‚Ä¶and the scabs on my Neck actually looked far more healed (or at least further along in the process!). I continued using the K-Beauty Balm each night until after about three days‚Ä¶when my Skin looked fully healed. For me, this recovery time seemed much shorter that I would have expected. Also, my worry of scarring was taken away since the recovered Skin seemed to be doing really well. I ended up not seeing many (if any) long lasting damage from my mistake!\n\nUse #2 (The Blackhead I REALLY Wanted Gone):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After finding the Peach & Lily K-Beauty Rescue Balm to be such a life saver‚Ä¶I began taking it with me in my travel bag. I kept it in mind often when I would see a potential breakout or issue on the horizon. But, once again‚Ä¶it was my own doing that had me reaching for this Product! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I had a really deep blackhead right on my Forehead and was having a really hard time getting to it. I typically do extractions once a week‚Ä¶but after two weeks this guy didn‚Äôt want to budge. Cut to me enjoying some homemade Bulgogi and Soju with my roommates‚Ä¶and afterwards that liquid courage got the best of me lol! I ended up in front of my mirror putting all my strength into forcing this blackhead out. I got it alright‚Ä¶but I also got a huge inflamed (and dare I say‚Ä¶bleeding) bump right on in the middle of my Face! I cleaned it up the best that I could and after about 30 minutes‚Ä¶I dabbed some Rescue Balm on this regret.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The injury scabbed over pretty quickly! Although it didn‚Äôt disappear in a few days like the issue before‚Ä¶I still think the scab came off/healed a bit faster than if I had not been applying the K-Beauty Rescue Balm. More importantly to me though‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt get the typical Acne Scar that usually comes along with my sometimes aggressive approach to Skincare lol!\n\nUse #3 (The Curious Case of the Drunk Elephant Marula Oil):  \n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Facial Oils have always been a bit allusive to me. My Oily/Combination/Sebum Factory of a Face has always kept me from exploring Facial Oils as I just couldn‚Äôt imagine putting MORE OIL on my Face as being productive lol! Once I started using K-Beauty (and just a solid Skincare Routine in general)‚Ä¶I became more and more comfortable with incorporating Products with Oil in them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After having a few failed attempts at using a Night Cream/Mask‚Ä¶I decided to give a pure Oil a try instead. My hope was that the Oil would act as an Occlusive Layer to lock in all the hydration from my Evening Lotions/Serums. Since I had a few Samples of the Drunk Elephant Marula Oil‚Ä¶I decided to give that one a try first. Bad idea lol!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My Skin reacted really poorly to the Marula Oil‚Ä¶and a few spots on my Cheeks and Chin (especially the little patches where I actually grow Facial Hair lol!) were very irritated and red the following morning. I honestly haven‚Äôt had that bad of a reaction to a Skincare Product in a long time‚Ä¶the Areas actually hurt to touch! Needless to say, I quickly grabbed the Peach & Lily Rescue Balm for some relief. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Once again this Product saved the day by calming my Skin down and reducing the redness. Over 24 Hours I was pretty much back to normal and didn‚Äôt have any long lasting/negative effects from the experience. I‚Äôd love to go into why I think that happened with the Marula Oil and what I am doing instead but I‚Äôll save that for another Post‚Ä¶its a lot of science-y information that would make this Post even longer than it is lol!\n\nOutside of these three instances‚Ä¶I have used the Rescue Balm on my cuticles and elbows when they were feeling dry/cracked. Although it did help a lot‚Ä¶the Formula was just a little too thick to feel comfortable (for me) during the day. I found the most value in it as a overnight ‚Äúfixer‚Äù. \n\nThe Formula for this Product includes Castor Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Beeswax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Carnauba Wax, Candelilla Wax, Turmeric Root Extract, Eggplant Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, and Eucalyptus Leaf Oil‚Ä¶and thats not even the full List!\n\nA little goes a really really long way and Peach & Lily provides quite a bit (in my Eyes) in the Tube‚Ä¶so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be getting a lot of use out of it. This Product is priced at $28.00 USD which I think is more than fair considering the help its been for me! I could totally see this as being a life saver for drier Skin Types since the consistency is just so rich and thick. \n\nIf you have the chance to give this Peach & Lily Product a try I would highly suggest it! Peach & Lily continues to offer some really amazing/results driven Products that I think will be making several appearances on my Best of 2019 K-Beauty List lol!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p173jftvtoo41.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6a4ddc4832ece40fc96fb0549681b2b67585ac6",

Curlscan not only tells you whether or not it‚Äôs CG, but also lists hot-button ingredients like aloe, coconut, protein, etc, that are helpful for finding products with ingredients you like, and without the ones you don‚Äôt. The advanced search on curlscan is also super cool; you select the type of product you want (conditioner, styler, leave in, etc), and you can select what ingredients you want, and which ones you‚Äôre trying to avoid\n\nEdit; curlscan‚Äôs downfall is that it does not have all products in its database. This is where curlsbot‚Äôs ingredient-based setup is helpful; it doesn‚Äôt need info on every product out there, just what ingredients aren‚Äôt CG",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nMy dog Truffle (10 months old) recently got flaky skin. First it was only on her groin, but now she got it on the rest of the body too - basically it looks like dandruff. \n\nI took Truffle to the dermatologist and she told me its nothing serious and to wash her with an oat shampoo. She recommended me one but it has SLS and I'm not sure about using it - is it not that good for hair and skin as it is with humans? I also found few different ones, but I don't think I know enough about dog hair and skin to pick the best one. \n\nI figured itd be best to ask professionals, I hope it's not a bad place to ask this question. Could you please help me choose one that won't make her condition worse and hopefully help soothe it?\n\nI'll post the ingredients as I'm from Poland so there's a very small choice of oat dog shampoos and I don't have access to most imported ones.\n\nSoap 1, recommended by the vet - dr Seidel shampoo with Oat and aloe Vera extracts (I'm not sure if I can use it because of SLS):\n\nAqua; Sodium Laureth Sulfate; Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate; Lauryl Glucoside; Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract; Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil; PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate; Lauramidopropyl Betaine; Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract; Allantoin; Panthenol; Urea; Lanolin; Sodium Chloride; Sodium Benzoate.\n\nSoap 2, bar soap made in Poland which smells of roses and contains oatmeal\n\nAqua, Elaeis Guineesis Oil, Cocos Nucifera Oil, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter*, Butyrospermum Park Butter*, Avena sativa Kernel Flour, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil; Geraniol Linalool, Citral, Limonene**\n\nSoap 3, also bar soap made in Poland, with honey and oatmeal (ingredienta list is from translator because it's really vague and incomplete in Polish, sorry)\n\ncoconut oil shampoo ingredients, honey, panthenol (provitamin B5), sodium lactate, cocoa butter, cetyl alcohol (fatty alcohol), tamanu oil, oatmeal, baking soda, preservative\n\n\nSoap 4, John Paul Pet Oatmeal Shampoo\n\nWater, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MIPA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Hydrolyzed Oat Protein, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fragrance (Parfum), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSoap 5, bio-groom natural Oatmeal soothing anti-itch shampoo\n\n2% (RAW) Colloidal Oatmeal USP, Purified Water, Cleansers Derived from Regrowable and 100% Biodegradable sources of Corn, Coconut and Palm Kernel Oils, Organic Amphoteric, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Bishydroxyethyl Dihydroxypropyl Stearammonium Chloride, Cocomide DIPA, Vegetable Glycerine, Aloe Vera, Citric Acid, Rainfall Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, MIT\n\nSoap 6, Beleko dog shampoo oats\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl, Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Collagen Amino Acids, Bisabolol, Avea Sativa Kernel Extract, Lavandula Officinalis Flower Oil, Juniperus Communis Fruit Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Lactic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\nSoap 7, Wahl Oatmeal Essense Shampoo\n\nAqua (Water),\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,  Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Sodium Chloride,  Glycol Distearate,  Parfum (Fragrance),  Coumarin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract,  Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil,  Cocamide MEA,  Amodimethicone,  Laureth-10,  Hydrolyzed Oat Protein,\nGuar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nThat's all the ones that I found in Poland.

I really enjoyed that one to. \n\nArtius Man has Castor Seed oil while Detroit Grooming does not. I liked the thickness that the Castor Seed oil brought to the table, not to mention the reported benefits of using it. \n\nThis brings me to the purpose of this post. What if I were to add Castor Seed oil to my favorite smelling oil? Has anyone doctored up their purchase oils in this manner? If so, how many drops per 1oz of oil should I start with?\n\nI guess I'm my perfect world, I would be able to just purchase the essential oil/fragrance blends separately and add them to the carrier blend that I mix. I know that I could also concoct my favorite essential oil/fragrance combo myself, but I'm not interested in running down that rabbit hole just yet!",

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou‚Äôre starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can‚Äôt pronounce an ingredient, don‚Äôt use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you‚Äôd be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you‚Äôd like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don‚Äôt want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you‚Äôll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

    "body": "Seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff is an inflammatory condition of the scalp, which increases the redness and excessive itching issues due to increased production of sebum. In this context, continuous scratching of the scalp can prove detrimental to the hair follicles, resulting in restricting natural hair growth, triggering hair thinning, and ultimately hair loss. \n\nSuch flaky dandruff issues tend to amplify in early adulthood and adolescence years, in which case persons with oily skin and blackheads may be prone to increasing hair fall problems. Thus, to effectively alleviate such grave issues of dandruff, and maintain healthy hair, it is quite imperative to regularly use the Ultimate Hair & Scalp Growth Oil from Sophistiquee Beauty to prevent Seborrheic Dermatitis scalp hair loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Find the unique tailored formulation of Ultimate Hair & Scalp Growth Oil to effectively treat Seborrheic Dermatitis scalp hair loss ](https://preview.redd.it/gzsob95ge4b91.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5b0d0f47a51e57d6a8a77b0525938e55e487345)\n\n**How Worthy Is the Hair and Scalp Treatments of Sophistiquee Beauty?**\n\nThe one-of-a-kind botanical and herbal extracts furnished with the top-of-the-line hair care product of the Ultimate Hair & Scalp Growth Oil from Sophistiquee Beauty aids in effectively thwarting hair loss issues from dandruff. This exclusive hair rejuvenation product optimally assists in accelerating the robustness, volume, abundance, and proliferation of the hair. \n\nThe essential ingredients of the hair care product comprise organic Amla extract, rosemary, basil, soybean, and castor seed oil, along with lavender and peppermint oil, hibiscus, Brahmi, passionflower, bhringaraj, nettle, menthol, comfrey, camphor, and capsicum helps in preventing hair thinning and loss. Bringing in effective scalp stimulation, the unique hair care formulation brings life to the hair by rendering cellular hair restoration, and sensory regeneration, along with thicker and complete hair growth. \n\n**What Are The Effective Treatment Options Available For Dandruff Remedies?**\n\n**Antifungal Products and Ointments**\n\nTreating dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis and minimizing the proliferation of itching, inflammation and irritation on the scalp can be effectively reversed by the application of external topical ointments and antifungal hair care products. These highly functional antifungal shampoos, creams, lotions, and gels comprise discrete ingredients such as 2.5% selenium sulfide, 1% zinc pyrithione, 1% miconazole and bifonazole, 2% ketoconazole, and 1.5% ciclopirox olamine. \n\n**Other Topical Remedies**\n\nAmongst other topical treatments available for hair care are shampoos that comprise lithium gluconate, coal tar, phototherapy (UVB), and metronidazole help to avert scalp inflammation and itching. \n\n**Discrete Natural Remedies** \n\nDifferent organic treatments for checking hair loss can be effectively treated with aloe vera, tea tree oil, honey, and lemon. With anti-inflammatory attributes, the aloe vera gel can optimally ease off the irritation and itchiness of the scalp. Besides, one can use a mix of lemon juice and yoghurt on the dandruff-prone scalp, leaving it for 20 minutes, and subsequently washing it with an organic shampoo. \n\nAgain, tea tree oil comes with antifungal properties to treat dandruff. In this context, the affected individual can add some drops of rosemary oil with the tea tree oil, and apply it to the scalp. Nevertheless, some essential oils might also prove to be allergic to the skin, wherein the users are recommended to indulge in a patch test before applying it to the affected scalp and hair. \n\nIn addition, honey is also utilized in conventional medications to ease off the inflammation and itchiness that is triggered by seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff. In this process, one should mix honey with water, and use it on the affected scalp area, and subsequently rinse it. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nTaking into contemplation of the unique treatment options offered by Sophistiquee Beauty with their formulation of Ultimate Hair & Scalp Growth Oil for [Seborrheic Dermatitis scalp hair loss](https://sophistiqueebeauty.com/products/ultimate-hair-scalp-growth-oil), it is quite relevant that it helps in optimally energizing the scalp and alleviating hair follicle damage.",

    "body": "I have looked high and low, and tried dozens upon dozens of products to keep my lips moisturized and chap-free, and have finally found my HG in Paula's Choice Lip & Body Treatment Balm; the problem is, it seems to go out of stock quite frequently, it's quite expensive (I am in Canada, so the shipping plus initial cost is fairly high for what you get), and it takes a while to arrive (so if I let myself get to low on it, I have to go a while without). \n\nAre there any products that are similar? The ingredients list is: \n\nRicinus Communis Seed Oil (castor oil/non-fragrant oil/emollient), Petrolatum (emollient), Euphorbia Cerifera Wax (candelilla wax/emollient/texture-enhancing), Lanolin (emollient), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters (emollient/skin replenishing), Cera Alba, (beeswax/texture-enhancing), Ozokerite (texture-enhancing), Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient), Copernicia Cerifera Wax (carnauba wax/emollient/texture-enhancing), Butyrospermum Parkii Butter (shea butter/emollient/antioxidant), Jojoba Esters (emollient), Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil (wheat germ oil/non-fragrant oil/emollient), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (vitamin C/antioxidant), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant), Trihydroxystearin (emollient), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (emollient/texture-enhancing)\n\nI have tried to look for products that have similar ingredients, and they usually are too \"slippery\" or \"greasy\" feeling. \n\nAny suggestions would be very greatly appreciated!",

My lips tend to be very dry in the summer regardless of what lipstick I have on, so I usually reapply lip balm before reapplying my lipstick throughout the day. With the Slip Shine, I could just pop it on alone after the initial application. I'm not a glitter/shimmer-on-the-lips kind of person at all but the shimmer is very subtle, not at all bothersome. I expected the color to be slightly patchy or settle in the lip lines, but that wasn't a problem. I wore Glazed in the morning and tried on Tang Thang later in the day. I haven't tried out the others I own yet, but both I wore had the same qualities so the formula seems consistent across shades. I was pretty impressed by them!",

They are soft and painless. It took between 5-12 months for them to \"pop\" and they healed on their own within a few weeks after that. One got poked open by a needle from an opthamatologist which caused more problems than it actually helped. Anyways I was free from lid bumps for 2 months and now they came back. What can I do? And what makes them appear in the first place?\n\n**My routine:**\n\n* Clean eyelids with Naviblef lid scrub, rinse with lukewarm water and apply 0.02% HOCL with a cotton bud along the lid margins. Apply Optimel Manuka honey on the lid margins and eyelids for each eye with a cotton bud. Repeat this exact routine in the evening.\n* I apply a usb heat mask once a day at 40¬∞C for 10 minutes, then I blink 20 times real hard to squeeze the meibomian glands in a natural way.\n\nWhen I use screens for a longer time or drive in a car for 1+ hours I experience discomfort and dryness/slight burning sensation. 95% of the time my symptoms are fine and I don't use eye drops.\n\nMy average screentime combined: 2-4 hours /day\n\nSupplements according to recent blood work: Omega-3, Vitamin B complex, Vitamin D+K2\n\nAdditional information: M23, European, vegan, I drink about 2 - 2.5 litres water a day\n\nToday I completed a 30 day detoxication cure which consisted of zeolite, probiotics, vitamin b complex, l-glutathion, dandelion extract, nattokinase, spirulina, baikal skullcap, opc.

I'm wondering if the company booheads that produces recycled plastic toothbrushes with plant based bristles (tho they say also that it might be a blend of nylon and castor oil??) is legit. It says its FSC certified and more. \n\nI already have an oral b electric toothbrush, and to not make more waste, I ideally would just want to purchase more non-plastic toothbrush heads. Also, there is the fact that toothbrush heads produce mechanical wear of the bristles through contact with our teeth, which would necessarily produce a significant amount of microplastics that both we can accidentally ingest (especially if you do not rinse your mouth after brushing like your'e supposed to do in order to let fluoride in the toothpaste do its thing), and which would enter water streams/sources around us from our sink water.\n\nAny other solutions? I know that the sustainable tomorrow produces bamboo electric brushes with castor seed oil bristles. That in theory would get rid of problem of constantly shedding microplastics into our bodies and the water around us from brushing (ideally) twice a day. \n\nAre there any fully legit non plastic toothbrush heads and brushes that are electric that you know of? anything else as a solution?",

The oil is thus a potential alternative to petroleum-based starting chemicals for the production of materials with variety of properties. \n\nCastor oil as a potential renewable resource for the production of functional materials (2016)\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40508-016-0055-8\n\n>A range of SMOC have been reported as being derived from the pyrolysis of different types of triglyceride materials. Soybean oil and Castor oil in a batch system at a temperature of 350 ¬∞C yielded alkanes (C11‚ÄìC15), alkenes (C11‚ÄìC15), carboxylic acids (C7‚ÄìC11) and aldehydes (C11‚ÄìC15) and alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones of C15‚ÄìC16 and carboxylic acids of C11‚ÄìC12 with a higher portion of oxygenated products, respectively (Lima et al. 2004). The pyrolysis of palm oil at 375 ¬∞C yielded saturated fatty acids, hydrocarbons and some oxygenated products (Twaiq et al. 2004). Similarly, the pyrolysis of canola oil in a flow reactor at 400 ¬∞C produced alkenes and aromatics (Idem et al. 1996). Also, the pyrolysis of the soap of palm and rapeseed oils at 750 ¬∞C gave saturated hydrocarbons, while castor seed oil gave ketones and phenols (Hanna 2011).....\n\n>In the pyrolysis of soybean and palm tree oil, hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids were found to be in the range of C7‚ÄìC15 whereas the hydrocarbons and carboxylic acids yielded in the pyrolysis of castor oil were in a considerably narrow range of C15‚ÄìC16 and C11‚ÄìC12 respectively (Lima et al. 2004). However, castor oil gave more oxygenated products such as ketones and phenols (Hanna 2011) which were not found in the pyrolysis of RSO.\n\nStudy on small molecular organic compounds pyrolysed from rubber seed oil and its sodium soap (2016)\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788666/",

At the same time there are various treatments available for prevention and regrowth of hairs. Lets evaluate the pros and cons - oral vs. topical hair regrowth treatment - or should you use them both?\n\nThere are two main types of capsules, hard shelled and soft gel. Hard-shelled capsules consist of two halves. Among them the one that carries medication is called LHFC. Airtight LHFCs can contain more than one drug. Soft-gel capsules are usually semi-transparent as opposed to opaque. Capsules are fast acting, tasteless, and have higher drug absorption.\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qzkb80jgun91.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf3a4faaa272ad8099a19057b074a0834df1f4d5\n\nHowever there are certain drawbacks in capsules which should be known so that we can take a judicious call while choosing any treatment - hair or otherwise. Capsules are less durable, have shorter shelf life and may contain animal products that may make them unsuitable for vegans. Additionally most capsules contain additives; especially softgels tend to have a higher number of synthetic ingredients. When capsules are taken orally, the ingredients circulate the body, affecting it systemically.\n\nSince we're talking about saw palmetto, for example, many take saw palmetto orally (capsule form). While you can source high quality capsules, if taken to promote hair regrowth, what is the amount of benefit directly to your scalp?  \n\nHere we find the main benefit of topical application of scalp treatments; most of which are unavailable if treatment is solely in the form of oral medication.\n\nOils help soften the strand, nourishes the hair with vital essential fatty acids, reduces dry flaky scalp, balances sebum production and strengthens the roots. While deciding on using topical hair oil, its well advised to ensure that it contain anti-inflammatory properties, since inflammation is often the underlying reason for hair loss. If left on for a few hours, oils will saturate the roots, delivering the nutrients where they are needed most, instead of circulating the body.\n\nHAIRMETTO¬Æ Topical Oil is one such oil which is used by thousands due to its chemical free characteristics, scientifically proven ingredients to promote hair regrowth and ease of application. It is made up of botanical plant extracts and various medicinal oils, each one of them chosen for its unique properties to protect, repair and restore.\n\nWhen applied topically with the exact placement twist-top cap, the oils permeate the scalp, delivering the soothing and medicinal benefits right where it is needed. \n\n[Saw Palmetto](https://myhairmetto.com/blogs/news/saw-palmetto-supercritical-co2-extraction?_pos=2&_sid=f736ad90e&_ss=r) is one among the medicinal oils. It is rich in essential fatty acids and its extract works to inhibit DHT in the scalp. When DHT flows freely through the bloodstream, it binds to the receptors on the hair follicles. Once DHT has a grip on the hair follicle, it causes the follicle to weaken, miniaturize and ultimately the hair will fall away, leaving a non-thriving follicle without the environment to grow a new hair in its place.\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfs2fmuhgun91.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3634b6c9744a94e634d2884f2e649a7ed40e0664\n\nIn addition to Saw Palmetto, Pumpkin seed oil, Castor seed oil and Stinging Nettle are other herbs and organic extracts that are used in the production of HAIRMETTO¬Æ which is fast becoming a preferred choice among those who believe in natural and [pharmaceutical side-effect free hair treatment](https://myhairmetto.com/pages/no-drug-related-side-effects-why-is-this-important?_pos=1&_sid=1ce3dc654&_ss=r).\n\nOther important ingredients in HAIRMETTO¬Æ are Rosemary, Lavender and Cedarwood extract which are known for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Another key ingredient is Peppermint oil which is found to improve blood circulation to the follicles, promoting the lengthening of the growth phase of the hair.\n\nTogether these ingredients have raised hopes among those who have preferred natural over synthetic when it comes to hair treatment. When it comes to [choosing saw palmetto](https://myhairmetto.com/blogs/news/does-it-matter-how-its-made?_pos=3&_sid=f736ad90e&_ss=r) in either capsule form or topical oil, some choose to supplement with both. Remember, the topical Oil will be placed exactly where your scalp needs it most - delivering the benefits right to the roots! \n\nDo not forget to check out our complete product range: [https://myhairmetto.com/collections/frontpage](https://myhairmetto.com/collections/frontpage)",

I know a lot of ingredients in low concentrations are totally safe, like sodium hydroxide used to stabilize the ph so I'm not sure if this is a similar thing?\n\nAnyway here are the ingredients please let me know if theres anything else in here that could possibly be sensitizing. This is the first time I've ever had a skin reaction from a hair product so I'm freakin out lol.  \n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Maleic Acid, Ethanolamine, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Parfum/Fragrance, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil/Castor Seed Oil, Quaternium-91, Polyquaternium-37, Benzoic Acid, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Ppg-1 Trideceth-6, Benzyl Benzoate, Biotin, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Acrylates Copolymer, Linalool, 2-Oleamido-1,3-Octadecanediol, Sorbitan Oleate",

        "body": "I‚Äôm not sure why they list ethanolamine so high in the list. It is a base used to raise the pH. Many of the conditioners require an acidic pH to function. The malic acid will do that since it‚Äôs higher up the list. This means the irritation potential referenced in hair color wouldn‚Äôt really apply in this case. \n\nIn general, if irritation develops when using a product, stop using it to see if it is the cause versus something else.",
