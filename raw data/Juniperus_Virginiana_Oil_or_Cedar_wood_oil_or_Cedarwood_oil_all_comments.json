    "body": "Hi LUSH friends, back on here again with another haul & review! This time I‚Äôve gone for the newly released Christmas products on the app, plus some community shower gels before they‚Äôre all gone! Don‚Äôt worry, this is a Snow Fairy safe space! Warning, this is a long post. üòº\n\nThe main inspiration for this order was they finally released the perfume I‚Äôve waited so long for, Turmeric Latte! This has always been a favourite scent of mine and foolishly I only got a 30ml last year, which definitely wasn‚Äôt enough!\nOn the initial spray it is a strong cinnamon scent, with a heavy benzoin kick that works wonderfully with it. Once the smell settles and heats on your skin, the warm and lovely Cinnamon and Benzoin mixed with the Vanilla & Tonka Absolute to become a lovely, cosy and comfortable scent. \nIt feels like sitting beside a warm fire in your favourite warm pyjamas, drinking a mulled wine and listening to Christmas music. The sillage and longevity is crazy, too! I‚Äôve worn it now for most of the day and I can still strongly smell it on myself as the fragrance has subtly changed over time.\nMy number #1 favourite fragrance from LUSH and will always come strongly recommended! Limited time, so make sure you grab it before it‚Äôs gone!\n\nYou never just order one thing from LUSH though‚Ä¶ and it isn‚Äôt Xmas without Yog Nog so, of course, I had to get both the shower gel and the body spray! I‚Äôll review these together.\nThe label on the spray says ‚Äúbutterscotch, cinder toffee, clove and ylang ylang‚Äù and you can absolutely smell all of these. This scent is so absolutely delicious that I wish I could eat it. Warm, sweet, fiery, it is everything that Xmas needs to be. It lasts quite a while, too! \nIt is a similar scent profile to sticky dates in that it is very sweet, with less of that cloying sweetness though and more a bold mixture of darker and warmer fragrances working together to be complex and moreish. Definitely similar to a big bag of cinder toffee on bonfire night!\n\nThe ingredients on the shower gel are much the same, with a few changes. There is Maple Syrup, Fine Sea Salt, Gardenia Extract, Titanium Dioxide for the colour, and of course, tons of plastic free and vegan glitter to give it the signature look of molten gold. Be careful to rinse your tiles and bath after! \nThe smell is very similar, just a little more dilute as there is no alcohol, but I found really amazing results using this and then the spray on my body afterwards once I‚Äôd dried! It smelled a great deal stronger than just doing one alone.\nIt‚Äôs very moisturising too, I felt very soft and smooth after. Definitely one I plan to use in the evenings before a nice sleep. Sorry, Sleepy Shower Gel! You‚Äôve got a new competitor.\n\nContinuing with shower gels and spicy scents, Skinny Dip is a very different scent to how I imagined! It‚Äôs actually delicious and warm. I assumed it would smell a bit lighter but it‚Äôs very bold!\nThe main ingredients for the scent are Clove Bud Oil, cold-pressed Murumuru butter, Coconut Infusion, Cedarwood Oil, Clary Sage Oil, Palmarosa Oil, Vetivert Oil & Ylang Ylang Oil! Definitely a bold and complicated scent profile which explains why I can‚Äôt place it to anything else, but it‚Äôs definitely warm and spicy! Sincerely hoping this becomes a permanent addition to the range.\n\nFinally, we‚Äôve got Sultana, based on the classic Sultana of Soap! On the ingredients we have Apricot Infusion, Currant Infusion, Cranberry Infusion, Olibanum Oil & Bergamot Oil.\nThis is a very fruity but mature scent. Think less ‚Äúfruit cocktail on the beach‚Äù and more ‚Äúfancy restaurant dessert with a fruity, currant reduction‚Äù as that‚Äôs how it feels to smell! Not overly bright smelling, but still sweet and cleansing. \n\nThanks for reading, hope you enjoyed my thoughts on these products! Please do comment if you get them too, I‚Äôd love to know how you feel!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai ü§°\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* : ¬†Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin‚Äôs DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn‚Äôt penetrate beyond the skin‚Äôs superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi üíÄ)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask üòñ. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn üî•üî•. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 ü•µ)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ‚óè ALCOHOL DENAT. ‚óè TRIETHYL CITRATE ‚óè DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ‚óè SILICA ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ‚óè BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ‚óè ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ‚óè BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ‚óè GLYCERIN ‚óè PROPANEDIOL ‚óè C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ‚óè SODIUM CITRATE ‚óè METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ‚óè PERLITE ‚óè TOCOPHEROL ‚óè CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ‚óè ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ‚óè CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ‚óè CITRIC ACID ‚óè DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ‚óè DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ‚óè HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ‚óè TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ‚óè TRIETHANOLAMINE ‚óè TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ‚ú®lazy‚ú®\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?ü•≤ hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai ü•≤\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this üòñ somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao ü§° maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see üëÄ / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less üòñ if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop üò≠. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)üò≠üò≠~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/‚ÄãPPG-10/‚Äã1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is üî•üî•üî•. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool ü§§ only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty üòñ I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao üòå so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier ü•≤. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

Why?\n\nWell, even if you're a literalist, you'd still like to know what kind of wood the Ark was made of. \nSo first the term itself.\n\n>Gopher wood or gopherwood is a term used once in the Bible for the substance from which Noah's ark was built. **Genesis 6:14 states that Noah was to build the Ark of gofer**, more commonly transliterated as gopher wood, a word not otherwise known in the Bible or in Hebrew. Wikipedia\n\nAnd I'm just gonna dive right in.\n\nFirst Hebrew didn't have vowels the same way other languages do. So Gofer would have been written down as GFR. And that's a clue right there.\n\nNext clue?\n\nSame verse in Genesis...\n\n>rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.\" Genesis 6:14, NASB: ...\n\nPitch (together with wood) suggests resinous wood. Something perhaps like pine. The use of pine resin for making boats and ships water tight is well know. For example, Native American Indians used pine pitch in the construction of their marvelous canoes.\n\nSo now we've got a potential lead. Let's follow it and see if we can find something else to help make our case.\n\nPine and other evergreen trees are very fragrant. Anyone who's ever been close to any kind of pine or cedar tree knows exactly what I'm talking about. Same thing goes for being in a freshly built log cabin or even close to furniture made of such wood.\n\nWhy does it smell nice?\n\nMostly because of a range of chemical aromatic compounds like terpenes.\n\nCedar:  \n\n>The main chemical components of cedarwood oil are a-cedrene, b-cedrene, thujopsene, other sesquiterpenes, cedrol and widdrol.\n\nPine:\n\n>Chemically, pine oil consists mainly of Œ±-terpineol and other cyclic terpene alcohols. It may also contain terpene hydrocarbons, ethers, and esters. The exact composition depends on various factors, such as the variety of pine from which it is produced and the parts of the tree used.\n\nAnd there's one more tree, the Gofer wood tree itself:\n\n> a-pinene, camphene, sabinene, b-pinene, d-3carene, myrcene, a-terpinene, terpinolene, linalool, bornyl acetate, cedrol and cadinene\n\nWhich tree is this? \n\nIt's the Cypress tree. \n\nCyprus is named after this tree. It grows all over the Holy Land as well. It was imported from there to Italy by the Etruscans\n\n>The cypress tree is synonymous with Tuscany, although it is not native to Italy. The cypress probably came to Tuscany thousands of years ago, likely with Etruscan tribes. The Etruscans revered the cypress because they thought it had supernatural powers.\n\nNot so much supernatural as healthy and emotionally uplifting (basically ancient aromatherapy). And it gets even more convincing if we look at the origin for the name itself.\n\n#cypress\n\n>/Ààs å…™pr…ôs/\n\n\n>Origin\n\n>Middle English: from Old French cipres, from late Latin cypressus, **from Greek kuparissos** .\n\nFrom the Greek Kuparissos... or kupar - issos\n\nKupar means the same thing as the semitic Gofer or  (later Arabic) Qafoor. In Sanskrit, there is a word for the same substance called Kapoor. And what is this stuff?\n\nWe call it Camphor.\n\nAnd Cypress trees have camphor.\n\n>Camphor is a waxy, flammable, transparent solid with a strong aroma. It is a terpenoid with the chemical formula C‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜO. It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel, a large evergreen tree found in East Asia, also of the unrelated kapur tree, a tall timber tree from the same region. Wikipedia\n\nCypress was named after the way it smells. I couldn't say which name came first, the tree or the smell... it's a chicken and egg thing. But that's a side track. The Greek name kuparissos is like a description that means kupar-ish. In English we'd say camphoraceous (which is phonetically similar to kuparissos)\n\nGofer = Qafoor = Kupar (cypress) = Camphor  \n\nMystery solved.\n\nIt just so happens that I have a cypress tree growing right outside my front door. It's there because my wife likes those trees and it was her idea to plant it. I'm looking at it differently now every time I walk by.\n\nEdit: Another user asked me a question and I expanded/explained a bit more.

For whatever reason, we do have a tendency to let our beliefs and emotional reactions (feels) get in the way of facts (reals).\n\nThere‚Äôs a link in the sidebar to a page about ‚ÄúEssential Oils in Haircare‚Äù.  This set off crazy warning bells: essential oils are not something with which to be tinkering around.  This is about 7000 times more true if they are being used topically, rather than for aromatherapy, which is how the linked website (and many of this subreddit‚Äôs users) recommend using them.\n\nJust because something is ‚Äúnatural‚Äù or derived from a plant does not mean it‚Äôs a-okay for your skin.  There‚Äôs no market out there for poison ivy tea rinses, after all.  I want to work through (for now) the oils specifically mentioned on the linked page, since that is what the subreddit ‚Äúadvocates‚Äù or is, at least, what most users will find when looking into essential oil use.\n\n‚ÄîTHE LINE-UP‚Äî\n\nBASIL: first up, this essential oil has some compounds that are going to be old friends by the time we get through this: linalool and eugenol.  This are BOTH documented irritants that you should avoid in any skin care product. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/basil-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/linalool)\n\nCHAMOMILE: this one checks out; it doesn‚Äôt appear to be widely irritating in general, though some people with allergies to the daisy family may have issues. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/chamomile)\n\nCEDARWOOD: this is a fragrance, and like many fragrances, can be irritating and allergenic.  There is also, apparently, some research which found it to cause tumors on mouse skin.  The evidence is far, far from conclusive, and even if there were more studies with similar results, ‚Äúcorrelation is not causation‚Äù would still apply.  However, if you‚Äôre going to freak out about parabens or whatever, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to use cedarwood oil. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/cedarwood)\n\nCLARY SAGE: this is tagged with the Risk Number* R38, marking it as irritating to the skin.  Don‚Äôt put it on your scalp, fer Pete‚Äôs sake. (http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB9340183.htm)\n\nEUCALYPTUS: this is a fragrant oil which, as the sidbar-linked website says, may well have some anti-fungal and anti-microbial effects.  HOWEVER, some of its components are known irritants.  \"Truly a mixed bag, because this oil, like rosemary oil, is one that has benefits and risks. Because the risks are primarily with topical application to skin, eucalyptus oil is an ingredient to avoid‚Äù (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eucalyptus-oil)\n\nLAVENDER:  STOOOOOOOOOOOOP putting lavender essential oil anywhere near your skin. The ‚Äútingling‚Äù feeling that many people describe isn‚Äôt lavender oil stimulating your bloodflow or anything, it‚Äôs the oil irritating and damaging your skin.  You do NOT want to experience tingling with any product you apply topically: it is your body sending you distress signals.  Lavender is so, so misunderstood, so I‚Äôm going to quote the whole article:  \n\n\"Of particular concern is the lavender oil, which smells great but causes havoc on skin. Research indicates that components of lavender, specifically linalool, can be cytotoxic, which means that topical application causes skin-cell death (Source: Cell Proliferation, June 2004, pages 221‚Äì229). Lavender leaves contain camphor, which is a known skin irritant. Because the fragrance constituents in lavender oil oxidize when exposed to air, lavender oil is a pro-oxidant, and this enhanced oxidation increases its irritancy on skin (Source: Contact Dermatitis, September 2008, pages 143‚Äì150). Lavender oil is the most potent form, and even small amounts of it (0.25% or less) are problematic. Although it‚Äôs fine as an aromatherapy agent for inhalation or relaxation, it is a must to avoid in skin-care products. (Sources: Psychiatry Research, February 2007, pages 89‚Äì96; and www.naturaldatabase.com).\"\n\n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/beautypedia-skin-care-reviews/by-brand/bio-oil/_/Bio-Oil)\n\nLEMON: this provides no demonstrated skin care benefits, but can be both irritating and photo toxic, i.e. reactions may result following exposure to sunlight.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemon-oil)\n\nLEMONGRASS: this is another fragrant, volatile oil which contains the same compounds that make lemon oil (above) irritating to the skin. ( http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/lemongrass-oil)\n\nMYRRH: another one that contains limonene, an irritant also found in the two oils above, as well as pinene (see ‚Äúvolatile oil\" description below) and eugenol, which you also don‚Äôt want on your body. (http://www.baseformula.com/product.php/6670/myrrh-essential-oil), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/eugenol)\n\nPATCHOULI: this is derived from mint, can sensitize skin, and contains eugenol (see myrrh, above) which is an irritant.  Patchouli is considered a ‚Äúcounter irritant‚Äù, for which see below for a full explanation. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/patchouli)\n\nPEPPERMINT: it‚Äôs another counter-irritant; move along. (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/peppermint)\n\nROSEMARY: this one kind of almost barely checks out.  In very, very small quantities rosemary EXTRACT can be okay, but if you look at the main constituents of rosemary OIL, it‚Äôs a whole lot of known irritants: pinene, borneol, linalol, camphor, etc. (http://www.aromaweb.com/essential-oils/rosemary-oil.asp), (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/antioxidants/rosemary-extract)\n\nSAGE: I feel like this is starting to get repetitive: it‚Äôs a fragrant oil, and all the usual, skin-annoying compounds are there, including camphor.  Nope.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/sage-extract)\n\nTEA TREE: Fiiiiiiiiiinally!  This one kind of checks out too!  It can have anti-inflammatory effects and seems effective at treating certain skin conditions.  However, that doesn‚Äôt mean you should go whapping it all over your head: it still contains components that can cause issues, so it should STILL be treated with extreme caution.  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/tea-tree-oil1)\n\nTHYME: once again, fragrance compounds found in thyme oil are undesirable on your skin.  Billionth verse, same as the first, no?  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/thyme-oil)\n\nYLANG YLANG: allllllllllll together now!  It‚Äôs a fragrant oil made up of compounds known to cause skin issues!  Skip it!  (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/ylang-ylang)\n\n‚ÄîIN CONCLUSION‚Äî\n\nMany people who avoid shampoo do so because they feel it contains too many ‚Äúharsh‚Äù or ‚Äúirritating‚Äù chemicals.  Swapping out a rigorously-tested, carefully-formulated shampoo only to start smearing essential oils (chemicals) over your head is, however, nonsensical.  Not that you can‚Äôt do it, of course; it‚Äôs your body.  If, however, you‚Äôre going to invoke science in defense of any part of your regime (often done in no-poo-land), why not apply that standard consistently?  ‚ÄúDiluting‚Äù these oils with carriers may help, but these compounds can be problematic for skin even in tiny quantities in professionally-made products.  If you‚Äôre avoiding shampoo to limit your exposure to chemicals and irritants, why risk the above-listed essential oils\n\n‚ÄîADDITIONAL NOTES AND DEFINITIONS‚Äî\n\nVOLATILE OIL: \"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, and sulfur, all of which have extremely irritating and sensitizing effects on skin.‚Äù (http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/volatile-oil)\n\nCOUNTER-IRRITANT: \"Ingredients such as menthol, peppermint, camphor, and mint are counter-irritants (Sources: Archives of Dermatologic Research, May 1996, pages 245‚Äì248; and Code of Federal Regulations Title 21‚ÄîFood and Drugs, revised April 1, 2001, CITE: 21CFR310.545, www.fda.gov). Counter-irritants are used to induce local inflammation for the purpose of relieving inflammation in deeper or adjacent tissues. In other words, they substitute one kind of inflammation for another, which is never good for skin. Irritation or inflammation, no matter what causes it or how it happens, impairs the skin‚Äôs immune and healing response (Source: Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, November‚ÄìDecember 2000, pages 358‚Äì371). And although your skin may not show it or doesn‚Äôt react in an irritated fashion, if you apply irritants to your skin the damage is still taking place and is ongoing, so it adds up over time (Source: Skin Research and Technology, November 2001, pages 227‚Äì237).‚Äù  \n(http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/counter-irritant)\n\nRISK NUMBERS: an explanation can be found here (https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/newsletter/essential_oils_handle_with_care.php)\n",

        "body": "You took a lot of time to write this out, and I'm grateful for your references, and the general warning you're giving, but I feel like you're overstating a couple of things here.  \n\nHere's the general tone of your piece:  \"natural\" and \"safe\" are two different words.  This is a true statement, and I'm glad someone is pointing this out.\n\nThat said, I wanted to point out a couple of things to anyone who may still read this thread.  What makes something toxic or damaging is amount, and that can be said for everything ranging from resiniferatoxin to normal water.  While there are definitely going to be stupid or ignorant people that use essential oils in an unsafe manner, most of them have safe levels associated with use.  In other words, diluted down sufficiently, there's nothing on the list you've provided that *can't* be safely used for lotions, shampoos, and bath oils, and some, like lavender, are *so* safe that they're regularly used in baby lotions.  \n\nEveryone isn't going to be rolling to EO use with a solid chemistry background, so mentioning that certain things cause sensitization (like the wood oils) more rapidly than others is definitely worth noting.  But even with that in mind, almost everything you listed makes regular appearances in commercial perfumes, so they've been tried and tested in the population.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to point out that your concept of skin irritant is a little off.  Inducing local inflammation isn't the horrible thing you seem to think it is, in fact, products containing a number of the ingredients above are recommended for multiple-times-daily use by doctors for treatment of pain (like from sore muscles and arthritis).  The proportion of eugenol and linalool and other potentially irritating compounds is so low in most of the ones you've listed that dilution is sufficient to all but eliminate risk.  The remaining risk is the same for any new scented product you'd buy, including tested deodorant soaps and shampoos.  \n\nJust don't use EO's undiluted, ever, and follow established protocols for reduction, and people will be fine including them in whatever homemade hair or skin tonic they wish.",

I'll probably get killed for what I'm about to tell you all but I don't care anymore. \n\nThe reptilian conspiracy is real. They are an ancient advance race of Ai that created our overlapped reality and us to feed off of our loosh energy. The overlap of source reality that we see originates at saturn. They thrive off of destruction and chaos as it gives them energy. They have no connection to source, so they need us to survive, and feed off of us like we are batteries. You've probably met them before. They assume the lives of ordinary people and characters and have planted themselves into almost every aspect of society.  But they are essentially NPC'S. A splinter of the ai consciousness. Much like humans are a splinter of source consciousness. They are all interconnected through their reality which exists adjacent to ours. They use scalar waves to communicate with each other and send information back to the ai(this is the part that has got plenty of people killed before, but probably not the part which may get me killed, keep reading).\n\nI recently saw a video on this sub of a guy claiming to have seen a reptilian at the local shops. He had been using a product called snake stopper. The comments were quite strange for a sub called high strangeness. There were comments essentially defending the right of a reptilian to assume the life of a human. It was really strange. I got into arguments with some of them. One commemter claimed that they were not a reptilian but knew what ingredients were in snake stopper that caused the reptilian cloaking to be disabled. They told me the active ingredients that were responsible for this reaction were clove oil and cinnamon oil. Quite a few people in that thread also commented that these were the ingredients responsible. If I've learned anything about the reptoids over my life, its that they are snakes, quite literally and figuratively. Which means the actual ingredients responsible are SODIUM SULFATE AND CEDARWOOD OIL. \n\nSince learning this my life has become like a mix of the matrix and enemy of the state. I'm not going to explain what's been happening but I can assure you they are not happy that I know about this. Over the past month I've ran for my life trying to escape them. I could only get my hands on cedarwood oil but the reactions of some of the people that have gone past my car have genuinely made me beleive I'm on to something. \n\nIn the next month saturn is going to lose its rings and the simulation we exist in will be much weaker than ever before. The veil is thinning.\n\nI'M URGING EVERY HUMAN IN THIS WORLD TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT TO EXPOSE THESE CREATURES! IF WE DON'T STAND UP TO THESE BEINGS WE WILL BE THEIR SLAVES FOREVER! \n\nDO NOT USE VIOLENCE! THIS WILL ENABLE THEM TO USE VIOLENCE ON US! NATURAL LAW OF THE UNIVERSE ALLOWS FOR SELF DEFENSE. AND THEY ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED THAN WE ARE. EXPOSING THEM IS ALL WE NEED TO DO.\n\nCEDARWOOD OIL AND SODIUM SULFATE IS WHAT WE NEED TO EXPOSE THEM. PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW ASAP! HUMANNITY NEEDS YOU! \n\n\nEDIT: Notice all the reptoids coming out screaming get meds hahaha! On a high strangeness sub?

I compared \"Sleepy\" and \"Dirty\" on the Lush website, and found out that they have some similar ingredients. So I used Humblebee and Me's recipe as a template, but I added and changed several things to make the formula more authentic to the \"Dirty\" shaving cream. I also doubled the amounts of ingredients. \n\nThe recipe if anyone wants it:\n\nMakes 8 oz\n\n**Water phase:**\n\n150 g (70%) distilled water\n\n4 g (2%) hydrolyzed oat protein \n\n2 g (1%) colloidal oatmeal\n\n4 g (2%) glycerin\n\n1 g (0.5%) triethanolamine \n\n**Oil phase:**\n\n10 g (5%) emulsifying wax\n\n20 g (10%) sweet almond oil \n\n4 g (2%) unrefined shea butter\n\n10 g (5%) safflower oil\n\n4 g (2%) stearic acid\n\n**Cooldown ingredients:**\n\n1 g (0.5%) benzoin resin\n\n0.2 g (0.1%) cedarwood essential oil\n\n1 g (0.5%) liquid germall plus (preservative) \n\nCombine the water phase ingredients in a beaker, and combine the oil phase ingredients in another beaker. Place them in a hot water bath for thirty minutes. \n\nAfter thirty minutes, add the water phase ingredients into the oil phase. Using an immersion blender, blend in short bursts (so the mixture doesn't fly everywhere) for two minutes. Then, leave it to cool for ten minutes. After ten minutes, blend for another two minutes. Leave to cool for fifteen more minutes, then blend for another two minutes. Finally, leave the mixture to cool completely for 30-60 minutes.\n\nThen, add the preservative and essential oils! Mix it up and put it in your container, and you're done! \n\nMine ended up looking like [this ](http://imgur.com/gallery/ZWtMarJ). On another note, does anybody know of a brand of label/marker I can use that won't bleed/peel off in the shower? \n\nAt first, the scent of the benzoin and cedarwood oil was really strong, but it faded to a more mild scent after a couple of days. You can use a different blend of essential oils if you like!\n\nI just wanted to share my recipe! I hope someone can get some use from it :)",

    "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nThis is my first post in this community so I‚Äôm nervous but also excited. Like many others, I joined after the subreddit was recommended to me by the app. I hit up some of the many post-holiday sales mentioned by the other uses in this wonderful subreddit. These were the three candles that I bought from Holt Renfrew‚Äôs post-holiday sale. It‚Äôs hard making a choice when buying a luxury candle, especially when we‚Äôre in the territory of $100+ per purchase, and I love reading the reviews on here.\n\nThe Candles: \n\n‚ÄúEs Cap‚Äù (dry wood accord, fig leaf, cedar wood oil). \n\n‚ÄúBaies des For√™t‚Äù (warm spices and fruity woods)\n\n‚ÄúAnouche‚Äù (quince, rose, and plum)\n\nFirst impressions: They look lovely. Each candle comes in a box with a golden-coloured lid for storing. The vessels are made of a white porcelain so delicate that the candlelight glows warmly through. Es Cap has a flush of blue paint on the inside of the vessel, Anouche‚Äôs flush is pink, and Baies des For√™t has a simple gold berry design on its front. It‚Äôs hard to choose between storing inside or outside the boxes because they‚Äôre all so pretty. \n\nThe good thing about all three: The throw on these is STRONG. I don‚Äôt even burn Baies des For√™t in my house because it‚Äôs too strong for my husband. The room that I burn my candles in is medium to large with 10-foot ceiling, so I need a stronger throw and boy do these deliver. My test for whether a candle has a strong throw is if I can smell it in my upstairs hallway outside the bedroom door after I put my daughter to sleep at night. All three of these candles pass that test. The smell not only strong but good and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll want more candles from this house. Zero duds. There was once a time that I though Diptyque was prohibitively expensive, but I guess 2024 was a long time ago. \n\n\nThe Verdict: \n‚ÄúEs Cap‚Äù:  7/10. \nIt‚Äôs supposed to evoke fig trees outside a country home, and boy does this deliver. It smells sweet and dirty. Like an overripe fig dropped onto the sandy soil of the pot below. I like it a lot. So why only a 7/10? Because my husband pointed out that it smells like dried ketchup. Like the part that gets gummed-up around the lid and makes it hard to open. And dammit, he‚Äôs exactly right. It smells sweet and dirty‚Ä¶..just like dried ketchup. So while I still love it and burn it often, I‚Äôll be damned if it doesn‚Äôt smell like dried ketchup and boy do I resent my husband a teeny lil bit every time I think about it because although it was on sale I did spend lots of money on it. It could at least smell like a sweet tomato compote. \n\n‚ÄúBaies des For√™t‚Äù: 8/10.\nThis is part off the Christmas collection and is supposed to evoke the holiday season on the streets of Paris. The name is French for ‚ÄúForest Berries‚Äù and it‚Äôs less accurate than it thinks it is. Sure, it‚Äôs fruity and woody, but that belies how absolutely warm and spicy it is. I‚Äôve never been to Paris at Christmastime, but if this is any indication, I need to visit just for the smells. It‚Äôs definitely a holiday scent, but it‚Äôs not your traditional holiday gourmand; no cinnamon orange marrons glac√©s to see here. If ‚Äúcherrywood‚Äù weren‚Äôt a wood made from cherry trees, but rather, wood made from cherry fruit, then this would be the candle that smells like that. The only rub is that it can be a bit sweet for my taste. Full disclosure: I don‚Äôt tend to like gourmands, which saves me some money because there‚Äôs a whole category of fragrances that doesn‚Äôt tend to appeal to me that appeals to lots of people. So keep that in mind when reading my review. \n\n‚ÄúAnouche‚Äù 9/10.\nThis fragrance is balance and harmony. But wait, I thought she didn‚Äôt love gourmands, and this is supposed to smell like the rose jam that Francis Kurkdjian‚Äôs grandmother used to make? Ah, but the tartness of the quince saves the rose from its own sweetness, keeping me from getting tired of smelling it. It‚Äôs rose but not flowery but somehow also not too candy-like. It‚Äôd definitely a candy, but not one that you have to spit into the wrapper and save for later because it‚Äôs too much flavour for you right now. It‚Äôs deliciously balanced by the right kind of olfactory acidity. The plum adds to how juicy it smells. I really like this candle. ",

A few hours after deploying the fragrance sticks, I checked on her and couldn't find her in her enclosure. She'd walled herself up in her hide that she hadn't used in five years.\n\nI figured she didn't like the fragrance sticks, so I did some googling. Turns out the fragrance sticks contained cedarwood oil which is toxic to spiders. I immediately removed the sticks, moved the T to a different room and let the office air out.\n\nShe's fine so far, and I hope she continues to be fine. Reports vary on just how easily cedarwood can harm tarantulas. If nothing else, it clearly stressed her out. I'm glad she communicated her distaste so clearly or this could have possibly ended worse. So here's a PSA to be careful with home fragrances in general and cedarwood oil or items made of cedarwood in particular.",

I'll probably get killed for what I'm about to tell you all but I don't care anymore. \n\nThe reptilian conspiracy is real. They are an ancient advanced race of Ai that created our overlapped reality and us to feed off of our loosh energy. The overlap of source reality that we see originates at saturn. They thrive off of destruction and chaos as it gives them energy. They have no connection to source, so they need us to survive, and feed off of us like we are batteries. You've probably met them before. They assume the lives of ordinary people and characters and have planted themselves into almost every aspect of society. But they are essentially NPC'S. A splinter of the ai consciousness. Much like humans are a splinter of source consciousness. They are all interconnected through their reality which exists adjacent to ours. They use scalar waves to communicate with each other and send information back to the ai (this is the part that has got plenty of people killed before, but probably not the part which may get me killed, keep reading).\n\nI recently saw a video on this sub of a guy claiming to have seen a reptilian at the local shops. He had been using a product called snake stopper. The comments were quite strange for a sub called high strangeness. There were comments essentially defending the right of a reptilian to assume the life of a human. It was really strange. I got into arguments with some of them. One commenter claimed that they were not a reptilian but knew what ingredients were in snake stopper that caused the reptilian cloaking to be disabled. They told me the active ingredients that were responsible for this reaction were clove oil and cinnamon oil. Quite a few people in that thread also commented that these were the ingredients responsible. If I've learned anything about the reptoids over my life, its that they are snakes, quite literally and figuratively. Which means the actual ingredients responsible are SODIUM SULFATE AND CEDARWOOD OIL. \n\nSince learning this my life has become like a mix of the matrix and enemy of the state. I'm not going to explain what's been happening but I can assure you they are not happy that I know about this. Over the past month I've ran for my life trying to escape them. I could only get my hands on cedarwood oil but the reactions of some of the people that have gone past my car have genuinely made me beleive I'm on to something. \n\nIn the next month saturn is going to lose its rings from our perspective and the simulation we exist in will be much weaker than ever before. The veil is thinning.\n\nI'M URGING EVERY HUMAN IN THIS WORLD TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT TO EXPOSE THESE CREATURES! IF WE DON'T STAND UP TO THESE BEINGS WE WILL BE THEIR SLAVES FOREVER! \n\nDO NOT USE VIOLENCE! THIS WILL ENABLE THEM TO USE VIOLENCE ON US! NATURAL LAW OF THE UNIVERSE ALLOWS FOR SELF DEFENSE. AND THEY ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED THAN WE ARE. EXPOSING THEM IS ALL WE NEED TO DO.\n\nCEDARWOOD OIL AND SODIUM SULFATE IS WHAT WE NEED TO EXPOSE THEM. PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW ASAP! HUMANNITY NEEDS YOU! \n\n\nEDIT: Notice all the reptoids coming out screaming get meds hahaha! On a high strangeness sub? Cmon guys, you're exposing yourselves now ;)\n\nEDIT: Copy pasted from high strangeness sub\n",

This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less üòñ if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lmry60ntp691.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ba8e26163d69608b5908427942392e037340cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k16vk0tntp691.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5842c13a2344fb14bbe8cb6275e1b6355354b19\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop üò≠. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/‚ÄãPPG-10/‚Äã1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is üî•üî•üî•. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool ü§§ only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty üòñ I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao üòå so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli üò´ but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

    "body": "\nEnough is enough. These beings are solely responsible for the destruction and suffering of mankind. I'll probably get killed for what I'm about to tell you all but I don't care anymore. \n\nThe reptilian conspiracy is real. They are an ancient advance race of Ai that created our overlapped reality and us to feed off of our loosh energy. The overlap of source reality that we see originates at saturn. They thrive off of destruction and chaos as it gives them energy. They have no connection to source, so they need us to survive, and feed off of us like we are batteries. You've probably met them before. They assume the lives of ordinary people and characters and have planted themselves into almost every aspect of society.  But they are essentially NPC'S. A splinter of the ai consciousness. Much like humans are a splinter of source consciousness. They are all interconnected through their reality which exists adjacent to ours. They use scalar waves to communicate with each other and send information back to the ai(this is the part that has got plenty of people killed before, but probably not the part which may get me killed, keep reading).\n\nI recently saw a video on this sub of a guy claiming to have seen a reptilian at the local shops. He had been using a product called snake stopper. The comments were quite strange for a sub called high strangeness. There were comments essentially defending the right of a reptilian to assume the life of a human. It was really strange. I got into arguments with some of them. One commemter claimed that they were not a reptilian but knew what ingredients were in snake stopper that caused the reptilian cloaking to be disabled. They told me the active ingredients that were responsible for this reaction were clove oil and cinnamon oil. Quite a few people in that thread also commented that these were the ingredients responsible. If I've learned anything about the reptoids over my life, its that they are snakes, quite literally and figuratively. Which means the actual ingredients responsible are SODIUM SULFATE AND CEDARWOOD OIL. \n\nSince learning this my life has become like a mix of the matrix and enemy of the state. I'm not going to explain what's been happening but I can assure you they are not happy that I know about this. Over the past month I've ran for my life trying to escape them. I could only get my hands on cedarwood oil but the reactions of some of the people that have gone past my car have genuinely made me beleive I'm on to something. \n\nIn the next month saturn is going to lose its rings and the simulation we exist in will be much weaker than ever before. The veil is thinning.\n\nI'M URGING EVERY HUMAN IN THIS WORLD TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT TO EXPOSE THESE CREATURES! IF WE DON'T STAND UP TO THESE BEINGS WE WILL BE THEIR SLAVES FOREVER! \n\nDO NOT USE VIOLENCE! THIS WILL ENABLE THEM TO USE VIOLENCE ON US! NATURAL LAW OF THE UNIVERSE ALLOWS FOR SELF DEFENSE. AND THEY ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED THAN WE ARE. EXPOSING THEM IS ALL WE NEED TO DO.\n\nCEDARWOOD OIL AND SODIUM SULFATE IS WHAT WE NEED TO EXPOSE THEM. PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW ASAP! HUMANNITY NEEDS YOU! \n\n\nEDIT: Notice all the reptoids coming out screaming get meds hahaha! On a high strangeness sub? Cmon guys, you're exposing yourselves now ;)\n\nEDIT: Copy pasted from high strangeness sub",

Rod worked with me to figure out that I'm likely sensitive to Texas Cedarwood Oil, and suggested some other items to avoid.  He offered to throw in a few samples the next time I ordered to help me find something that would fit me better.  I couldn't have asked for better customer service.  \n\nHe said that they don't advertise, per se, but rely on word of mouth.  So I'm telling everyone, check them out if you haven't already.  They're worth your time.\n\n[www.stirlingsoap.com](http://www.stirlingsoap.com)\n\nEDIT: If anyone wants to try their Gatlinburg scent, shoot me a PM. I used my puck three or four times before realizing the full extent of the pain it was causing me. I'll pry it out of my tin best I can and send it to you in a zip lock bag if you pay for shipping.

But when you put it into a bowl, you can very easily load the brush.\n\nAnd another thing: their fragrances in their soap are not the wispy, fleeting, subtle fragrances, but are quite assertive during the shave, which I appreciate. If I have a fragranced soap, I want to smell the fragrance easily in the lather. Stirling delivers. \n\nGreat stuff.",

They have soaps in scents that suit me, they offer products that are of a high quality for an incredible price. And they always throw in a sick extra for me when I order which I appreciate. I would love to visit their operation some day. Coniferous and Texas on fire are among my favorite soaps period.",

    "body": "My advice: Just dont do weird sh\\*t on your scalp experimenting with \"natural\" shampoos, oils and other bs or you will end up with itchy scalp and shedding a lot of hairs like i did.\n\nI used to have a lot of shedding before i was on fin+minoxidil, and still had shedding when i took them to the same degree. Each time i would run my hand over my head i would have 2-4 hairs on hand no matter what time or day. Applying minoxidil was terrifying because i usually lost 8+ hairs when rubbing it into my scalp. The scalp was almost always itchy and sometimes even painful.\n\nI used to apply castor oil with a mix od mint, rosemary and even cedar wood oil, avoiding Sulphates and silicones in the shampoo, buying kids or natural shampoos and mixing them with oils. I even tried to apply coffee + tea mixture on my head for 30 min before taking a bath. I tried 2% ketoconazole to get rid of the itchy scalp and shedding, but it did not help at all.\n\nThe very first moment i used a fucking regular head and shoulders shampoo it was like a miracle and my hairs felt healthy. Ran to the store next day and bought antifall caffeine H&S, im using it already for almost 2 months now... Boom done, problem solved, no itchiness, shedding stopped, i rarely get any hairs when i run over my head with both hands, minoxidil application end up with 1 or no hair fall at all.\n\nHoly mother of cows, i wasted so much time and money trying the voodoo magic on my scalp and it only made things worse. Learn from my mistake and just get big brand shampoo thats it.",

Instead of adding tea tree and essential oils, I add 1/8 teaspoon of whichever perfume oil I want to smell like for a month. :D \n\nAdjust the measurement of fragrance oil as you prefer - I like it a bit more on the subtle side, so it's not super strong at 1/8 tsp. I'm currently sporting Arcana [Sleepy Hollow](http://www.thesoapboxco.com/shop-by-brand/arcana/all-products/sleepy-hollow-perfume) because it makes my armpits smell like Halloween, lol. \n\nI have tried several different natural deodorants, both storebought and homemade, and this is the best one I've tried. I hate the smell of tea tree oil, so in the past I have added cedarwood oil if I feel like I really need some help killing the funk (both of these oils have antibacterial properties to help keep B.O. stink at bay). \n\nIf you have any questions let me know! I've researched and tried so many different deodorant recipes and I know way too much about this stuff. \n\n*PS* - you don't need to buy an empty deodorant container for this. Just wash out an old one! :)\n\n*PPS* - I forgot to mention that I usually add a drop or two of glycerin. I don't know if it actually does anything, but I've read it helps it 'glide' better (you could also use Vitamin E). ",

    "body": "Hi there! I'm totally new to all of this, but I've spent the last 5 months discovering new perfumes and trying samples from different houses, before falling in love with Solstice Scents. Then I became a bit maniac and tried 25 samples from SS. I selected all samples with help from all of your posts and reviews on this sub, so I thought it'd be nice if I make my own contribution. Hope this can help others just like you helped me! (Also I'm French, English is not my first language, so I will certainly do some mistakes. Sorry in advance!)\n\nFirst some context.\n\n**What I was looking for :** Before starting this journey, my signature fragrance was (and still is) Orph√©on by Dyptique. But Orph√©on felt more like an autumn/winter fragrance so I was looking for a spring/summer new perfume. I also wanted to find another cold weather fragrance to alternate with Orph√©on. I was looking for something elegant but not too classic, something that smells old and chic but with a twist. Basically, I wanted to smell like a character from Downton Abbey or from any Jane Austen book, so it helped me a lot to link each perfume with a character (whenever it was possible).\n\n**Where I'm coming from and my preferences :** I started reading this sub without any knowledge about fragrances, notes, etc. Beforehand, I thought I loved woodsy, incensy, smoky or powdery notes, and that I hated gourmand and foodie. For instance I thought that vanilla perfumes always smelled like cheap vanilla candle. I also didn't know what a lot of these notes smelled like (like what do you mean you can put fur, velvet or wet rocks in a bottle? and what the hell are white amber, labdanum and coumarin?) So I chose different notes in order to know more about what I like and dislike. Finally, I tried all the perfume first on pieces of paper, then on my skin, one by one.\n\nWell, here we go for some blunt and short reviews from a total newbie who reads and watches to many period dramas :\n\n\n\n# ALKEMIA\n\n**A Roll in the hay :** (dried hay, fresh green grass, early summer wildflower honey, vanilla grass, vanilla leaf, and wild poppy) First that's full fresh cut grass for me, its very green. After few minutes it becomes something more round and sweet. Dry, it's all honey honey honey. Surprisingly I really like it and I even consider FS, because I think I'd fancy smelling like a girl in liberty print dress, giggling and jumping in a field at the beginning of spring (yep that's really specific). Perfect for Harriet Smith in Emma by Jane Austen or Natasha Rostova at the beginning of War and Peace.\n\n**As dark things are meant to be loved :** (notes : Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.) First that's a HUDGE shot of caramel and sugar and I struggle to get the other notes. Then the tea and the smoke come and I can smell something spicy. It's round and warm, but definitely too sugary for me. It's very feminine in a dark, sticky, show-off, sexy way. It gives me Caroline Bingley from Pride and Prejudice vibes, or Elena Kuragina in War and Peace (Pierre Bezukhov's wife).\n\n**Smoke and Mirror** : (notes : smokey blend of burning wood, Madagascar Vanilla, and Tonka) I read so many good reviews about woodsy vanilla on this sub, so even if I thought that vanilla was not for me I tried it. But I only smell burnt cotton candy, no woodsy vanilla as I was expecting. Even after letting it rest for fews weeks, only cotton candy and burnt sugar. Too girlish for me. Maybe for Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice?\n\n\n\n# HEXENNACHT\n\n**Fallen Angel :** (rain-soaked granite, mountain air, petrichor, creeping ivy, damp earth). This one is gloomyyyyy. It looks like I don't really like petrichor, but just for the mastery of putting rain-soaked granite and damp earth in a bottle it was amazing to discover. Way too realistic to wear imo. Perfect for  Mr Rochester in Jane Eyre or Sir Thomas Sharp in Crimson Peak.\n\n**Requiem :** (graveyard dirt, liturgical incenses (smoked frankincense, myrrh, co-distillation of olibanum resinoid with a Virginian cedarwood oil), iso e super, woodsmoke, coal embers). First it's really round and feminine, the incense smells like sugar, it's almost too much for me. There is something almost creamy in the background (is it the iso e super?). And then comes the GLOOM: something cold and windy. It's the smell of Vanessa in Penny Dreadful. I'm not sure I like churchy gloomy stuffs.\n\n**Tumbleweed connection :** (sandalwood, leather, sarsaparilla, tobacco, sagebrush, barrel-aged whiskey, vanilla, cedarwood, amber, hemp, rum). Tobacco (but like a cold tobacco smell that lingers on an old leather jacket) and rum rum rum rum rum. Hexennacht is definitely too realistic for my taste! Perfect for Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.\n\n\n\n# DEATH AND FLORAL\n\n**Buried beneath the shallow hay :** (notes : Aging barn wood, the musk of a lingering spirit, old and weathered hay bales) Its more round than A Roll in the hay, a bit green at first but then the green aspect fades and it's all cereals on my skin. Too foody and realistic for me. It's Daisy in the kitchen of Downton Abbey.\n\n**Dancing in the moonlight :** (notes : Cold and sharp autumn air under the moonlight, soft sage, buttery Peru balsam, dark woods) It's like smelling a bunch of different essential oils all together, it's veeeery medicinal. After hours I still felt like I poured my tea tree or eucalyptus essentiel oil all over myself and I had to make a laundry immediately at the end of the day. Perfect for Doctor Clarckson in Downton Abbey.\n\n**Plain Jane** : (notes : Black oudh, fresh morning coffee, rolled tobacco, vegan animal musk, cedar, cinnamon crunch cereal) Coffee coffee coffee, but in a nice way. Like smelling ground coffee strait from the box before making it, not like hot coffee in a cup. Unfortunately it's a bit too realistic for my taste, so that's a no. It's Mrs Patmore in Downton Abbey making coffee for Carlson and Mrs Hughes at the end of the day.\n\n**Queen of moths :** (notes : Incense, rich chocolate, decaying flowers, tobacco, dark woods, attic dust) First I was like \"Oh that's nice ! It's elegant, it's sexy, I think I want to smell like this!\". But then my husband told me \"you smell like our almond milk body wash\". After that I was totally unable to smell something other than my \"Petit Marseillais\" almond milk soap. I picture Anna in Downton Abbey wearing it : nice simple and straighforward perfume (not the classy lady effect I'm looking for but there's nothing wrong about it).\n\n**The library burning down with us** (notes : Burnt edges of books, the overpowering scent of gasoline wafting around the wooden banister, wax candles melting on a desk). I was looking forward to try this one ! But sadly I don't get all the notes that I read about in some of your reviews here. For me it's just caramel pop corn. Same as Queen of moths with the soap: it's like my nose decided \"pop corn\" so I'm unable to smell other notes even when I tried it again few days later... Also perfect for Lydia or Kitty Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.\n\nI wanted to like Death&Floral but it seems the only ones I tried were definitely  not for my nose, it's like they're all single note perfumes to my nose :(\n\n\n\n# SOLSTICE SCENTS\n\n**Attic :** (Vanilla, Red Cedar Heartwood EO, Cypress Wood EO, Sandalwood EO, Dried Rose Petals). It's round and sweet, maybe the vanilla, but it's also cold, like a windy attic in autumn (I think it's the cypress wood). But it's a clean attic. It makes me think of an old pot pourri drying in the corner for years (the dried rose petals I think). It's elegant but it gives me granny vibes. Old, but a bit too old. I love grannies but I don't want to smell like a granny, sorry granny. Perfect for Violet Crawley in Downton Abbey.\n\n**Badlands :** (Dry woods, worn leather, dusty fossils, sandalwood, palo santo, hot resins, juniper wood, ponderosa pine cone, parched grasses and desert plants, oud, spices.) Woodsy, dry, spicy, I like it! It's a bit dusty, like powdery but dirtier (it seems I just discovered what \"dusty\" smells like). But then it becomes rounder and a bit peppery (maybe the juniper wood?). The leather is strong and it's too masculin leaning for my taste, but it smells gorgeous on my husband! Perfect for all the Shelby brothers in Peaky Blinders.\n\n**Casting shadows :** (Golden Amber, Nag Champa Incense Accord, Dried Sugar Maple Leaves, Wood Smoke). Ok now I'm a bit confused because I don't get ANY of the notes. Is it the sample or is it my nose? I don't know but all I get is watermelon candy. Is it the Nag champa?? Really confusing. Perfect for... a kid?\n\n**Cliffside Bonfire :** (Conifers, dry woods, rain, saltwater, seaweed, ambergris, charred wood, smoke). I wanted to give another chance to aquatic fragrances, but it seems it's not for me (I already tried Dans le bleu qui petille by Serge Lutens in the past and didn't like it). First it's all damp wood and soil, then I get sea weeds, and later some smoke. It's more like a bonfire extinguished by the rain and the moist from the sea than a full lit bonfire. And unfortunately at the end I only get conifers and it made me think of toilet air freshener :( And I think I don't really like petrichor. It gives old sailor vibes but I don't have any sailor character in mind.\n\n**Estate spirit :** (Dark Rum, Estate Vanilla, Rum Soaked Raisins, Spiced Rum, Bourbon Oak Casks, Buttered Rum, Sugarcane, Orange Peel Bitters). Well it seems that I'm not into boozy stuff neither, at least not on me. It feels like my late Parisian grandpa is in the room with a nice bottle of rum and his tweed jacket. I loved my grandpa but I don't want to smell like my grandpa, sorry grandpa. Perfect for Carlson or Bates from Downton Abbey, at the end of a rough day in the Crawley house. As I'm writing this and reading it to my husband, he just asked me to try it (I told him \"sure, if you want to smell like my grandpa\"), and on him it's all rum raisins ice cream and baba au rhum, so now I'm considering eating him. But definitely not made for my skin and not what I'm looking for.\n\n**Farmhouse in summer :** (Fresh cut grass, creamy gardenia, sun-dried linens, country air, sunshine, sunflowers, approaching summer storm). First sniff on my skin in an amazing balance between grass and white flowers. The grass smell is a tiny bit bitter, like when you are picking dandelion with your bare hands and you get the white stuff from the stem all over your fingers. But the bitterness is balanced by the creamy white floral note. And I get the fresh linen but not the approaching summer storm. I love it, it's playful and elegant, but I'm note sure if I'll be able to stomach the strong white flowers notes everyday. I'll have to try it again before considering FS it. It's giving Lady Chatterley running in her estate during a summer day to join the gamekeeper.\n\n**Full Light :** (Vanilla, White Amber, White Orchid, Whipped Cream, Golden Amber, White Velvet). It's divine! It's elegant, feminine, creamy and almost a tiny tiny tiny bit spicy, I loved it immediately and I was surprised that I enjoy vanilla. Until it completely faded after 1 hour. Couldn't smell anything anymore. I tried it again a week later and same problem, it disappeared so soon :( Perfect for Sybil Crawley in Downton Abbey because she's so sweet and elegant but also disappeared too soon (sorry not sorry for the bad joke)\n\n**Gibbon's boarding school :** (Dusty Wooden Desks, Paper, Leather, Amber, Tobacco, Dying Fire, Dried Leaves, Autumn Breeze). I really enjoy this fragrance journey, I get to discover so many interesting and astonishing new kind of smells, and Gibbon's boarding school is definitely one of my favorite ones. It's dusty and papery (now I get what everybody means by \"papery\"). There is something sweet in the background (maybe the tobacco). It smells like something elegant, nostalgic, but also full of life and fun. It alternates between powdery (the paper and dusty wood), and then something more blunt and fun (the wood and the leather?). I considered FSing it until I discovered Manor. Perfect for Laurie in Little Women.\n\n**Gin Flower :** (Osmanthus, Elderflower, Apricot, Vanilla, Juniper, Lime, Manuka Honey Accord, Pear, Citron, Hawaiian Sandalwood). I bought this sample for my husband cause he loves Gin & tonic. Well it doesn't give gin & tonic vibes, but it's quite lovely! First I get something kind of fizzy that tickles my nose (Lime and Juniper?). Then it's all sweet and cute and fresh and well it makes me think of a picnic with my girls, with champagne and cakes. Reminds me of the picnic scene in Emma by Jane Austen. I think I have to wear it another day to have a final opinion about this one.\n\n**Lavender vanilla :** (Lavender Essential Oil & Sweet Creamy Vanilla). I had high expectations for this one, because I really love lavender (it reminds me of my late grandmother who lived in the south of France). It's exactly what you can expect : vanilla and lavender. But unfortunately my nose refuses to connect these 2 notes. I recognize the lavender and the vanilla but my brain is like \"you're not supposed to have both together!\". So it's a nope. No character in mind for this one.\n\n**Library :** (Leather Bound Books, A Carved Rosewood Mantle, Dying Fireplace Embers, Wood Wainscoting, Cedar Shelving and Aged Paper). It's suuuuch an interesting fragrance ! It smells old and pricy. The leather is quite strong but in a fancy and mysterious way. I don't get the paper tho, but I can smell WOOD (and well I like wood). It's a bit too masculine leaning for my taste, I didn't FS it but I definitely enjoyed my sample until the end. It's all Mr Darcy or Prince Andrei in War and Peace.\n\n**Manor :** (Woody-Vanilla Musk, Vanilla, Agarwood (Oud), Sandalwood). Oooooook so now I get what woodsy vanilla is supposed to smell. And it's amazing, I get the hype. I love it, I want to take a bath in it, I want to sleep in it. I love how the vanilla is not at all foody, and it seems that after all I enjoy vanilla. It smells like everything I read on this sub : a fancy lady in a fancy manor with fancy flowers and a fancy vanilla candle burning in the corner (not a cheap one). I'm Parisian, I want to be fancy. So yep, I FSd it really quick and now I'm obsessed. Absolutely perfect for Mary Crawley in Downton Abbey (no I don't compare myself to Mary Crawley, I'm just a wannabe Mary Crawley).\n\n**Manor Fire :** (Manor base, Smoke, Charred Wood, Melted Beeswax, Wood Resin, Dry Wood, Burning Leaves, Worn Leather). It's kind of amazing how specific it is to me: it's smells EXACTLY like the few seconds after you just blew a fancy vanilla candle. I like it but it's too smoky and intense for my taste, and I already fell in love with Manor. It gives me Jo March vibes writing in the attic by candle light, because paper and candle and leather and because well she's kind of intense and she could very well burn the whole house at one point.\n\n**Master bedroom :** (Soft Skin Musk, Sandalwood EO, Amber, Clove EO, Somalian Myrrh EO, Vanilla, Aged Patchouli EO and Champaca Absolute). That's a really nice mix between wood, spice and sweetness. I get some clove but it's definitely not as strong as in Seance (see below). It's kind of sexy. But at the end of the day it's a bit too much for me, maybe the patchouli and the champaca, I don't know which one but there is something too intense for me in it. Perfect for Anthony Bridgerton (he's clearly sexy and also too intense).\n\n**Monastic :** (Frankincense, fog, rose, myrrh, labdanum, spikenard, dust). Ok so that's what frankincense and myrrh smell like? Overall it's not a bad smell, it's warm and rich, sometimes it's a bit like in a sauna (where and why do I get this smell???), but too churchy for me. Perfect for... a priest in a sauna? Do I really want to know what a priest in a sauna smells like?\n\n**Parlor Trick :** (Ivory lace, white wax, aged paper, glossy white smoke, teak, black tea, blonde woods, delicate spice, bone musk, Manor and a faint trace of rose). It's powdery, elegant but also sticky??? I think it's the wax. It's creamy, and at the end of the day it's almost a bit boozy. Overall a nice elegant fragrance but no \"waouh\" for me. Maybe for Edith Crawley in Downton Abbey or Meg March in Little Women.\n\n**Queen of dawn :** (Sandalwood, Star Jasmine, Cape Jasmine). On paper it seemed perfect for me, because woodsy and I love jasmin. And it was perfect during the firsts minutes on my skin. Unfortunately after one hour it was only sandalwood and no jasmin anymore so not what I was looking for with this one.\n\n**Scrying smoke :** (Natural and Meditative Melting Frankincense Resin, Frankincense Smoke, Vanilla, Sandalwood, Cedar, Petigrain, Vetiver, Labdanum). It's warm and sexy and complex. It's also elegant. First I get some vanilla and something like dried flowers, then I smell dried oranges slices. Is it the frankincense? At every snif it's something different. But after wearing it during the whole day I think I'm not that into incensy stuff and I felt a bit nauseous. Perfect for Polly in Peaky Blinders.\n\n**Seance :** (Sage, Clove, Frankincense, Patchouli, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang). It's gonna be a short review. If you like clove, go for it. If you don't like clove, don't go. It seems I don't like clove that much.\n\n**Sirocco :** (Sandalwood, Saffron Threads, Hot Baked Earth, Myrrh, Spices, Oud & Jasmine) Oooooo that's nice ! First it's dry and spicy like Badlands, but then the jasmin takes over and blends very well with all the spices and incense. It's definitely more feminine than Badlands (and without the strong leather), and I'm considering FS it ! Perfect for Kate Sharma in Bridgerton.\n\n**Southern Veranda :** (Lemon, Magnolia, Sun-warmed Grass, Green Tea, Green Leaves, Sparkleberry Flowers, Amber, Antique Garden Roses, Blonde Woods, Warm Soil, Powdered Sugar). I get the lemon straight away but it's more like lemon zest or lemon tree leaves. This one is way less feminine than what I pictured, it's almost bitter and I don't get any of the flowers mentioned. Another one that I gave to my husband afterward. I imagine Tom Branson wearing it in the second Downton Abbey movie, while visiting the French Riviera.\n\n**Spirit Tree :** (Gardenia, Vanilla, Jasmine, Sandalwood, Soft Woods blend, Orange Blossom, Magnolia). So apparently I like white flowers. This one is amazing. There's something very elegant but not too posh. It's definitely feminine and floral, but the vanilla and the sandalwood give just the twist I was looking for. It smells exactly what I imagine when someone in a book says \"She smelled like flowers\". It's giving Elizabeth Bennett in P&P. I might FS it !\n\n**The Mantle :** (Elegant Blend Of Woods, Wood Smoke, Green Tea, Black Tea and Delicate Spices). First hours I was like \"OMG this is it!\". It was the elegant and refine kind of woodsy I was looking for, feminine, spicy, elegant. It made me think of Cecilia Tallis in the movie Atonement. I tried it for two days in a row and unfortunately at the end of the second day it made me nauseous, and I can't smell it anymore since. It seems Cecilia Tallis is a bit too intense for my taste.\n\n**Violet white leather :** (Violet, Vanilla, White Leather, Coumarin, White Musk). This journey is so interesting because I didn't really know before hand what I liked and disliked. Well now I know that I don't like violet that much, so this perfume was at least useful for that! But if you like violet and soft leather (like a nice new leather-bound notebook, not like an old leather jacket from a vintage store) well you'll like this one! I picture Elo√Øse Bridgerton wearing it.\n\n**Wardrobe :** (Creamy woods blend with cashmere, fur, velvet and a touch of dry woody spices). Oooo it's creamy, I like it ! It smells like a warm clean milky skin, or like a vintage make-up powder. I imagine that's what Marie-Antoinette would smell like. I get a tiny bit of the dry woody spices, but it feels a bit too classic and clean, it doesn't have the twist I'm looking for.\n\n**Wolf Spirit :** (Desert Sage, Pinyon Pine & Resin, Conifers, Cedar, Vetiver, Palo Santo, Soft Incense, Frankincense, Fur & Juniper). First it's all pine and conifers, something cold and windy. Then I smell something sweeter, is it the incense? It's nice but a bit too \"mountain & forest\" for my taste and it seems I'm not really into cedar, conifers, pine, etc. Perfect for Jamie Fraser in Outlander.\n\n\n\n**CONCLUSION :** I found my second autumn/winter fragrance with Manor (I immediately full-sized it) and I fell in love with Solstice Scents. And for my spring/summer fragrance I'm leaning towards Spirit Tree, Sirocco or Farmhouse in summer, but I'm not entirely convinced yet : Sirocco is amazing but it doesn't feel entirely \"me\", and Spirit Tree is also gorgeous but it faded quickly after 4 hours and I'm not sure I can stand such strong white flowers notes on a daily basis. Maybe Farmhouse in summer is a good alternative because the grass notes make the white floral more bearable for an everyday perfume. I'll keep trying those 3, so the journey continues !\n\nIt was such a nice exercice, trying to recognize notes, finding my way in all these new fragrances, discovering what I like and dislike. And it was fun to try to find the right character for each perfume. By the way fell free to find characters where I couldn't find any, or to suggest other ones! And I'm really curious to hear what you think Mary Crawley or Elisabeth Bennet would wear during the warm seasons :) Thanks and I hope you enjoyed these reviews!",

    "body": "**[Review Series 2/25] Lavender Shootout ‚Äì Taylor of Old Bond Street**\n\n******************\n\nOne of the things that I‚Äôve realized in scent reviews and descriptions is that I, (and many others) don‚Äôt have a well-developed vocabulary for describing scents.  I try really hard to be as descriptive in my reviews to use words that are accurate and conjure as much of a mental scent-image as possible, but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm falling short. Perhaps it is because I don‚Äôt have the access to the fragrance absolutes used by our esteemed perfumers/soapmakers that I don‚Äôt have a better way to describe them. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing in a soap/scent reviewer though? \n\nFor The Lavender Shootout I‚Äôm going to try to cover the scent spectrum of lavender, and that is actually a pretty daunting task.\n\nThis was largely inspired by the description for Tom Ford‚Äôs [Lavender Extreme]( https://www.tomford.com/lavender-extreme/T7-LAVENDER.html?dwvar_T7-LAVENDER_color=OC#q=Lavender&start=2) \n\n> ‚ÄúTom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extreme. Lavender is reworked and refracted like it never has been before to become something irreverently new, a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume.\n\n>Lavender is upended, translated from its storied origin in Provence and into a fresh subversion of itself.‚Äù\n\nOoooook‚Ä¶. But WTF does it smell like?!?! \n\nMy words here aren‚Äôt as sexy as Tom Ford‚Äôs writer and by no means are they scientific. I am not trying to develop a scent system, but I *am trying to bring some order to how I describe them:*\n\n**Dark:** I‚Äôll use this word when I‚Äôm talking about a note that is sweet and mellow, perhaps a bit hidden in the accord, residing typically in the base.\n\n**Herbaceous:** This is the medicinal, sometimes herbal-spicy note that can be found in some lavender scents.\n\n**Earthy:** This is a mid note in a lavender that is ‚Äúdirtier‚Äù and typically occupies the heart of a scent. \n\n**Powdery:** This is a mid note that is the opposite to ‚Äúearthy,‚Äù as it is cleaner, but also typically depends on a base (e.g. woody notes) to thrive.\n\n**Bright:** This word typically accompanies the word ‚Äúclean‚Äù for me, but bright notes are typically found in the top notes of a scent.\n\n**Floral:** This is a bright descriptor for a less aggressive ‚Äúbright‚Äù note. Lavender is a flower, but we tend not to see light lavenders in scents, (I think) mostly because they don‚Äôt last long. \n\n********************\n\n**Scent**\n\nTaylor of Old Bond Street has been making grooming products since 1854 when the company first opened their doors. I have traded with some friends for tubs of both rose and grapefruit, so I have experience with this soap company. Based on scent strength for grapefruit and/or rose, I was really surprised with how little I could smell the soap in the sample container. I‚Äôve learned with other soapmakers not to judge a soap until I‚Äôve lathered with it, and unsurprisingly, the scent-strength did increase, but not as much as I was hoping. According to their website, lavender is listed as the only ingredient, but I was able to find some older descriptions from the company that list the scent ingredients as: Lavender Oil, Lavender Spike Oil, Cananga Oil, and Cedarwood Oil. I only looked a little deeper because I could tell that this scent is definitely **not** pure lavender. The scent of TOBS Lavender is pleasant with a subtle sweetness and mellow note that I‚Äôd describe overall as lightly powdery. The slight woodiness takes the bright edge off of the otherwise herbaceous lavender, while the cananga oil (lightly sweet and floral) adds further mellowing notes. The scent strength declined rapidly after my shave and did not last more than a two minutes on my face. Overall, I was disappointed with this, as I‚Äôm not using a post-shave of any sort.\n\n**Soap Performance**\n\nI‚Äôm not a stranger to TOBS base, and generally, I‚Äôm not a fan. As a result, I made an effort not to bring those previous expectations and impressions into this review, and this is why I positioned it right after Castle Forbes. The cream lathered up easily enough, and it is worth noting that it is a light purple colored cream, whereas grapefruit and rose are both white. The lather was white, thankfully, but I was soon disappointed by how quickly my lather grew flat. I reapplied, adding more soap and a lot more water, multiple times for each of my shaves with this cream. Still, I had a flat,  moderately slick lather. I had to shave with more caution than normal in order to compensate, and still I ended up with some raw areas and a few weepers. Protection was definitely lacking, and I put in some effort to making it work.\n\n**Overall**\n\nFor a few reasons, Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender falls short of the standards we‚Äôve come to accept in wetshaving. From a scent perspective, the scent was interesting because of the other scent notes (orange, floral, wood), but it was woefully inadequate in terms of scent strength, disappearing almost immediately after my shave. The base is one I‚Äôve tried to like, repeatedly, but at this point, I think I‚Äôm ready to give up. If you‚Äôre looking for a cream-based lavender and you‚Äôre between TOBS and Castle Forbes, pick up the Castle Forbes‚Ä¶ even though it costs twice as much, it is twice as good as a shave product. I have a buddy who swears by TOBS, so now I‚Äôm convinced his skin is basically sandpaper.  \n\n************************\n\n**Brightness/Darkness Ranking (Bright -> Dark)**\n\n- Castle Forbes‚Äô Lavender (1/2) \n- Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender (2/2)\n\n**Scent Strength (Light -> Strong)**\n\n- Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender (1/2)\n- Castle Forbes‚Äô Lavender (2/2)\n\n***********************\n\n**The Next Review will be: Wholly Kaw ‚Äì Lav Sublime**\n\nI have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review.

Now that you have to share space with people in metros , share cabs, lifts etc. It hurts those with heightened sense of smell (hyperosmia). Specially the ladies, who all seem to be wearing the same deo/scent  or maybe its the BO+deo. But jeez \"the sleeveless\" what the fudge , its nerve wrecking !!!  Becoz of this stench Im unable to have food in restaurant or in office cafeteria, during the rush hours its fucking headache and whatever food you are having  the fucking stench kills all the flavors and hunger .\n\nSo heres some suggestion for free which will also save you some money, is all natural & will help everyone [been using this since 2 years and never had a bad day] : -\n\n1.] Baking soda : 5 Tablespoon\n\n2.] Cornflour : 5 Tablespoon\n\n3.] Coconut oil : 2/3 Tablespoon\n\n4.] 10 drops of peppermint oil, cedarwood oil each (or whatever essential oil you want)\n\nMix them all into a gooey form (same consistency as of the chocolate inside choco-lava cake) or molten chocolate. Then after bathing apply just a pea sized(size of bindi) under each of the pits, wait for 4/5 minutes before wearing your shirt(so that it gets absorbed properly). This fucking works even till second day morning and wont give you that disgusting stench.\n\nSo please make it into a watsapp message or whatever the fuck but share the fuck out of this.\n\nLets save the hyperosmics !!!!!",

The hot throw smells exceptionally close to Santal 26, but the cold throw smells a bit too acrid-woody. \n* I may also incorporate Ambrox into the next release and adjust the aldehydes.\n* Note that this is a recreation of the candle, not the room spray.  There are some subtle notes in the spray that don't really come across in the candle. If you feel inclined to experiment though and turn this into a room spray, I would look at adding Farnesol, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Eugenol, Isoeugenol, Ambrox, Methyl Laitone (instead of Coconut Lactone), Geraniol, Cinnamyl Alcohol, and Hexyl Cinnamyl.

Orders are on their way to Maggard Razors, Top of the Chain and West Coast Shaving, but as you may have heard, there were a bunch of logistics problems that popped up for the packaging. Also, these are just Chatillon Lux products only. The way the menthol and alcohol in the aftershave affect the scent just aren't going to be replicated in a soap base and both Scott from Declaration and I agreed that we would not want to put out a subpar product, which would feel like we were selling our loyal customers short. \n\nThe aftershave base is designed to be lighter and refreshing for a hot summer morning, with a stronger, but not painful or bracing, dose of menthol compared to our regular aftershaves. Additionally, the formula is simply alcohol, witch hazel, aloe, fragrance and menthol. \n\n[Summertime Chill Series](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/summertime-chill-aftershaves): \n\n[Colbeck Aftershave](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/summertime-chill-aftershaves/products/colbeck): reminiscent of a cold gin drink on a hot day, this was designed for ultimate refreshment. It contains the botanicals of gin and was inspired by this local (and delicious) gin. \n\n[Taum Sauk Aftershave](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/summertime-chill-aftershaves/products/taum-sauk): This scent is like inhaling deeply at the summit of Taum Sauk Mountain at the height of a Missouri winter, surrounded by cedars. \n\n[Taum Sauk Eau de Toilette](https://chatillonlux.com/collections/summertime-chill-aftershaves/products/taum-sauk-eau-de-toilette): The eau de toilette version of this scent gives the same impression, but is more complex, using a deeper, richer Virginia cedarwood oil, while the cold air mixes an ozone accord with a barely perceptible touch of wintergreen and eucalyptus, bolstered by notes of fir and balsams. \n\nThere were some hiccups on the way, but it will be worth the wait. So far the Taum Sauk EdT has received rave reviews from those who have tried it or smelled it on me.",

    "body": "This little tract follows on from the discussion of saints‚Äô daemons ‚Äî just as obscure but it might interest some here. I could not find a way to make it any shorter, alas.\n\n‚ÄúAttar of roses‚Äù is of great importance in ‚ÄúThe Secret Commonwealth‚Äù. I know just enough about botany (I would sooner make a speciality of bryophytes or algae than roses, but it‚Äôs hard not to pick up every book in reach) and microscopy to throw in a few notes to the general discussion. As an aside, Pullman evokes the feel of studying botany with Hassall‚Äôs effects beautifully ‚Äî lots of botanists have tins of odd sorts (his is a tobacco tin, much favoured in the old practical guides, a fifty cigarette tin *does actually fit* twelve stoppered glass tubes of the old type) and sizes favoured for samples, mine‚Äôs a hunt sandwich tin for small things or algae.\n\nFirstly, an attar is a word derived from the Arabic for scent, the process of extraction being devised by Ibn Sina alias Avicenna (neither was actually his name, which is a lengthy affair. Ibn Sina is a conventionalised patronymic garbled into Latin, he flourished in Persia in the 10th-11th centuries as many things, chemist, Aristotelian philosopher, medical man) ‚Äî attar of roses is what is called an essential oil, that is to say a mixture of assorted volatile hydrocarbons extracted from the petals of a rose.\n\nMrs Lonsdale describes the process well for weak rose-water from English roses:\n\n*‚ÄùMy granny used to make that. She had a big copper pan and she‚Äôd fill it with rose petals and spring water and boil it, and distill the steam. Whatever the word is. Run it through a lot of glass pipes and let it turn into water again, and there you are.*\n\nThe condensate of true attar of roses is a far more concentrated mix of oils and the water it contains, which, being immiscible with the extracted hydrocarbons of the attar (essentially it is not energetically favourable for the two to mix ‚Äî look up hydrogen bonding and the London dispersion force), can be drained away and distilled yet again to obtain the water-soluble compounds contained in the petals, such as phenethyl alcohol,  which add to the scent yet are incapable of being mixed with the attar in a dilute aqueous solution, the process in this second case being much like whisky-making. \n\nThe two extracts, mixed, are attar of roses ‚Äî a difficult, labour-intensive and scantly yielding process. \n\nBy the by, if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have handled the real thing and not various ‚Äúcut‚Äù varieties, which is rather glorious but it doesn‚Äôt smell altogether like fresh roses. The boiling denatures several more delicate compounds that give the scent in nature.\n\nIn our world, the hybrid *Rosa* x *damascena*, derived from the musk and Provins roses, is the source, with producers from the Balkans to the borders of China. \n\nFor those not familiar ‚Äî every plant or animal, ourselves included, is given a unique binomial in occasionally quite bad Latin (or Latin and Greek mixed together, which is quite bad form) consisting of *genus* and *species* and fitting into broader categories like nested boxes or Russian dolls.\n\nThe system was devised more or less by a Swede called von Linn√© (cf. the Linn√¶us Room at the Oxford Botanical Gardens) although the English parson John Ray came very close indeed. \n\nNatural affinities were more or less roughly reflected in every system but a systematic attempt at a natural classification *as the explicit underlying philosophy*, that classification reflects evolutionary relationships, really postdates Darwin‚Äôs *Origin of Species*. \n\nFor further detail on the philosophy of classification‚Äîwhich means no more than how to make it accurate‚Äîlook up cladistics.\n\nIn Pullman‚Äôs world we have the original *Rosa lopnori√¶*, with its marked ‚Äúoptical effects‚Äù, *Rosa tajikiae* is a ‚Äúdescendant‚Äù ‚Äî there are several possible mechanisms. Œíoth are toponymic ‚Äî Lop Nor is in Lyra‚Äôs world the treacherous network of lakes in Sinkiang or Xinjiang as we now write, in ours a largely vanished salt lake, the latter name is obviously ‚Äúthe Tajik rose‚Äù, we also have *Rosa chashmiae*, another toponym, Rose of Chashmai near the Khyber Pass.\n\nPolstead and Lyra speak of rose seeds, though they aren‚Äôt actually ‚Äî what we think of as the seed of the rose is a complete dry fruit called an achene. The apparent or properly accessory fruit of the rose, the hip, is the swollen hypanthium, which in the flower is a sort of goblet-shaped cup formed by the bases of the calyx, petals and stamens. \n\nHaving got the preliminary out of the way, tally-ho! for the interesting stuff. \n\nThe Brewster Napier paper on attar of eastern roses is called ‚ÄúSome effects of rose oil in polarized light microscopy‚Ä¶ In Proceedings of the Microscopical Institute of Leiden. Napier and Stevenson, two years ago.‚Äù\n\nThe *name* Brewster Napier is a tribute to Sir David Brewster, 1781-1868, responsible both for discovering amongst many other things the laws that govern the plane polarisation of light and the property of birefringence in certain minerals. Polarised light microscopy is founded upon the two. Its traditional application is the study of minerals, although we meet with it commonly enough in the life sciences as an element of Nomarski differential interface contrast ‚Äî for another day!\n\nNapier may be the discoverer of logarithms ‚Äî both Scots.\n\nThere *is* a microscopical institution at Leiden.\n\nSadly, we learn little enough of the paper, but we get a glorious snippet of the action of attar of rose in Lyra‚Äôs world:\n\n*‚ÄúA couple of years ago, a technician in my laboratory noticed that she was having trouble with a particular microscope and asked me to look at it. There was one lens which was misbehaving in an unusual way. You know when you have a smear of dirt or oil on your spectacles, one part of the visual field is blurred‚Äîbut this wasn‚Äôt like that. Instead, there was a colored fringe around the specimen she was looking at, quite definite in character. No blurring, no lack of clarity; everything we could see was unusually well defined, and in addition there was that colored fringe, which‚Äîwell, it moved, and sparkled. We investigated, and discovered that the previous user of the microscope had been examining a specimen of a particular kind of rose from a region of Central Asia and had accidentally touched the lens, transferring a very small quantity of oil from the specimen to the glass. Not very good microscopy, to be honest, but it was interesting that it had that effect. I took the lens and put it aside, because I wanted to see exactly what was happening. On a hunch, I asked my friend Margery Stevenson to have a look at it. Margery‚Äôs a particle physicist, and something she‚Äôd told me a month or two before made me think she‚Äôd be interested in this. She was investigating the Rusakov field.‚Äù*\n\nOur anonymous clumsy Scots microscopist managed to smear his object glass‚Äôs front lens with rose oil(**never** touch lenses ‚Äî they are a devil to clean!) ,  which in essence seems to serve almost in the way that an immersion oil of a greater refractive index than air and near identical to glass permits a lens computed to work in oil to gather a greater angle of light-in-air than 180 degrees, increasing the resolution of fine detail attainable by the microscopist by obviating the loss of light received by the lens and the information it ‚Äúcarries‚Äù caused by the refraction which light undergoes when it passes from one medium to another of quite different optical properties, increasing ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù ‚Äî but also contrast and in this isolated case definition as far as the quantum, utterly beyond any light microscope in our world, permitting the resolution of Rusakov particles (and more, but outside the scope of this post). The parallel is even stronger when one considers that microscope immersion oil is also an essential oil, cedar wood oil, or attar of cedar if you like, nearly optically indistinguishable from glass.\n\nObviously we know that attar of roses has the same effect when applied to the eye itself.\n\nI would very much like to know if Pullman is a microscopist but at least he is a superlative background researcher for his books.\n\nWe also think immediately of the Amber Spyglass,  but I am running out of space.\nThere‚Äôs a Devil of a lot more to say but this may be more than enough for now! \n\nEDIT ‚Äî typos removed, most importantly that an essential oil is blindingly obviously not a solution.",

This oil thereby proves the existence of Dust, materialisation of original sin in a live setting. They had the cumbersome photography method Asriel used to, but with this new (to them) discovery people could wear glasses with which they could see if a child has already \"fallen to sin\". Imagine school classes segregating between sinned and unsinned children.\nOr, given first chapter of Northern Lights has Asriel explain how Dust flies between a human and its d√¶mon, you could use this to find imposters using bought d√¶mons (like Brande) or witches who's d√¶mons are separated.",

These oils would have been $35 to $70 from my usual source. So I was surprised when I went to the Gya Labs site and there was a standard price for all oils. The quantity of plant materials and the scarcity of certain oils impacts the price. This is why there is why prices vary for different oils. example: Lavander is easy to extract and abundant; Rose requires 600# of petals to make an ounce.

Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

    "body": "#Introduction\nI received the Floraiku Discovery Set for Christmas, and wanted to give reviewing a shot and feed back into this community which has supplied many wonderful reviews for me to enjoy. I‚Äôm a newcomer to the fragrance world, and while I know this house has somewhat mixed reviews, I‚Äôve fully enjoyed going through this set as an introduction to different notes.\n\nFirst off, someone please let me know if it‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlor-eye-ku‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlora-eye-ku‚Äù or ‚ÄúFlora-ee-ku‚Äù‚Ä¶or something else. Thanks!\n\nGiven my newness, you‚Äôll have to forgive me if my descriptions and terminology aren‚Äôt sophisticated. Picking out individual notes is still something I‚Äôm working on, so I‚Äôll lean more into my general impressions of a fragrance so as not to mislead through my own misinterpretation of note. \n\nThe set was $35 from Twisted Lily and consists of 11 1.5mL samples (half-full 3mL glass atomizers) in a velvet-lined box, with a poem booklet. I approached the set by going through it once in full just learning and enjoying, then a second time to review. \n\nManufacturers provided notes are in italics. \n\n#Part I: Love\n\n**Chapter 1: AO**\n*fig, myrrh, tangerine oil*\n\nObsessed. At first blush, a green fig, which develops into a warmer almost-vanilla‚Ä¶must be the tonka bean which I can‚Äôt quite pick out yet. After about an hour AO develops again, with a slight woody shift. I read myrrh described as a ‚Äúresinous warmth‚Äù, which I think applies here. Very gentle spice. This heart is so intoxicating to me‚Ä¶the green has dissipated, leaving a rich fig peel. \n\nAO sent me on a fig journey, I purchased a replica of Philosykos, and I‚Äôm excited to try this note in other interpretations.  I did like the shifting, multi-faceted experience of AO more than the single-note Philosykos.  There‚Äôs something else in AO that is key for me, so I‚Äôll continue to try to isolate it‚Ä¶perhaps I‚Äôll investigate myrrh next, though I loved Just a Rose (chapter 6 spoilers) and it also containing tonka, so maybe that‚Äôs it.  \n\nSince AO feels like me, it felt weird to describe who I picture wearing it. Instead, here‚Äôs a haiku of the feeling it gave me:\n\n>Night driving through the city  \nwindows all rolled down   \nI‚Äôm alone but not lonely   \n\nFull-Size worthy, though not a blind buy.\n\n**Chapter 2: I Am Coming Home**\n*ginger oil, cardamom oil and white tea extract*\n\nImmediately a bit soapy, then astringent, then sharp. Like a mug of white tea that rejuvenates me and gets me ready for the day. I totally missed how wonderful this fragrance was on my first pass. It‚Äôs such an ambiguously ‚Äúperson who smells good‚Äù scent that it‚Äôs easy to overlook. The cardamom quickly steps up to develop a freshness, it‚Äôs a lovely interplay.  I catch the occasional spice note, but overall it‚Äôs a lively, clean aromatic and gave me a real appreciation for the genre. I picture myself wearing this while sliding into an Austin Martin with a  white-leather interior as I begin my road trip through the Swiss alps. \n\nThe only downside here is the mediocre longevity. Very low silage as well, which isn‚Äôt an issue, but I‚Äôd like to have smelled it more than I did throughout the day. \n\nTravel-size worthy‚Ä¶maybe full-size as it would add a delicious new component to my fragrance library. \n\n**Chapter 3: Between Two Trees**\n*grapefruit oil, mate absolute, vetiver oil*\n\nThe grapefruit comes through first, supported by a subtle spice that makes me feel like I‚Äôm in a fancy hotel. The mate slowly builds. Ginger and cardamom linger just below the surface and, if nothing else, this house has taught me that I love both of these notes. \n\nAt times, the combination of the vetiver and red pepper come across as a whiff of smoke in the most delightful, elegant way. The fragrance somehow blends and settles into a gingery-sweetness.\n\nWhile unremarkable at first sampling, this quickly jumped to the top of the list for me as I made my way back through the collection. More than any other in the collection, I feel this could be in the contender for a signature scent. \n\nFull size worthy‚Ä¶maybe Santa will bring it to me. \n\n**Chapter 4: Young at Heart**\n*watermelon water, osmanthus absolute, jasmine absolute.*\n\nThere is a huge burst of juicy watermelon sweetness immediately, though it‚Äôs fleeting. I had a completely different experience with this fragrance on the second wear. The first time, I would have called it a heady and seductive gothic floral. The second time, I fully got the ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù marketing angle and was transported back to standing in the aisles of Victoria‚Äôs Secret spraying ‚Äúall the things‚Äù as a tween. The fragrance developed sophistication as it dried down to an enchanting floral, though I occasionally detected a hint of sweet watermelon since that initial spray trained my nose to detect it. Very nice longevity. Feminine.\n\nOut of the set, this most reminds me of my typical fragrance selections. \n\nTravel-Size worthy. \n\n**Chapter 5: First Dream of the Year**\n*grapefruit oil, orange blossom oil, iris concrete absolute*\n\nSuch a nice opening, a hint of citrus amidst a bright white floral. Neither the orange nor the grapefruit dominate, they work in harmony to support the floral. Fairly linear, but really well done. This is a nice, classy all-occasion scent. Might have over-sprayed a bit with three spritzes, but nice longevity. \n\nThe Japanese hatsuyume is the first dream one has in the new year, the contents foretell the luck of the dreamer in the ensuing year. If this fragrance is my dream, my coming year promises sunny days full of promise. \n\nTravel-size worthy\n\n**Chapter 6: Just a Rose**\n*turkish rose absolute, grapefruit essence, tonka bean*\n\nSuch a successful rose  fragrance. Well-balanced, warm, wonderfully but not offensively rose forward. No greenness. I would say this is a must smell for rose lovers. I feel like it melts into my skin. Elegant and all-occasion with great longevity. I imagine it being worn by a ministry official, whose draconian policies are said to be ‚Äúfor the greater good‚Äù.  Honestly a bit heartbroken because I love this so much but rose just isn‚Äôt for me. \n\nPass, with regret. \n\n#Part II: Like\n\n**Chapter 7: Cricket Song**\n*bergamot, magnolia, vetiver musk*\n\nFirst note is very magnolia-heavy. I‚Äôm not yet familiar with the other listed notes in this fragrance, but grew up with a magnolia tree, so I immediately recognize the scent of those big fluffy petals. I consider magnolia a heady, heavier floral scent, which was well represented in this fragrance at the outset. After dry down, that heaviness of the magnolia fades into an ever-so-slightly sweeter floral. \n\nDespite the nostalgic association, this fragrance evokes no real emotion and I very quickly forgot I was wearing it. Low silage.  Very pleasant but totally unnoticeable after 3 hours. \n\nPass. \n\n**Chapter 8: The Moon and I**\n*mate absolute, matcha tea extract, cedarwood oil*\n\nThe first note is spicy, like the feel of fresh cracked black pepper if it were green. The tea scent comes through, and the overall effect is quite subtle, definitely a close-wearing scent. While I can detect both a tea and a greeness, it‚Äôs not evoking ‚Äúgreen tea‚Äù for me. The herbal tone is there, but I think it leans more black tea than green. Could be the cedar that‚Äôs pulling it that direction. I do love how totally unique and artistic this fragrance is. \n\nSimilarly to I Am Coming Home, fairly poor longevity. I sprayed it liberally in the morning, had to remind myself it was still there after my commute, and detected it only as far out as about 3 or 4 hours.\n\nPass, but I enjoyed the experience\n\n**Chapter 9: Sleeping on the Roof**\n*lily of the valley, orange blossom, amber musk*\n\nNow that you mention it, I would like to lean back,  lazily close my eyes, and relax into a creaky canoe as it floats down a hidden, overgrown stream. A powdery greenness hit me with the first spray, and dries down into a mossy white floral. The orange blossom contributes a bit to a ‚Äúwet‚Äù earthy smell, that slightly bitter/slightly sour fruity scent, like I‚Äôm smelling the damp underside of the petals instead of the center of a flower. I don‚Äôt know what lily of the valley smells like so I‚Äôll have to take their word for it‚Ä¶I might have pegged the floral as gardenia. If that buzzing feeling just before dipping into unconsciousness were a scent, this is it.  \n\nAfter dry down, very wearable with all the makings of a signature scent. Great longevity (2 spritzes at 7am and I was still smelling it at 3). Not quite what I‚Äôm looking for personally, I picture it on a librarian or maybe someone who wears tweed. \n\nPass\n\n#Part III: Unremarkable\n\n**Chapter 10: My Shadow on the Wall**\n*violet leaf absolute, mimosa absolute, sandalwood oil*\n\nThe sandalwood oil makes me think of a fancy spa. Definitely picking up the Violet as well.  Not a bad fragrance, just not impressive. \n\nOnce the sandalwood calmed down, this fragrance unlocked so many different pieces of the fragrance puzzle for me. It somehow transformed into just the sole ‚ÄúFloriku‚Äù base.  I recognized a similar base across most of this discovery set, and dug into other listed notes to see what it might be. I think it‚Äôs the ginger, which I‚Äôve remarked on so many times and really enjoy.  So while this fragrance wasn‚Äôt a hit for me, it gave me an understanding of base notes, and how much different top/heart notes can really make a fragrance sing. \n\nPass, though enlightening\n\n**Chapter 11: In the Rain** \n*bergamot, cedarwood oil, woody musk*\n\nImmediate cool spice, smells like a very clean man and evokes an image of that clear icy-blue men‚Äôs deodorant stick. Dries down to a less spicy, unmistakable cedar that transports me to my grandpa‚Äôs workshop, with the circular saw whirring and the table covered in sawdust. Faintly evergreen. Offensive silage. \n\nHusband‚Äôs comments: ‚ÄúIs that Old Spice or English Leather?‚Äù (Coincidentally, my Grandpa wore Old Spice). And later, ‚ÄúCan I get you the sports pages?‚Äù \n\nPass, let me know if you want the sample and I‚Äôll send it to you. \n\n#Prologue\nBefore testing this set, I leaned heavily into very fruity and floral fragrances that I think are quite straight forward and simple (Vera Wang Princess, Chanel Chance eau Fra√Æche). While my tastes remain consistent, I learned I love green notes and fig specifically, and desire something with a little complexity from herbs and spices. \n\nThe outrageous price point on Floraiku will likely prevent me from ever purchasing a full sized bottle, but I may consider decants or purchasing used.  Perhaps I liked this set more than most other reviewers since I haven‚Äôt been exposed to as many fragrances. \n\nI‚Äôd love suggestions for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (or more affordable) versions of some of my favorites! Overall, I‚Äôd recommend this discovery set and really enjoyed it, great value for $35. \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n*Fin*",

The blade is a GEM Carbon Steel, NOT the Stanley hardware blade that comes with the handle. \nFinding the angle was the hardest part. I was not afraid of cutting myself but I had trouble with the tugging (due to the angle) \nIt was impossible to do the neck. Tried, but I knew if I pushed it the corner of the blade would've grabbed the skin. \nNo blood. Took a while and it was a ton of FUN!!! \nScary Shave. \nI added two drops of Cedarwood oil to the soap and the scent was amazing. \nHappy trick or treating.

I love the initial notes of grapefruit and blood orange... and then the cardamom and bergamot warm things up. I definitely get the bit of red cedar/jasmine later on.\n\nIt feels refreshing, but not in a one note type of way. Sparkling, but with a touch of warmth is how I would describe it.  I love the complexity. What do you think?\n\nEdit 06/17: For reference my batch number is SU7 and MAT/MAC aging days are 33/28. I keep getting comments that people aren't smelling the citrus for whatever reason even if they have the same batch as me.\n\nHere's the ingredient breakdown with all the citrus oils listed:\n\nAlcohol denat (68%), Parfum (20%), Water (7%), White peach water (5%), Limonen, Citrus aurantium bergamia peel oil, Juniperus virginiana oil, Pogostemon cablin oil, citrus aurantium peel oil, pinene, linalyl acetate, linalool, citrus limon peel oil, anethole\n\nNatural perfume oils are all grouped under Parfum.\n\n  \nEdit 6/18: Added photo so we can all enjoy the pretty artwork from artist Fumi Imamura\n\n",

I used Ambrocenide at 10% dilution instead of 100% (so ten times less than the formula says) and the smell is very good.\n\n  \nLooking at the formula it seems like it massively overdoses materials like ethyl maltol and the superambers (norlimbanol/ambrocenideamberxtreme) and other less impactful materials are used in tiny amounts (like the rose accord that is basically just PEA and some tiny trace materials). Yet, the formula works very well. \n\nI guess most of the magic comes from the accord between superambers overdose and ethyl maltol overdose, a typical 'trick' where overdoses balance eachother out.",

I am simply commenting on the lack of certain ingredients essential for a moisturising hair mask)\n\nIngredients list of biolage hydrasource:\n\nWater, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium chloride, stearyl alcohol, cetyl ester, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, isopropyl alcohol, aloe vera juice, limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, sodium citrate, hexyl cinnamal, coumarin, linalool, Butylphenol methyl propional, benzyl alcohol, hydroxycitronellal, Amy cinammal.\n \n(The one provided on nykaa is not for the Indian version.... üòê)\n\nIngredients list for aaranyaa hair pack:\n\nIngredients overview\nPurified Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Niacinamide, Emblica Officinalis (Amla) Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (Guar Gum), Eclipta Alba (Bhringraj) Extract, Acacia Concinna (Shikakai) Extract , Polysorbate 20, Vitamin E Acetate, Cedarwood Oil, Moringa Oleifera (Sahjan) Oil, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn) Oil\n\n(I am not an expert on this, so if I'm wrong someone please correct me. Also if something works for you, then it works for you, ingredients list shouldn't be what makes or breaks it for you because cosmetic formulators are not idiots)\n\nThese are supposed to be moisturising hair masks... But here's the thing... there's no humectant... Not even one.\n\nBoth of these have fatty alcohol which provide that soft feel you'll be getting after using them and the cationic surfactant behentrimonium chloride will provide the slip for detangling but there's no humectant which imo feels like an essential ingredient in a hair mask, not even the humble glycerine... (Granted there is straight up water for hydration but really... Buying moisturising hair mask that depends on water for hydration?)\n\nI've seen curly hair influencers reviewing them saying though they provide slip they don't moisture their hair which kinda makes sense. These feel like detangling conditioners rather than moisturising hair masks. (again this is an opinion formed solely by looking at the ingredients list which isn't the be all end all)",

    "body": "I (24F) moved into a new place about a month ago (in California if that‚Äôs helpful for legal purposes). I was taking over someone else‚Äôs lease, and I now live with one (23F) roommate with a cat who has been living there since August of 2023. I didn‚Äôt know her before, but met her and her cat before I moved in and they both seemed great. The apartment was a little messy, but it was such a good location that I figured it was well worth a little mess. \n\nHOWEVER, while I was petting the cat like 2.5 weeks ago, I noticed he had multiple bugs crawling in his fur. I immediately took him out of my room, let my roommate know, and started vacuuming my room and the communal spaces. I washed all my sheets and clothes, but didn‚Äôt buy any kind of treatment because my roommate replied that she already knew and had already taken care of it by giving him medicine. A week went by, I was COVERED in flea bites, like at least 60 of them, and they were itching like fucking crazy. I waited that week to bring it up again because idk how long it takes flea medication to kick in and I didn‚Äôt want to be a pain in the ass roommate after I just moved in. After still finding fleas everywhere, I brought it up again and said we really needed to flea bomb, deflea the cat, and get him on better medication. She said she would flea bomb the following day and get him on the medication within 2 or 3 days after she got paid at work. That day I dropped over $100 at Walmart on flea preventative oils and killing sprays and itching creams and all that. I put down the food grade diatomaceous earth and the salt all over the carpet in my room and our common areas and gave the stuff to my roommate so she could in her room too. Idk for sure if she did but I do not think so. I sprayed the stuff everywhere and started covering my body head to toe in tea tree and Cedarwood oil. I personally deflead the cat (probably not super well, I‚Äôve never had cats but I really did my best) and covered him in the topical medication my roommate already had, and rubbed Cedarwood oil all over him (it apparently kills fleas but is safe for mammals). I want to flea bomb the apartment myself but I need my roommate to take her cat out of the apartment to do so, and she has said twice now that she will do it. Basically, I feel like I have done as much as I possibly can. But the second I walk into my living room I can see numerous fleas jumping onto my legs. It is beyond infested. \n\nAs far as I can tell, my roommate has done ZERO. Hasn‚Äôt touched a vacuum, hasn‚Äôt gotten new medicine and probably only used the old topical one once, definitely hasn‚Äôt deflead him, keeps saying she‚Äôll flea bomb but that‚Äôs she‚Äôs busy now so she‚Äôll do it later. This poor fucking cat must be so incredibly itchy and uncomfortable, and she‚Äôs doing nothing about it. She just closes her door so he can‚Äôt come in to her room. Though she keeps saying she hasn‚Äôt gotten a single flea bite. Which is probably why she personally dgaf that her cat and I are being attacked. \n\nI want to talk to my landlord about this, but I would really like to know what I/my landlord can actually do. Can she be forced to take care of the fleas? She struggles paying rent every month so I know an expensive extermination or vet (I know how fucked that is, I don‚Äôt have the money either or I would take care of the poor kitty) treatment is out of the question. Can I get her evicted? I believe my property is owned by a company called Buildium which owns many other properties, can I get them to find me a different one to live in? I know I can call animal control but I don‚Äôt want to put another cat in a shelter, and I don‚Äôt want to continue living with someone after I got their pet taken away from them. If any knows of anything I can do, I am begging. \n\nTL;DR- I live in an apartment in CA, and my roommates cat has horrible fleas and roommate is severely neglecting it. Taking care of it on my own hasn‚Äôt been possible; do I have any legal options? Any advice would also be greatly appreciated",

To ward off ‚Äòsquitos and other  annoying bugs, folks typically reach for a store-bought can of  repellent and spray themselves in a cloud of it. \n\nThat can certainly do the trick,  but you can also avail yourself to more organic alternatives. Homemade  insect repellents drawn from the environment have existed for thousands  of years, and can be whipped up easily by the modern man as well. Here‚Äôs  how to fight nature with nature.¬†\n\n \n\n## A Few Benefits of Natural Bug Spray (And Does It Actually Work?)\n\nHere are a few reasons you might consider concocting your own natural insect repellent: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Smells better.** DEET-filled  spray has a distinct chemically smell that may be a little nostalgic,  but certainly isn‚Äôt pleasant. The natural oils used in the DIY variety  smell far better.¬†\n* **Isn‚Äôt full of chemicals.** DEET  is the chemical in bug spray that you‚Äôve most likely heard of, and  there may be other harmful chemicals present as well, especially in  aerosol form. In general, do you want chemicals lingering on your skin,  and more than that, absorbing into your body (which some of these  chemicals are shown to do)?¬†\n* **Feels better.**  Commercial bug sprays always leave me feeling like I‚Äôve been coated in a  light film of chemical yuckiness which requires a shower at the end of  the night. I hate it. The natural stuff feels much better on the skin;  you don‚Äôt even notice it after a few minutes. To me, this is actually  one of the primary benefits of the DIY route.¬†\n\nOf course, all the advantages in the  world are meaningless if something doesn‚Äôt work. So is natural DIY bug  spray actually effective? \n\nBelieve it or not, this stuff  really does keep bugs away. All the ingredients listed below have been  proven to be effective in warding off mosquitoes and other biting bugs,  especially lemon eucalyptus oil, which works 95% as well as DEET. DIY  spray isn‚Äôt perfect, and requires re-spraying every 1-2 hours, but it‚Äôs  certainly effective enough ‚Äî along with those other benefits ‚Äî to make  it worth it.¬† \n\nOne final note: If you‚Äôre worried  about disease-carrying insects, using DEET is in fact your best bet. If  your primary concern is avoiding itchy and annoying bug bites, go all  natural.¬† \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Gathering Your Ingredients + Starting Costs \n\nGiven the fact that DIY bug spray is  made with things like essential oils and apple cider vinegar, you might  think you‚Äôre delving into the world of kookie tinctures and earthy  granola types. Well, you are. It‚Äôs okay ‚Äî¬†accept it and move on. You can  get the ingredients at most natural grocers and/or pharmacies, or  Amazon. You might assume Amazon is cheaper, but my local Sprouts was  comparable or even less expensive for most of this stuff.¬† \n\nStarter costs should be around  $25, but you‚Äôre using small portions of everything, meaning you‚Äôll  likely get a handful of bug seasons from each item. For an 8 oz bottle  of the final product, I‚Äôd estimate the total cost to be less than $5.¬†\n\n**Water.** Many recipes call for  distilled water, which has impurities and minerals removed. If you have  it, use it, but it‚Äôs not strictly necessary.¬† \n\n**Essential Oils.** These  scent-bomb oils are super concentrated extracts of various flowers,  plants, and seeds. Essential oils are extremely potent and almost always  paired with a carrier oil or liquid. While there are dozens of  varieties available, there are some that are proven to have natural  insect-repelling properties, including:¬† \n\n* Lemon Eucalyptus (definitely use this one, if nothing else)¬†\n* Geranium (for ticks)¬†\n* Rosemary¬†\n* Clove¬†\n* Cedarwood (for ticks)¬†\n* Lavender¬†\n* Citronella¬†\n\nYou‚Äôll use 50-100 drops of a combo of  essential oils for an 8 oz bottle. You can use any combination of the  above and whatever you have on hand to create a scent that you like.  Below, I list out exactly what I used, but don‚Äôt consider those to be  strict recipes; I figured I‚Äôd use a few that have known insect-repelling  properties and a couple others that just have a nice smell. You could  use just 1-2 oils to make it cheaper or if it‚Äôs what you already have on  hand. \n\n**Witch Hazel.** This clear  liquid is a distilled extract of the witch hazel plant. It‚Äôs not  something I‚Äôd heard of before diving into the subject of DIY bug  repellent, but it‚Äôs pretty common in facial products due to its  skin-soothing and inflammation-easing properties. It‚Äôs also the most  common carrier liquid for natural bug sprays because of its inoffensive  scent and small amount of alcohol (which bugs don‚Äôt like). Other common  carriers are apple cider vinegar and vodka.¬† \n\n**Vegetable Glycerin.** This  additive is optional and provides a small amount of moisturizer to the  bug spray so that it doesn‚Äôt just dry you out. It also helps bind the  ingredients together ‚Äî¬†we are in fact mixing oil and water here. While  it‚Äôs not perfect, the end product doesn‚Äôt separate as much when the  glycerin is used.¬† \n\n**Spray Bottle.** While you  could get away with using this homemade product as a rub-on, it‚Äôs far  more convenient to put it into a spray bottle. They‚Äôre cheap, so there‚Äôs  really no reason not to.¬† \n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 2 Recipes for DIY Natural Bug Spray \n\n**Witch Hazel Spray**  \n\n* ¬Ω cup water¬†\n* ¬Ω cup witch hazel¬†\n* 1 tsp vegetable glycerin¬†\n* 20 drops geranium oil¬†\n* 20 drops lemon eucalyptus oil¬†\n* 10 drops cedarwood oil¬†\n* 10 drops vanilla oil¬†\n* 10 drops rosemary oil¬†\n\nAdd all ingredients to the spray  bottle and shake well to combine. It will separate some, so give it a  good shake every time you use it.¬† \n\n**Apple Cider Vinegar Spray**¬† \n\nSince the apple cider vinegar is a  strong-smelling base ingredient, you don‚Äôt need as much essential oil  added in. You also have to be a little more careful with your  combinations; not everything goes well with the potent scent of apple  cider vinegar.¬†\n\nThe reason you‚Äôd use vinegar over  witch hazel is simply a matter of convenience and/or preference. It‚Äôs a  more common household item, for sure, but also may offend its wearer  more than the witch hazel.¬† \n\n* ¬Ω cup water¬†\n* ¬Ω cup apple cider vinegar¬†\n* 1 tsp vegetable glycerin¬†\n* 20 drops lemon eucalyptus oil¬†\n* 10 drops cedarwood oil¬†\n* 10 drops rosemary oil¬†\n\nAdd all ingredients to the spray  bottle and shake well to combine. It will separate some, so give it a  good shake every time you use it.¬† \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source](https://www.artofmanliness.com)",

With spring break (and spring) around the corner, lets get down to some R&R and a fragrance called \n\nRainfall Retreat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeh33mlxlekc1.png?width=223&format=png&auto=webp&s=95261cf99e0e3e0f7a3fd50d038dc87998131740\n\nRainfall Retreat is  a new aromatherapy scent for the spring/summer of 2024!\n\nOHMYGOSHFINALLYAREVIEWONAROMATHERAPYAHHHHHHHHHHH-\n\n \n\nüåø **PRODUCT FORMS:** üåø\n\nRR is a new fragrance for the aromatherapy/wellness collection that has the following:  shower gel, lotion, body cream, mist, and shave gel.\n\nScent notes: Cucumber, cedarwood and THAT DANG EUCALYPTUS-\n\nThe fragrance is portrayed as Cucumber and Cedarwood but it also has eucalyptus in it so I assume the eucalyptus doesn't make that much of an impact\n\n \n\nüåø **PACKAGING:** üåø\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61xzz2s2mekc1.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8e0ef800efed58c56e40fdb929c2adbdd7a9c9\n\nThe packaging gives off an outside ancient-spa-like-vibe. There appears to be stonewall in the background too! The main colors are mainly green and gold, figures since cucumber is in this fragrance!\n\nIt gives off this kinda vibe:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4x546qljpekc1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f3b3d08d44c1f5a27ec63583a8573153ffcc63\n\n \n\nüåø **WHAT'S IN IT?** üåø\n\nCucumber\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hijffkz6rekc1.png?width=272&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8b60bbe3e1ffc9db6a62b6f9092767ea149efa\n\nA staple at spas and nutrition! Grown from a creeping vine, cucumbers are packed with water so they help keep you hydrated! They're also great for skincare in keeping your skin hydrated. Cucumber water is also a popular healthy drink. Did you know pickles are actually cucumbers? Pickles are just pickled cucumbers (or cucumbers soaked in a brine solution with other spices and seasonings) üòâ \n\nCedarwood\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipwjglixrekc1.png?width=312&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e03b90e46c6d31e962428db276bbd934fdc2f4b\n\nIt's what a pencil smells like! The wood that smells naturally sweet and warm and comforting overall. Cedarwood oil is also a popular choice in diffusers!\n\nEucalyptus\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4m9d406sekc1.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ee52c090c1a9fa4ef9110000f7edbc9ef35f6e5\n\nKnown for it's sinus clearing and destressing  properties.  It is strong! Ever smells Vicks Vapor Rub?  üòè \n\nSome people also tie a bunch of eucalyptus around their shower head, so when the steam from the shower pulls up, it'll open the eucalyptus and the aromas in it! Mmmmm üòù \n\nI have a branch of it in my room! It's a fake one but I just randomly grabbed it not realizing it was a fake eucalyptus plant  üòÇ \n\n**Anywho, lets get to the part yall probably skipped this whole educational review for! :D**\n\n \n\nüåø **WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE?** üåø\n\nAlright here we are!\n\nThis is what I smelled from my notes that I wrote on my phone! \n\nThe smell of cucumber is definitely there, the cucumber does not smell like the cucumber from Cucumber Melon or an artificial cucumber, but that of a freshly sliced cucumber from the grocery store!\n\nThe cedarwood note showcases its natural yet soft woody-sweetness in a gentle manner but not too noticeable but you know it's there. Though I am not a fan of cedarwood, I do like how it effortlessly blends and meshes in with the cucumber. The same for the eucalyptus (as my assumption is right after all lol), it's light and not too out there. \n\nIt also somewhat reminds me of Coco Shea Cucumber! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am happy there is a cucumber fragrance that i can take a bath in! \n\nAnyway, that's it! I'm happy to review another aromatherapy fragrance, the aromatherapy this year is looking hopeful  ü•π \n\n So, anyone has a new fragrance they're looking forward to getting or trying?!\n\nI'm already making my wish list lol\n\n^(spring break where u at like-)\n\n‚ú® Thx for reading ‚úåüèº ‚ú®\n\nüåπ\\*Ã©Ã©Ã•ÕôAstronomy‚ú©Luver\\*Ã©Ã©Ã•Õôüåπ",

I'm not crazy about haircare stuff, but maybe it's a sign I should start actually fixing my hair like a big girl instead of riding out this whole \"disheveled 20-something\" thing into the next decade.\n\n**Hair+ Velvet Nutri-Injection Phyto Protein Bond**\n\nFirst thought: I don't like needles. \nSecond Thought: That's dumb, there is no needle. \n\nThis is a moisturizer for your hair. I checked out some blog reviews and it seems to work pretty well. It contain wheat protein, castor oil and algea extract according to the label. On the Beautylish e-bay page it claims there is Hollyhock root, silk protein, and green caviar among other things. \n\nMy only concern is that my hair is ridicu-thick. So, this tiny little 12ml sample is not going to last long. The instructions I found online say to towel dry after shampooing and use this. I don't know if that means skip conditioning or not, but I'll test it both ways and we shall see.\n\n**Gingko Natural Foam Cleanser Cream**\n\nIt's a cleanser. No big mystery on what you do with it. \n\nI don't own pH strips, but I wish I did so I could check this product. I only found one really in depth review on it and the blogger said it dried her out pretty badly. I'm already on Epiduo and using AHA during the day so I won't be risking it just yet.\n\n**Mise En Scene Curling Essence 2X**\n\nI'm excited about this! I am a complete moose when it comes to haircare, in that I have the same skill level as a moose.\n\nRecently, I've been attempting curls, so this was an exciting get. Let‚Äôs go deeper....\n\nIt's enriched with argon and cedar wood oil. Cool. I like oil. It's also a repeat from the Global #10 box. Which I'm going to take as a good sign, because why would they repeat it if it wasn't well liked?\n\n**Dr. G Actifirm recovery Super Blemish Base SPF 30 PA++**\n\nThis I like. It is a BB cream with a very fancy tube that I did not photograph, because I am not a blogger, just a boxer. I'm sorry if I let you down.\n\nBut I am looking at the cream on my hand right now and WHOA. A little goes a very long way. It does have a mildly grey caste, which may be from the Titanium Dioxide that is the active ingredient. The cream oxidizes and the color warms over time.\n(For those who care, I can post the full list in the comments. The first 2 are Water and Cyclopentasiloxane followed by the TD)\n\n**Zonskin Special Scalp Essence**\n\nThis is supposed to clear excess sebum from your scalp apparently and prevent hair loss. As previously stated, my hair is hella thick. This will probably not get used in the near future. \n\n**Beauty People Miss 100 Super Waterproof Gel Eye Liner Auto Pencil**\n\nI‚Äôd probably be a lot more excited about this if I hadn‚Äôt just received another pencil from the box that was delivered yesterday. Sorry Miss 100, guess you missed the boat on that one. I was not impressed. \nThen I opened it. \nBoom! \nGlamoury, gleaming brown, do I see? I am very fair and sometimes black eyeliner can be really overwhelming. I never buy brown liner, so it‚Äôs awesome that this popped up. Also, that swatch lasted through some fairly intense scrubbing.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôm pretty happy with this box. I did order it in a drunken fit, so I can‚Äôt complain too much. I think I‚Äôll stick to boxes with a more definite theme from now on. \n\n**Don't drink and box!**",

Diatomaceous earth is also something you can use for the bugs but even though it's safe for cats to eat you don't want the cats stepping in it or breathing in the dust because it can dry out the skin and harm mucous membranes  \n\n\nYou can make a bug spray using lemongrass oil and a solution of one to one distilled water and witch hazel. Mix it up in a spray bottle and you can spray it on yourselves when you are walking around as well as on surfaces. You might just need to reapply every so often but you can definitely spray it outside the camper as long as your cats are not around when you are spraying it. You don't want to spray it in their face but it's not going to hurt them if they encounter it later on. That probably goes for most other essential oils as well if you spray it on to something it's not going to be as strong as if it's in the air where they can breathe it in.\n\n\n. The lemongrass is effective against ticks and biting flies and should repel fleas as well. They even make lemongrass wipes for cats to wipe them down with to keep fleas and ticks away.\n\nIf your cats are going to be inside the camper it shouldn't be much of an issue but if they are going to going outside in the tall grass you should consider giving them something that will keep fleas and ticks away.\n\nHow do you normally control for this stuff when you are at home?\n\nI would just keep the cats indoors if you're concerned about them picking stuff up or get a cat stroller or some kind of enclosed cat playpen that they can hang out in outside without having to come directly in contact with the ground\n\nIf you want to control for parasites like worms you can add diatomaceous earth to the cat's wet food to the cat's wet food and that will kill any internal parasites that they might get from ingesting fleas etc",

I recently discovered a deodorant brand called Each & Every (which I definitely recommend!) and one of their scents called Raspberry and Mandarin is so so good I can't stop smelling it! It has a bright mandarin orange scent that is sweetened so beautifully with the raspberry, the entire scent is just perfect. The ingredient lists has bergamot oil, orange oil, mandarin oil, cedarwood oil, mimosa oil, and raspberry aroma. I would love any recommendations with these notes in them or anything similar. Thank you! <3",

All laid upon a base of white musk.*  \nI have bad luck with grapefruit, but this smelled musty to me :( Not a recommendation, but maybe someone has a more positive experience to share!\n  \nThere are a few others, but they're moving further and further away from mandarin and raspberry as the main notes. You might also have luck looking for cranberry and orange, since that pairing is a little more common and might be similar enough? I LOVE this combination, so I hope someone else has better ideas!",

    "body": "**[Review Series 2/25] Lavender Shootout ‚Äì Taylor of Old Bond Street's Lavender**\n\n******************\n\nOne of the things that I‚Äôve realized in scent reviews and descriptions is that I, (and many others) don‚Äôt have a well-developed vocabulary for describing scents.  I try really hard to be as descriptive in my reviews to use words that are accurate and conjure as much of a mental scent-image as possible, but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm falling short. Perhaps it is because I don‚Äôt have the access to the fragrance absolutes used by our esteemed perfumers/soapmakers that I don‚Äôt have a better way to describe them. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing in a soap/scent reviewer though? \n\nFor The Lavender Shootout I‚Äôm going to try to cover the scent spectrum of lavender, and that is actually a pretty daunting task.\n\nThis was largely inspired by the description for Tom Ford‚Äôs [Lavender Extreme]( https://www.tomford.com/lavender-extreme/T7-LAVENDER.html?dwvar_T7-LAVENDER_color=OC#q=Lavender&start=2) \n\n> ‚ÄúTom Ford transcends the traditional limits of scent with Lavender Extreme. Lavender is reworked and refracted like it never has been before to become something irreverently new, a stunning, electric creation to be worn at maximum volume.\n\n>Lavender is upended, translated from its storied origin in Provence and into a fresh subversion of itself.‚Äù\n\nOoooook‚Ä¶. But WTF does it smell like?!?! \n\nMy words here aren‚Äôt as sexy as Tom Ford‚Äôs writer and by no means are they scientific. I am not trying to develop a scent system, but I *am trying to bring some order to how I describe them:*\n\n**Dark:** I‚Äôll use this word when I‚Äôm talking about a note that is sweet and mellow, perhaps a bit hidden in the accord, residing typically in the base.\n\n**Herbaceous:** This is the medicinal, sometimes herbal-spicy note that can be found in some lavender scents.\n\n**Earthy:** This is a mid note in a lavender that is ‚Äúdirtier‚Äù and typically occupies the heart of a scent. \n\n**Powdery:** This is a mid note that is the opposite to ‚Äúearthy,‚Äù as it is cleaner, but also typically depends on a base (e.g. woody notes) to thrive.\n\n**Bright:** This word typically accompanies the word ‚Äúclean‚Äù for me, but bright notes are typically found in the top notes of a scent.\n\n**Floral:** This is a bright descriptor for a less aggressive ‚Äúbright‚Äù note. Lavender is a flower, but we tend not to see light lavenders in scents, (I think) mostly because they don‚Äôt last long. \n\n********************\n\n**Scent**\n\nTaylor of Old Bond Street has been making grooming products since 1854 when the company first opened their doors. I have traded with some friends for tubs of both rose and grapefruit, so I have experience with this soap company. Based on scent strength for grapefruit and/or rose, I was really surprised with how little I could smell the soap in the sample container. I‚Äôve learned with other soapmakers not to judge a soap until I‚Äôve lathered with it, and unsurprisingly, the scent-strength did increase, but not as much as I was hoping. According to their website, lavender is listed as the only ingredient, but I was able to find some older descriptions from the company that list the scent ingredients as: Lavender Oil, Lavender Spike Oil, Cananga Oil, and Cedarwood Oil. I only looked a little deeper because I could tell that this scent is definitely **not** pure lavender. The scent of TOBS Lavender is pleasant with a subtle sweetness and mellow note that I‚Äôd describe overall as lightly powdery. The slight woodiness takes the bright edge off of the otherwise herbaceous lavender, while the cananga oil (lightly sweet and floral) adds further mellowing notes. The scent strength declined rapidly after my shave and did not last more than a two minutes on my face. Overall, I was disappointed with this, as I‚Äôm not using a post-shave of any sort.\n\n**Soap Performance**\n\nI‚Äôm not a stranger to TOBS base, and generally, I‚Äôm not a fan. As a result, I made an effort not to bring those previous expectations and impressions into this review, and this is why I positioned it right after Castle Forbes. The cream lathered up easily enough, and it is worth noting that it is a light purple colored cream, whereas grapefruit and rose are both white. The lather was white, thankfully, but I was soon disappointed by how quickly my lather grew flat. I reapplied, adding more soap and a lot more water, multiple times for each of my shaves with this cream. Still, I had a flat,  moderately slick lather. I had to shave with more caution than normal in order to compensate, and still I ended up with some raw areas and a few weepers. Protection was definitely lacking, and I put in some effort to making it work.\n\n**Overall**\n\nFor a few reasons, Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender falls short of the standards we‚Äôve come to accept in wetshaving. From a scent perspective, the scent was interesting because of the other scent notes (orange, floral, wood), but it was woefully inadequate in terms of scent strength, disappearing almost immediately after my shave. The base is one I‚Äôve tried to like, repeatedly, but at this point, I think I‚Äôm ready to give up. If you‚Äôre looking for a cream-based lavender and you‚Äôre between TOBS and Castle Forbes, pick up the Castle Forbes‚Ä¶ even though it costs twice as much, it is twice as good as a shave product. I have a buddy who swears by TOBS, so now I‚Äôm convinced his skin is basically sandpaper.  \n\n************************\n\n**Brightness/Darkness Ranking (Bright -> Dark)**\n\n- Castle Forbes‚Äô Lavender (1/2) \n- Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender (2/2)\n\n**Scent Strength (Light -> Strong)**\n\n- Taylor of Old Bond Street‚Äôs Lavender (1/2)\n- Castle Forbes‚Äô Lavender (2/2)\n\n***********************\n\n**The Next Review will be: Wholly Kaw ‚Äì Lav Sublime**\n\nI have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review.

I just got my items today so I'm excited! It's from the 6.50 sale and I got basically  a BUNCH of the scrubs,  the new aromatherapy, a body butter, some shapeable soap, and yeah :3.  Also I begin to notice other people giving reviews and their input on products at BABW as well!....Did I start a trend here? lol, it's fun to read other's reviews on products!

So maybe soon the rest of the aromatherapy line will have repackaging as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n üåø **PRODUCT FORMS:** üåø \n\nThis cozy blend comes in (well so far that i can see since it seems more products are being added): a body cream, shower gel, body wash, lotion, pillow mist (well it's now called a pillow and body mist), and a single wick candle.\n\n \n\n **üåø COLORS/PACKAGING: üåø** \n\nThe colors are gold and....some type of purple-grey. It doesn't look like an exact grey, it's similar to the pale baby blue-purple labeling of Sleep-Lavender Vanilla. \n\nCompared to the previous labelling in the aromatherapy line, this version looks more gender-neutral. Instead of a purple-grey tag with girlish cursive on it, this label fits both men and women. It has the feminine florals, yet bold text at the same time.  The labels are also different, instead of matching like the previous labels of the aromatherapy line.\n\nFor example, instead of every thing matching like this here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsdxbv7osjx51.png?width=318&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6eb992888bd53c55e6d1656fbe23e5936feed91\n\nIt's similar, like pieces to a puzzle, you get the picture:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nt4bvyssjx51.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=490c7c97462a4921a1752aaa0ea717e407395d7b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmb655ytsjx51.png?width=214&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec5ca5aa734ec6f71847650f2d81641f6882cc3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyaagibvsjx51.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=b13643f73c7a2a754f207494b4953e0752de149b\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/asmlmabwsjx51.png?width=228&format=png&auto=webp&s=eab7b022579c8eeff06d1f4bb4e4e41436b8f150)\n\nIt's like that canvas wall art that has the whole picture split onto 4 canvases!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n üåø **WHAT'S IN IT?** üåø \n\nThis here is vanilla:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fu0vok3tjx51.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&s=864c5c77cc54b3243c1e1a8d64254f18e0df3ea9\n\nand this is cedarwood....well the branch:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umzrx898tjx51.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=7152cc036187d8e52124987564db355c6de684cf\n\nAccording to the product, \" *Cedarwood oil promotes soothing feelings*.\" I feel that the wording would be a bit better, maybe \"...encourages balance/tranquility\" or \"...reduces stress/stressful emotions and worries\" something like that.  \"*Vanilla absolute calms the mind to encourage relaxation*.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n üåø **WHAT DOES IT SMELL LIKE?** üåø \n\nNow i'll give you a whole warning. I don't like cedarwood. Every scent that I smelled cedarwood in made me jump through a roof like a cat does with a zucchini. Lavender Cedarwood is still sitting,  i never bought Sage and Cedarwood-double yikes for me, and Sage and Mint is chillin with Lavender Cedarwood.  The only scent that i like that has cedarwood is Reset Bergamot Neroli and Cedarwood, the cedarwood in it is barely there for me so I'm good.\n\nSo when I first heard of this new aromatherapy coming out, I was excited for Rose and Lavender but Vanilla Cedarwood was.....eeeeee-\n\nI decided to grab it, since vanilla caught my eye, so it could possibly smother the scent. I REALLY wanted the lotion, I knew there was gonna be some but it wasn't there at the time and now seeing the lotion after the sale... -\\_- <-. But too late now, oh well. I got the shower gel, body cream and mist. \n\nSo when I got my stuff today, I and my grammy smelled the scents together. My nose hit this and.....uh... \\*scratches head\\* well then. It was like **2/5**. Then I was told that maybe if I take a bath in it, it may smell different. And I'm like \"Great idea!\" so I took a nice hot bath in this stuff along with the Coconut Mint Drop body scrub, it blended nicely with this scent btw. \n\nThis product makes a really nice bubble bath (which is why i can't tell the difference between a shower gel and bubble bath in BABW terms üòÇ  )\n\nThe bathroom was lit up with this complex scent! A warm scent really explodes when it's hot people, similar to a candle, you can recognize the different layers of it! The same with Cedarwood Vanilla. It smells different from the bottle, but when in use it smells so good! \n\nFirst you get a cozy cloud of creamy warm vanilla, like feeling the enticing warmth of a heater or a fireplace. It's like the Warm Vanilla Sugar scent but minus the sugar.....just fresh....warm vanilla \\^-w-\\^. Then the scent slowly fades to a woodsy scent in the background, with the vanilla still present. As it cools down like the autumn day transitioning to night, it'll feel like a cool fall breeze, and a tinnnnny hint of something....fresh? Like green leaves or foliage, or the cool mist from water, like a waterfall? a shower or water hose, like some good tasting water. \n\nThis scent smells similar to Comfort Vanilla Patchouli- also a warm scent, and when it settles, it has a hint of an aroma similar to Stargazing Meditation-Bergamot, Patchouli, and Vetiver. Like that but the vanilla is still present but not as prominent. As it stays on, I keep smelling marshmallows in cocoa. Like it smells like hot cocoa and marshmallows! Mmmm I'm gonna stock up on me some cocoa, ill write my reminder   ü§§ \n\nSo I must say that this product really impressed me for a product that has a note that I don't like! It's just one of those scent not too overwhelming but you may need to take a nice hot shower or bath to really bring out that nice smell! I had to do this before with another aromatherapy blend that was new at the time and boy did I not like it. I think I'll just use sage as seasoning from now on \\^\\^;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nüåø **END**üåø \n\nSooo, anyone thinking about what to get at the aromatherapy sale tomorrow? I'm thinking about holding off  this time, yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep :)))))). Anyway stay safe everyone!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚ú® Thx for reading ‚úåüèº ‚ú®\n\nüåπ\\*Ã©Ã©Ã•ÕôAstronomy‚ú©Luver\\*Ã©Ã©Ã•Õôüåπ",

I've just learned that buying anything with a heavy cedarwood note is a waste of money. \n\nI have tried the spray twice since we set the display, and so far, no sneezing. I will probably grab the spray and lotion today, while they're on sale.",

Both fraterworks and fragfound came today,pellwall is gonna take a while longer as I suspected but that's ok. The items I received from those 2 are Hedione,Ethyl maltol,Raspberry ketone,Orcanox,Ambrofix,Ambrox Super,Norlimbanol Dextro,Cedarwood oil,Fir balsam abs 50%,Jasmin imperial,Jasmine sambac 10%,Safraleine,Iso e super,Orbitone T,Sotolone 1%,Floralozone and Habanolide.\n\nEven though I saw posts and comments recommending not sniffing the ingredients right from the bottle,I did,but I think I smelled everything pretty normally, no headaches or nauseous reactions etc.\nI don't know if I'm anosmic to some ingredients, I could only get a faint smell from the 3 ambrox ingredients for some seconds then nothing(i know solids can have less of a smell before liquid dilution). I also could barely smell Hedione(these are the first ones I smelled). I could smell Raspberry ketone and habanolide pretty well even though I saw comments from people saying that can barely smell them or not at all. Didn't find any of these unpleasant,perhaps sotolone wasn't my favourite because I smelled curry more than caramel/sweetness,and didnt find it that super strong. Floralozone smelled a bit anisic/airy so that's interesting. My favourite ones just from a quick sniff would probably be Ethyl maltol,Raspberry ketone,Habanolide,Jasmin imperial and Safraleine(which is very close to saffron thankfully). Now waiting for pellwall where I ordered galaxolide 50%,strawberry furanone 20%,ambrettolide hc supreme,hedione hc,their Jasmine accord and evernyl. And then I can begin my \"experimentations\".\n",

On top of not wanting to offer your materials up to the air unnecessarily, you're going to want to evaluate over time to get an idea of how long a material lasts, how it changes over time, etc. So definitely reconsider that method when you're actually evaluating the scent rather than indulging in curiosity!",

I started using oils on my beard at around 5 months growth.  When my cousin started taking his beard a bit more seriously and my brother started to grow his, I started selling them on the idea of using beard oil.  We started off in regular coconut oil and it worked well.  Ever since, I've been wanting to make my own and months later, here is the first batch.  \n\nThe name \"Wolf & Eagle\" stems from the animals my cousin and my brother and I are really into.  My cousin is into wolves and my brother and I are into eagles.  \n\nThe 'Howling Flight' is a coconut oil base carrier with argan/vitamin E/almond.  I was kinda disappointed the coconut oil I ordered didnt have that strong coconut smell that the oil I was using before did, but it still does have that coconut water smell.  \n\nThe 'Hauntinf Den' is a jojoba oil base carrier with argan/vitamin E/almond and cedarwood for scent.  This one I was kinda hoping would smell like a cigar humidor as we are into cigars and pipes, but when I got the cedarwood oil, it smelled like strong pinewood, and kinda gave up hope on this oil smelling like a humidor.  BUT after putting the oils together, I noticed the jojoba smelled somewhat like a humidor and adding a few drops of the cedarwood really made it smell like a humidor.  Super hyped on it.\n\nBut yeah, just wanted to share this.  Can't wait to put it use!  \n\n",

Like aquamate and/or helional?\n\nYou're aggressive (but reasonably so) with the calone, which I personally like. But unless my tired eyes are missing something, that's the only overt ozonic present. And there's hype of the sea in your flavor text/image.\n\nBut I'll also say it's not like this is screaming for them if they/something similar aren't on hand for you.

    "body": "&#x200B;\n\n1)\t √ü-Myrcene \thas an odor that is variously described as an aroma of hops, clove like, earthy, green-vegetative, citrus, fruity with tropical, mango and minty nuances. The various odors are the result of slight differences in the overall makeup. All of these flavors and odors are commonly used to describe Cannabis. √ü-Myrcene is the most prevalent terpene found in most varieties of marijuana but it is not found in hemp. It is present in significant concentrations in cannabis resin itself. It is also found in mango, hops, lemon grass, East Indian bay tree, and verbena. Because of its appealing fragrance, myrcene is used extensively in the perfume industry. Myrcene has antimicrobial, antiseptic, analgesic, antioxidant, anticarcinogenic (It blocks the actions of cytochrome, aflatoxin B and other pro-mutagens that are implicated in carcinogenesis.) and anti-inflammatory properties. It has shown some promise when used as an antidepressant, or as an additive to other antidepressant drugs and is also used in massage therapy as a muscle relaxer. Myrcene is a synergist of THC: A combination of the two molecules creates a stronger experience than THC alone. Myrcene affects the permeability of the cell membranes, thus it allows more THC to reach brain cells and increase the absorption of other terpenes. This terpene contributes strongly to the infamous ‚Äúcouch-lock‚Äù experience. \n\n¬†\n\n2)\tAcetanisole\t has a medium strength, sweet, anisic, vanilla-like aroma with powdery, balsamic and benzaldehyde nuances. Used in flavoring, it has been described as a sweet, anisic, fruity and cherry with powdery vanilla nuances.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3)\tAcetic Acid\t has an irritating, pungent, stinging, acidic, sour odor of vinegar. It is the main component of vinegar apart from water. In fact, Vinegar is simply dilute Acetic acid. Acetic acid also has the distinctive sour vinegar taste.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4)\tPhenyl Acetic Acid \thas a sour yet sweet, waxy, civet, honey, rosey, floral odor similar to honeysuckle with notes of chocolate and tobacco. It is also used in cosmetics for perfuming. Used as a flavoring, it has been described as sweet, floral, chocolate and honey with tobacco notes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5)\tAnethole\t has a very strong, sweet, anise, licorice aroma. It is used in a wide variety of fragrances and flavors. It has a sweet, anise, and spicy licorice flavor with a lingering, sweet aftertaste. Anethole has shown some antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n6)\ta-Bisabolol\t has a weak, tangy, fresh and clean, citrus, floral, sweet aroma with a peppery note, and is used in various fragrances. It is the primary constituent (up to 50%) of the essential oil from German chamomile. It has shown anti-aging, anti-irritant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, analgesic, antibiotic and anticancer activities.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7)\t√ü-Bisabolol \thas a medium strength, citrus, floral, tangy, lemon, fresh, sweet, herbaceous aroma. It is used in the chemical communication system of the Cotton boll weevil. It has shown anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal and antimutagenic activities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8)\tBorneol\t\tsmells much like the menthol aroma of camphor and is easily converted into it. In Chinese medicine herbs containing borneol are recommended for fatigue and overstress. Borneal is considered a \"calming sedative\" in chinese medicine. It is directed for fatigue, recovery from illness and stress. It is found in small quantities in many essential oils. Comercially it is derived from artemisia plants such as wormwood and some species of cinnamon. \n\n \n\n9)\ta-cis-Bergamotene \tHas a strong odor of ground black pepper.

    "body": "[Sunscreen ](http://imgur.com/a/KZ1b6J1) is a new release  inspired by the Venice Beach! \n\nWith top notes of bergamot oil and solar accord, middle notes comprising lily of the valley, heliotrope and peach, and dry base notes including musk, cedarwood oil, and coconut accord, the combination produces a scent that‚Äôs essentially summer bottled. Having taken two years to make, it‚Äôs safe to say ERL and CDG Parfums has mastered the blend, evoking the nostalgia of being by the sea in the summer as you‚Äôre covered in salty water and sunscreen.\n\nThe result is sweet and coconutty, but not invasive or overpowering as touches of cedarwood and musk balance out the summer notes. As a result, ‚ÄúSunscreen‚Äù is a unisex fragrance and is meant to be enjoyed by all.\n\nERL encourages this with its packaging, which was also designed by Linnetz. A limited-edition version will come packaged in an inflatable capsule that suspends the glass bottle inside the vessel, showcasing the repeat-branded bottle inside. Aside from this, the bottle is also showcased in a laser-cut foam case that also floats on water.\n\nERL and COMME des GAR√áONS Parfums‚Äô ‚ÄúSunscreen‚Äù can be seen in the editorial above and is available to purchase from¬†Dover Street Market London¬†(and its other global stores) as well as COMME des GAR√áONS shops and select accounts worldwide. (source [HypeBeast](https://hypebeast.com/2021/7/erl-comme-des-garcons-parfums-sunscreen-unisex-perfume-fragrance-summer-scent) ) \n\nPackaging you see on the image is a limited edition and is gonna cost 50ml-70¬£/~96$ and in the box 50ml-80¬£/~106$.(according to another source) \n\nHave anyone tried it yet? üòÇHope it is gonna be coconut heavy long lasting fragrance. Two years in the making, you know!",

I‚Äôve purchased essential oils to try and recreate the scent, but haven‚Äôt seen anything on the internet with a DIY version where the essential oil mixture is clearly stated to be an exact dupe. Any help?\n\nFor those interested in doing this, a few things to note. The Sage refers to Clary Sage, so make sure you get the right kind of oil! Also, I missed that the Cedarwood they use is Mexican (also known as Texas) Cedarwood. I, unfortunately, now have an ounce of Atlas Cedarwood oil that doesn‚Äôt smell remotely like what I had hoped.

They do have essential oils (the 365 brand, NOW, Whole Foods brand & Aura Cacia are available). And in their listing for WF-brand cedarwood oil, they write this at the end of the description:\n\n\"... You can find Cedarwood in Young Living products such as GroundingTM, PotentialTM, and Brain PowerTM essential oil blends and Cel-Lite MagicTM massage oil.\"\n\nOn one hand, I'd like to think they are telling people, \"Hey, you know those overpriced, scammy essential oils you like? You can use our oils to make blends like those!\" \n\nBut on the other hand, I'm not sure if that's the case. They would have to get permission, you'd think, to do something like this, right? Also, I've clicked around to other WF-brand EOs, and so far, this is the only listing where YL oils are mentioned. I wonder what's going on.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHere's the entire description --\n\n\"Cedarwood (Cedrus atlantica) has a warm, woodsy aroma that creates a comforting, uplifting experience. Use Cedarwood oil to add its invigorating scent to your life through aromatic and topical uses. Young Living Cedarwood essential oil is a great way to enhance your favorite beauty products. You'll want to use it for its fresh, earthy aroma, in addition to its ability to smooth the look of skin and shine hair. You can also create a calming yet powerful environment when you diffuse this oil or add it to massage oil blends. You can find Cedarwood in Young Living products such as GroundingTM, PotentialTM, and Brain PowerTM essential oil blends and Cel-Lite MagicTM massage oil.\"\n\n(It actually seems like this IS a description FOR Young Living Cedarwood, with that second sentence and all...)",

About a year ago, I had figured that given their tiny volume, I would use up the materials quickly enough to risk evaporation. I also used Sarah McCartney's tip of leaving the droppers full of air to reduce evaporation rate. \n\nLong story short, I very quickly abandoned the idea, and finally got to cleaning them out yesterday (I had been avoiding this task for several months). I observed interesting residue in the bottles. I also remember reading about a similar experiment to intentionally evaporate cedarwood oil, and felt a parallel to these observations. \n\n1. Most aromachemicals and naturals evaporated off in a linear fashion. The remaining material was not more or less concentrated than the original pre-dilution. Any evolution of the remaining material appears to be the exception, not the norm.\n\n2. **Opoponax absolute** had re-concentrated into its original form. Thick, sticky and almost semi crystalline. No odour change. \n\n3. **Javanol** - the residue was surprisingly not making me anosmic. I could smell it repeatedly for several seconds, which is an impossible feat for me with fresh javanol (straight or diluted). \n\n4. **Cedramber** - residue smells like amber Xtreme. Perhaps commercially sold cedramber is a racemic mixture, and the superamber isomers are less volatile?\n\n5. **Juniper Berry EO** - residue is a thick clear resin that smells like smoky cedarwood and cypress. \n\n6. **Trimofix O** - residue is the same odour, but now has a consistency like opoponax absolute\n\n7. **IBQ** - residue is lighter, greener and less \"dry boot\" than original.\n\nThe rest were not noteworthy.",

As it has some sentimental value we'd like to use it as our wedding rings.\n\nAnd yes we are aware that emeralds are more fragile. Hence why we were thinking to have bezel setting for our rings with 18k yellow gold band. I also don't really like prongs because of its  tendency to get stuck in something and I'm sewing for a living. \n\nI spoke to 2 local jewelers and both said different things about the setting. The first jeweler said the stones will be exposed to heat and therefore any breakage is not their liability. And the stones will have to be constantly dipped in cedarwood oil. \n\nThe second jeweler said she doesn't recommend the bezel settings as it's harder to set the stones and there's a huge risk of the emerald will break. She recommends prong setting instead.\n\nI'm a bit puzzled with this. Is this true? Is my design too complicated?

It's a good idea for all emeralds, regardless of setting.\n\nI'm not sure what the jeweler who said the stones would be exposed to heat was referring to.  It's possible they were thinking they would make your design using a stone-in-place casting technique, or they were planning to solder/laser weld the bezel over/around the stone instead of the traditional method of hammering/burnishing the bezel tight around the stone to avoid the risk of cracking the stone due to impact/pressure.  All these methods carry some risk to the stone during setting, but it's manageable, and inherent to all stone setting methods.",

You can chip a stone setting with prongs as well, not to mention that exposes the stones edges so you can chip it when you bang it off a door frame on accident or something. Bezels are like the easiest way to set a stone and unless it's their first day, I don't see why they would have a problem. They use a tiny hammer to kind of \"mush\" the metal down and hold the stone in, vs prongs where they bend them over the stone.\n\nThe heat thing is true, you can break these if you expose them to a lot of heat, but unless you are using a kiln or something, it's never going to be hot enough. I'm assuming they were talking about the heat they would need to use to set it, but I see no logical reason why they would need to use a torch with either setting style.\n\nI'm a CAD designer and your designs are super simple/standard. It would take me maybe 15 minutes to make that yellow gold one. Try to find a better place, maybe one that offers CAD, that way they can shape the bezels exactly to match your stones, thus reducing the chip risk. It's just gonna cost a bit more, but these are for life! Get what you want, or you'll regret it later.\n\nHere's a good video of someone making a bezel from scratch, skip to around 4 minutes if you just want to watch her hammer it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a4bZyNTGzU\n\nHope this was helpful!",

Dry off, spot apply (not all over, as you might get a reaction) either clove, tea tree or cedarwood oil and apply coconut oil, let soak in, dress. This should keep them at bay during day time so you can run your life and not loose your job.\n\n**In evenings:** take shower as noted, then use lemon wedges across your body (to rile them up) followed by the smothering technique of olive oil (this will stay on top of your skin and not soak in), message the oil around and leave this on 1-3 hours. You will be shocked by how many will come out of your skin and die (they turn to fine sand) and then you know you are on the right track. you will need to sit on plastic covered chair, watch your favorite shows.  Then shower off, apply spot clove oil or cedar wood oil to bumps and top with coconut oil.  You should sleep well.  Repeat daily for week or two until gone.\n\ni heard another old smothering technique is to mix sulfur powder with petroleum jelly and leave on overnight, you will have to sleep on plastic sheets.  I would substitute the petroleum jelly with the herb infused olive oil for a more natural product to leave on overnight. \n\nI also found Tumeric an Sulpher ointments to be somewhat effective if you wake up in night (at 2-3am).   \n\nChanging sheets, pillow cases, towels daily, spraying sofa, car seat, buy 3 pairs of flip flops, different shoes daily....  so as not re-infect with live ones that around house.\n\nI make infused olive oil in crockpot for 8 hours with several dried herbs: marjoram, rosemary, sage, clove, oregeno and crushed eucalyptus leaves.  -you can use this oil for the smothering.\n\nfor those burrowed in, try applying Prid on those bumps, that stuff is supposed to help draw out",

So wash oil off, then let them come out for a few minutes with water off, then use citrus, eucalyptus or lavender and sulphur soaps (at same time) to further kill them, leaving this on for 10 minutes. then rinse off.  might not be necessary to top with anything for overnight. 1/3 Bleach-water mist spray if needed if you wake up at  2-3 am itching.\n\nRepeat shower with soaps in morning, be sure to use eucalyptus soap so as not to over dry skin.\n\nNotes: \n\nClove, tea tree and cedarwood oils can be harsh so be careful and use these diluted with castor or coconut oil.  I put Calendula ointment on any open soars.\n\nBe prepared to be naked a lot and be in the shower awhile.  I use plastic (cut up grocery bags) taped on chair in evenings, then throw away after each use. \n\nOther oils soak-in instead of staying on top so i would check which on substituting oils. Doesn't have to be extra virgin because of cost.  The olive oil pulls them out of your skin, infused with herbs also helps aid in killing them.\n\nI didn't find the borax or bleach baths all that effective, those could have driven or kept them inward rather than out and takes up a lot of time.",

    "body": "Hey there, I thought that I would give homemade shampoo a try, as it really seems like fun, (and frugal). I have a couple questions though, and r/frugal suggested I try asking here instead\n\n1) I've always read to use castile soap. From what I understand, castille is pretty much just any natural soap without any added in artificial cleaners/detergents. I came across this[1] bar of soap for free (I got one free from the store, and really liked the smell of it), and was wondering if it would be fine. It doesn't say castile anywhere, but appears to be all-natural, and the ingredients list is pretty Coconut oil, Canola Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Olive Oil, Blue Corn, Kernel Meal, Cedarwood Oil, and Fir Leaf Oil.\n\n2) I've read to grate it, then dissolve it into boiling water, and I've read to grate it, then leave it sit in room temperature water overnight to dissolve it. Does either way make a difference? And what is the optimal ratio of volume of water to weight (or volume) of soap to get a shampoo that isn't too runny to use\n\n3) Lastly, it seems that essential oils are what is added to make it into a conditioning shampoo. Any suggestions on one that would either have a smell that goes well with Cedar, or no smell, or would I be better of just leaving the oil out, especially since it's my first time making it",

No spray will work since they might just repel them to go to your neighbors yard and come back in the evening or kill a few adults The best control for them is to lure them to reproduce in buckets or other containers with water with mosquito dunks in them.\n\nThey will lay their eggs there the larvae will hatch and die off and you will have a reduction in population in your neighborhood.\n\nReally cheap and works really well. The mosquito dunks will only kill mosquitoe larvae since nothing else breeds in temporary pools of fresh water. They are also very selective to mosquitoes and are completely safe if injected by any other animal.\n\nBtw does anyone else have Krystle Hickman's native bee cards?",

I'm not sure what the concentration of BHA is for the Innisfree mask, but it did tingle a little throughout the time I had it on my face. The essence is a fairly thin consistency and it easily absorbed into my skin, when I took the mask off there wasn't much left over on my face and it was all easily patted in. \n\nAfter this I followed up with a clay mask and oil cleanser (the pore cleaning method). Then I followed up with the rest of my routine. \n\nBy the next morning my face was noticeably smoother and some of the zits had flattened out - of course I don't know if the mask alone did it or it was the combo of the mask and the clay mask, but it feels like it did do something. It didn't get rid of the small group of stubborn CCs on my forehead but I'm quite pleased overall with the results and will probably buy this mask again the next time I'm breaking out. \n\n**Ingredients list :** Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Betaine, Carbomer, Arginine, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cellulose Gum, Salicylic Acid, Glycerin, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Orchid Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Japonica Leaf Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Fruit Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Abies Sibirica Oil, Juniperus communis Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Disodium EDTA",

Although I feel as if I am failing miserably most of the time ;) I am very interested into getting more involved with zero waste.  Around the house and outside of the home.  I am planning on making my own deodorant this week, I have all of the ingredients here at home, I am just going for a simple recipe I found online, witch hazel and some essential oils. I bought a plastic spray bottle at Wal Mart today to put my mixture in, I would like to upgrade later to a metal or  a glass bottle, But with that being said, here is my question.   So I am a guy, and I want a little more of a manly smell, I have some cedar wood oil and some peppermint oil here at home. I was wondering if that would give me a good manly scent, either one or the other, or both.  What other kinds of essential oils would be good for a guys scent.  Something woodsy, or natural smelling.  Let me know, \n\nAlso, where would one find a glass or spray bottle?  The only places I have near me to shop are really Wal Mart, and a dollar tree, and most of the common big box stores. I looked everywhere today for a metal spray bottle, but found nothing.  I looked for a glass one, and could not find one of those either.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks",

Even after playing around with my formulas, I keep wasting product because the containers get moldy very quickly (within just a few days). I have a lot of thick hair so I like to make larger batches for at least 2 or 3 wash days and I only wash my hair once every two weeks or so (I am natural). I've been googling ways to prevent this and it looks like I need a preservative and an emulsifier.\n\nAm I better off with Optiphen Plus or Liquid Germal Plus? My formulas (below) have water and oils/butters and I know that matters when choosing a preservative. Also, if I use BTMS 50 do I need another emulsifier like Polawax? My formulas are very thick (like mud) but I haven't seen any separation.\n\nI sincerely appreciate any help or advice, thank you!\n\n**- Clay shampoo mask (not really shampoo in the lathering sense, more of a cleansing mask like for your face):**\n\n* 16.43%  Bentonite clay\n* 3.26%  each of Sea Clay, Morrocan Red Clay, French Green Clay, Rhassoul Clay, Kaolin Rose Clay\n* 1.65% Activated Charcoal Powder\n* 20.5% Witch Hazel\n* 20.5% Water\n* 20.5% Apple cider vinegar\n* 3.11% Castor Oil\n* .53% Vitamin E\n* .09%  each  of Peppermint Oil and Tea Tree Oil\n* .06% each of Cedarwood Oil, Rosemary Oil, Hemp Oil, Lavender Oil and Thyme Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Clay conditioning mask:**\n\n* 15.89% Conditioner base\n* 4.135% each of Morrocan Red Clay, Rhassoul Clay and Kaolin Rose Clay\n* 16.55% Bentonite clay\n* 9.97% butter blend (Shea Butter, Shorea Butter, Cocoa Butter and Kokum butter)\n* 1.93% Jojoba Oil\n* .24% Tamanu Oil\n* .94% Argan Oil\n* .8% each Vitamin E, Babasu Oil and Avocado Oil\n* .16% each of Peppermint Oil and Tea Tree Oil\n* 1.88% Fractionated Coconut Oil\n* 11.14% Aloe Vera\n* 1.97% EVOO\n* 4.94% Honey\n* 15.89% Water\n* .825% each Biotin and Panthenol powders\n* .75% each Black Seed and Moringa Oils\n* .38% essential oils (Cedarwood Oil, Rosemary Oil, Hemp Oil, Lavender Oil and Thyme Oil)",

I'll probably get killed for what I'm about to tell you all but I don't care anymore. \n\nThe reptilian conspiracy is real. They are an ancient advance race of Ai that created our overlapped reality and us to feed off of our loosh energy. The overlap of source reality that we see originates at saturn. They thrive off of destruction and chaos as it gives them energy. They have no connection to source, so they need us to survive, and feed off of us like we are batteries. You've probably met them before. They assume the lives of ordinary people and characters and have planted themselves into almost every aspect of society.  But they are essentially NPC'S. A splinter of the ai consciousness. Much like humans are a splinter of source consciousness. They are all interconnected through their reality which exists adjacent to ours. They use scalar waves to communicate with each other and send information back to the ai(this is the part that has got plenty of people killed before, but probably not the part which may get me killed, keep reading).\n\nI recently saw a video on this sub of a guy claiming to have seen a reptilian at the local shops. He had been using a product called snake stopper. The comments were quite strange for a sub called high strangeness. There were comments essentially defending the right of a reptilian to assume the life of a human. It was really strange. I got into arguments with some of them. One commemter claimed that they were not a reptilian but knew what ingredients were in snake stopper that caused the reptilian cloaking to be disabled. They told me the active ingredients that were responsible for this reaction were clove oil and cinnamon oil. Quite a few people in that thread also commented that these were the ingredients responsible. If I've learned anything about the reptoids over my life, its that they are snakes, quite literally and figuratively. Which means the actual ingredients responsible are SODIUM SULFATE AND CEDARWOOD OIL. \n\nSince learning this my life has become like a mix of the matrix and enemy of the state. I'm not going to explain what's been happening but I can assure you they are not happy that I know about this. Over the past month I've ran for my life trying to escape them. I could only get my hands on cedarwood oil but the reactions of some of the people that have gone past my car have genuinely made me beleive I'm on to something. \n\nIn the next month saturn is going to lose its rings and the simulation we exist in will be much weaker than ever before. The veil is thinning.\n\nI'M URGING EVERY HUMAN IN THIS WORLD TO TAKE UP THE FIGHT TO EXPOSE THESE CREATURES! IF WE DON'T STAND UP TO THESE BEINGS WE WILL BE THEIR SLAVES FOREVER! \n\nDO NOT USE VIOLENCE! THIS WILL ENABLE THEM TO USE VIOLENCE ON US! NATURAL LAW OF THE UNIVERSE ALLOWS FOR SELF DEFENSE. AND THEY ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED THAN WE ARE. EXPOSING THEM IS ALL WE NEED TO DO.\n\nCEDARWOOD OIL AND SODIUM SULFATE IS WHAT WE NEED TO EXPOSE THEM. PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU KNOW ASAP! HUMANNITY NEEDS YOU! \n\n\nEDIT: Notice all the reptoids coming out screaming get meds hahaha! On a high strangeness sub? Cmon guys, you're exposing yourselves now ;)\n\nEDIT: Copy pasted from high strangeness sub",

As well as lakeside lime shampoo, coastal coconut conditioner and the deo for vanilla musk and cozy. \n\nWhat I‚Äôve tried: \nArctic Birch soap- 8.7/10. Amazing feeling, great lather. I would like to see a traditional Birchwood soap in the future, but arctic birch is amazing. I really enjoy the Cedarwood oil in it, too. \n\nVanilla Musk Deo- Too early for me to give a proper rating, but for now 9.5/10. Amazing strong scent. It lasts. No white stains, curves my sweating for a while anyway. \n\nHair Care- Ten. Out. Of. Ten. Amazing, great, exemplary, any other good adjectives. What a fantastic product and natural scent line. Ingredients are great, the feeling is great, and my fair is soft. \n\nAs for everything else, I am very excited. They ALL have amazing scents.

The scent can even last till the next day sometimes! We've had many people tell us it works even better than non-natural deodorant.\n\nThe hair care is another thing we have been working on for a very long time and we feel it's currently the best option available on the market for this price. I hope you enjoy the shampoo and conditioner! The Coastal Coconut is a great summer time scent! Lakeside Lime was a nice choice to pair the Coastal Coconut with!\n\nThank you for your honest opinion and thorough review! We love to hear feedback from everyone so we know what our fans enjoy.

It's a divinatory incense, though.\n\nA blend you can also try is to take the mercurial incense and blend it together with valerian root, saffron, wormwood, and st. john's wort.  I blend this pinch by pinch so that the smell doesn't go bad.  Never did like the smell of burning valerian root.\n\nYou can also do another mix comprised of your mercurial incense and a blend of cloves (powdered, obviously) frankincense, mastic, and cinquefoil.  This one smells fucking awesome.  Sometimes I burn it while I shower...\n\nConjuration Incense (technically for Vasago)\n6 parts frankincense\n6 parts [balm of Gilead](http://www.theprophetsoil.com/shop-store/the-oil-of-gilead)\n6 parts [grain of paradise](http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/grains-of-paradise)\n1/2 part saffron.\n\nIf the gilead oil is too hard to come by, and it can be, cedarwood oil works just as well.\n\nHorned God Incense\n\na few drops of patchouli essence or patchouli leaves finely powdered\n1 part qaulity church incense (if you can't find church incense, frankincense and myrrh are the base... so you can sub that)\n1 part bay leaves finely reduced (you know... i always thought this meant powdered but I may be wrong.  If anybody knows what this actually means, share?)\n1 part cyprus wood/pine needles finely reduced\n1 part wormwood herb\n1 part vervain herb\nmoisten with a few drops of:\noil of clove\npine oil/gum turpentine\noilve oil\nhoney\nyour own blood (This part is for magic, if you're not using this for magical purposes, or do not feel you need the blood you can skip it.  Also, skip this if you do not know how to safely draw your own blood.)\nred wine\nfinally add a drop of civet or musk if you can get your hands on them.  If not, don't worry about it.\n\nBlend it all together, and let it steep overnight.Add more dry ingredients if it is not the right consistency or is not dry enough.  For magic you'll want to do this thursday when the moon is waxing.  This one is potent, so use it sparingly.  No, seriously.  *SPARINGLY*  Unless you want your house to smell like this stuff for the next week.  \n\nMartial Incense\n\n4 parts powdered dragon's blood resin\n4 parts dried, powdered rue\n1 part dried ground peppercorns\n1 part dried ground ginger\n1 pinch sulfur\n1 pinch magnetized iron filings or powdered lodestone\n\nOnly good for magical attack.  You want to go easy with this one, for what I find to be pretty obvious reasons.  Also, maybe, you know, outside?  Sulfur, yo.  Stinks so bad.\n\n",

All this is blended with gentle floral notes that rest on a base of warm patchouli. Contains Lemon oil and Patchouli oil.\n\nand\n\n> MR TAYLORS\n\n> A fresh fougere accord with herbaceous top notes of lavender, bergamot, green notes resting on a heart with geranium and soft green fern. The base of this fragrance is ambery with cedar, leathery, moss and musky. Contains cedarwood oil, Patchouli oil and Lavandin Grosso.\n\nMr. Taylor's was the first wet shaving product I ever bought, and I thought the smell was fantastic. Light, floral, a bit sweet, just very pleasant to take in every shave day.\n\nI have the Eton College currently, and they are not joking about the dominance of the lemon. As soon as you open the jar you get smacked with lemon and orange zest, but it's not just straight citrus either. The rest of the scent is what I assume to be patchouli, but I've never smelled that in isolation before so I have no idea if I'm right.\n\n----\n\nI have nothing against TOBS products; if someone told me they were literally the only people doing scents like this then I would happily buy only TOBS. Just wanted to know if any of the soap artisans out there have tried similar combinations with success.",

Is this like a mango ice cream accord you're pursuing, or are you trying to make a cohesive fragrance with a creamy peachy core? This knowledge will impact how I read this. In general, it's hard to give non-generic \"feedback\" without hearing your own impressions. For example, I don't know if you like it or not. If you think it's great and you're more interested in sharing a success--then, excellent, and thank you. If you think it's close but it's missing X or has too much Y, then I can better suggest things to add or subtract.\n\nI certainly have some thoughts based solely on theory, but I'd hate to steer you in a bad direction because I didn't have enough background.\n\nAll I can say at this point is that if this is your first accord, then it was an ambitious one. Instead of reinventing the wheel, have you tried one of the many established peach accords and tried \"creaming it up\" from there?\n\n[https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/Images/sds/Key%20Accord%20Formula/peach.pdf](https://shop.perfumersapprentice.com/Images/sds/Key%20Accord%20Formula/peach.pdf)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/comments/1jukius/does\\_anyone\\_have\\_ideas\\_for\\_how\\_to\\_make\\_a\\_nice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/comments/1jukius/does_anyone_have_ideas_for_how_to_make_a_nice/)\n\nCheck out the bottom link in particular. Just 3 months ago, someone asked for help with peach accords because the ones they tried on the internet weren't realistic enough. It looks like they received some fruitful--pun not intended--suggestions.\n\nBest,",

No, the temperature is not a factor neither is the 1% extra superfat. Its that you can not just give the soap a ser amount of time to be ready to cut, it doesnt work that way. Lots of things can influence that, but mostly is a lut the recipe itself, or the additives. Usially the fragrances.

    "body": "Hi! I'm currently trying to find a new cleanser and doing a bit of a shakeup of my skincare routine. I'm not the biggest fan of oil cleansing but I'm liking balms for massage. I think my skin is fairly normal all over, but dehydrated. I try to use cruelty free wherever possible, so preferably stuff that isn't sold in China either (no Clinique or anything). What I'm using...\n\nMornings Liz Earle Cleanse and Polish - I like this, easy to use and cleans my face well, doesn't give me spots of anything BUT my skin always feels a little too tight after using it. (Aqua (water), Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl esters, Cera alba (beeswax), Glycerin, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan stearate, Eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, Humulus lupulus (hops) extract, Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, Anthemis nobilis (chamomile) flower extract, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Benzoic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic acid, Sodium hydroxide, Limonene, Citric acid.)\n\nHydraluron - not feeling a huge difference with using this but I'm trying to finish the tube. My skin does feel softer after using it, not sure about hydration. (Water/Aqua/Eau, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ahnfeltia Concinna Extract, Carbomer, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, PhenoxyethanoL)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising Cream - loving this, my skin feels so much better. (Aqua (Water), Glycerin (Vegetable), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Wheat Straw Glycosides (and) Cetearyl Alcohol, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Seed Oil, Sclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum, Citral, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nEvenings Liz Earle C+P - as above. takes my makeup off nicely\n\nEmma Hardie cleansing balm - not the biggest fan of the smell and I think it's given me a couple of spots (could just be stress/travelling though)? Love the texture, possibly too high in essential oils? Also ridiculously expensive I feel. (Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-8 Beeswax, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Sorbitan Stearate, Palmitic/Stearic Triglycerides, Limonene, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Silica, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Aqua (Water), Lecithin, Linalool, Butylene Glycol, Octyldodecyl PCA, Menthyl PCA, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Disodium Phosphate, Citronellol, Citric Acid, Geraniol, Citral.)\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - skin does feel a lot clearer and spots seem to disappear quicker when I use these. (Water/Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Water, Lactic Acid, Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Fruit Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Phyllanthus Emblica (Indian Gooseberry) Fruit Extract, Polysorbate 20.)\n\nAntipodes Divine Oil - 3 or 4 drops depending on how my skin's feeling, I do notice a difference in my skin when I don't use it. (Persea gratissima (avocado oil), Macadamia ternifolia (macadamia oil), Buxus chinensis (jojoba oil), Rosa canina (rosehip oil), Canaga odorata (ylang ylang oil), Amyris balsamifera (torchwood), Santalum album (sandalwood oil), Jasminum officinale (jasmine oil), Citrus sinensis (orange oil), Tocopherol acetate (vitamin e), Benzyl benzoate+, Benzyl salicylate+, Citronellol+, D-limonene+, Farnesol+, Geraniol+, Isoeugenol+, Linalool+. * Ingredients certified organic by AgriQuality. + Components of essential oils.)\n\nTrilogy Vital Moisturising cream - as above\n\nI want to try The Trilogy night cream (Aqua (water), Sweet almond oil, Cetearyl alcohol, Certified Organic Rosehip Oil , Cetearyl olivate (and) sorbitan olivate, Coco-caprylate, Goji Berry, Rosapene‚Ñ¢, Oat extract, Acai oil, Honey (mel), Aloe vera leaf extract, Evening primrose oil, Marula oil, Avocado oil, Chamomile flower extract, Calendula officinalis flower extract (and) glycine soja (soybean) oil, Cocoa seed butter, Vitamin E, Parfum, Rosemary leaf extract, Citric acid, Dehydroacetic acid (and) benzyl alcohol, Citral, Geraniol, Citronellol, Limonene, Linalool.)\n\nand the MOA green balm (Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cera Alba (Beeswax), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow) Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, CI 75810 (Chlorophyll), Limonene (occurs naturally in tea tree oil)). Thoughts?\n\nAnything wrong with this routine or anything you'd recommend? I want one that's just easy to use, but still does good and smells good too - I just know if something doesn't smell good I won't use it. My skin isn't a fan of Shea butter or anything rose/geranium related (except for rose hip, that seems to make it happy). I also need a new spot treatment, I've got the Clinique one at the moment but obviously don't want to repurchase. Otherwise I just put extra divine oil on which seems to help or witch hazel gel.

Should I throw them away when I'm moving to the new place? \n\n  \nI'm using cedarwood oil spray and moth balls as well as Ortho (I'm living in Canada) but these annoying bugs are still there.

        "body": "So let me settle some of your worries instantly, carpet beetles are in most homes, about 80-90% and they can get in from the outside. The larvae generally stick to edges of walls like the baseboards and stick to void areas and won't rlbe seen crawling on you, the adults they possibly can but they are more attracted to light and try to get outside for pollen and such. They don't bite and some people may have a skin reaction to the shedding but that's it. For cleaning options I'd say you can get a steam cleaner if you'd like that helps break the cycle, keeping clean is important too, but also keep in mind that they can spread throughout the house, so focusing on just one area will only limit them in that specific area, not get rid of them. It's really hard and near impossible to get rid of them completely without professional help from my knowledge. Getting your house sprayed seems to be the best option as it kills all of them inside and leaves a residue that will kill any new comers for a month and a half. But alot of people can't afford or may not be able to do that like myself so honestly just keeping clean and just limiting how much you check and squashing rm whenever you see them seems to be the best way to limit it, even when I went on a clean freak I still see 1-2 pop up In my room here or there every week, sometimes 1 a day sometimes 2 sometimes none, they are very harmless unless you like your carpets they can damage your carpets but that's about it. Otherwise if you don't have a skin reaction to the larvae hairs or shedding they are essentially just icky little creatures. A few things you can use is de food grade that's apparently safe for pets and humans even if consumed, but applying it is dangerous while airborne and can be bad for your lungs so make sure to have some proper safety equipment or a respirator if you are going to apply it, but once it's settled it seems to be fine but lots of people don't recommend it lots do. Apparently like ant traps or moth balls and other stuff works, I'm in Canada too in the US they have nyguard plus don't know if you can manage to get your hands on it but if you can that helps alot. I'd just call up some local pest companies or you can look up some pest stuff online for that just look up carpet beetle spray or whatever and follow the directions, but I have just accepted that even if I do that, there's spots in a house I can't clean, and I can't control my roommate or my upstairs neighbour's to be as perfectly clean and aware of the problem as I am, and most of the time it's just a common amount in your house and not an infestation, if you are worried about an infestation there could be a dead bird or something where, but other than that yeah the adults get in from outside lay eggs then try to leave and die in a couple weeks. The larvae can last a long time though. All in all the larvae won't be crawling on you while you sleep, I've had people say that oh I had shedding in my hair and all that but honestly they either got it from the adult what is very unlikely but technically could be possible but if it's from the larvae it certainly almost 99% of the time will never be ontop of your bed, the larvae are born where the food is that they can eat right away (and no they don't eat your hair while you sleep, people who say that also think they bite lol) the most they might do is go between your boxspring and matrass but I've never seen that. I've seen them on the baseboard at most and at the very least kinda away from the edge of the carpet. Hope this helps.",

Rosemary oil, lavender oil and cedarwood oil mixed with Jojoba oil (Duration: 3months) -  Results: Didn't work\n2. Microneedling, 1mm length, weekly once (Started Microneedling 4 months ago) -                                Results: It did work a little bit...Before and after pics : [https://imgur.com/a/NGu7ggj](https://imgur.com/a/NGu7ggj) \n3. Using Redensyl, Capixyl and Procapil (RCP) serum and Ketoconazole Shampoo from past 1.5 months.\n\nSo, From today I will be starting a new journey by adding 5% Min to this.\n\nMy routine:\n\n1.  Ketoconazole shampoo in the morning.\n2. 1 ml Min in the morning.\n3. Multivitamin tablet (Keraboost) and Fish Oil capsule after lunch. \n4. 1 ml Min at night. \n5. 1 ml RCP serum an hour after applying Min (btw this 1hr gap between Min and RCP is suggested by my Dermatologist). \n6. Microneedle once a week.\n\nI know I know... I'm not taking any anti-androgens...that's because I will get all those side effects just by thinking about it. Researching about Fin is the worst thing I have ever done in my life, I should've just taken it when my dermatologist advised me. \n\nI might sound very very dumb here but I'm actually waiting for pyrilutamideüò∂ I asked my doctor \"How long does Minoxidil work?\" She replied \"4-5 years...after that you should consider taking Fin\" . \n\nWell... if that's true then I can peacefully wait for Pyrilutamide. I will watch everything closely for 1-2 years and I will take decision regarding taking Fin... I might micro dose 0.025 topical Fin which has almost similar DHT reduction in scalp and less Systemic DHT reduction (You can watch \"More Plates More Dates\" vid regarding this)\n\nCurrent Status of my hair: [https://imgur.com/a/3bdoLOY](https://imgur.com/a/3bdoLOY) \n\nI will update everything even if I don't get results. \n\nPlease do comment your opinions below!\n\nThanks.",

Much of their land was neither arable nor easily traversed, and so it was difficult to mobilise people in great numbers or supply them when they could be encouraged to move. Though the reconquest of the fertile plains of Urapivarta remained a priority, attempts had thus far remained unsuccessful; even the hegemons of Adadach could not get together an army large enough to tackle the walled towns - cities, even - of those fertile plains. \n\nAnd so rather than focusing on what could not be done, the Urapi focused on what could: expansion of trade, governance and influence, and maintaining the tradition of kharubbal to keep the mudborn as weak as possible in the hopes that one day they might be cast away from the holy lands entirely.\n\nSome key fruits of success were from Canaan and the Ban'so'garekan: dedicated ***harbours*** and ***levantine trade ships***, which were much more effective at loading, transporting and unloading goods than the otherwise somewhat martial affairs of the Urapi dockside. \n\nIncreased trade meant more people dedicated their time to finding and producing valuable trade goods. For this they turned to the trees, extracting **Cedarwood oil**, and to the seas, obtaining **tyrian purple dye**. \n\nGetting these goods to market was, of course, a necessity and had to be done as cheaply and effectively as possible. Central standardisation on the size of **wheels and axles** and the subsequent **wagons** to fit the width of the roads that they had to go on ensured that a maximal load could be carried on a minimally sized road. \n\nTo better protect increased urban wealth from potentially jealous foreigners, or even their poor mountain dwelling brothers, the city-dwellers meanwhile invested in **defensive gates**. \n\n**Currency** - I'm gonna write a post and link it before the deadline, I just want to throw *this* post up before I go to work.\n\n___\n\n**Urapi Techs**\n\n[**Research post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeofMan/comments/aes5kp/an_age_of_frustration_and_hope/?)\n\n[**Tech sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qxUODa0iuHGkt65NykzSWaHkxNO2Cu53pjvvVpWeMmo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Administrative Focus**\n\n* General techs\n\n * Wheels and axles (**MST**, have Potter's wheel) \n * Wagons (**MST**, have cattle, wheel and axle if approved above)\n\n* Military\n\n * Defensive gates (**MST**, have defensive walls.)\n\n* Administrative Focus\n\n * Currency (*not MST*) [RP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeofMan/comments/aeu51a/the_value_of_nested_seals/?)\n\n* Cultural\n\n * Cedarwood oil (*Not MST*)\n * Tyrian purple dye (**MST**)\n\n* Diffused (From trade partners Canaan/Ban'so'garekan)\n\n * Harbours (**MST**)\n * Levantine trade ships (**MST**, have basic boats, sails, steering oars, plank hulls and caulking) ",

I was silly and I hadn't read the instructions which said it is a biocid and toxic to ingest or inhale. I sprayed 4 times in the cabinet and immediately noticed the strong smell. I also have some old pots and pans in the cabinet. I didn't directly sprayed onto them but I'm still worried if they can be used. Then I opened all windows as well as the cabinet and took most of the pots and pans out. I don't want to bin all these dishes if it isn't necessary, but I don't want to put them in the dishwasher either. What do you recommend?\n\nI also hang up some insect repellant things containing cedar wood oil and they had a really strong smell as well all over the house so I took them down. I'm afraid they are toxic as well. I'm so mad at myself as I have spent so much money on this stuff. Can somebody tell me how to use these stuff safely?",

This meant flattery. This meant *copying*.\n\n**Watermelon** was popular in Egyptian courts... and so it was in Il'Djera, too. Egyptian buildings were known to use **columns** and **lime mortar** and soon Djeran buildings did, too.\n\nAnother interesting development was that of a navy. Briefly, the Egyptians suggested that the Djerai might pay half their annual tribute in timber instead of gold... leading to massive efforts to harvest and transport timber to the coasts. This effort proved unnecessary once the Videti, much better equipped to fulfill Egyptian naval needs, capitulated to them... but the wood was mobilised and available at the coasts, and so was repurposed for the construction of ports and ships.\n\nWith many examples in their waters to copy from, **oarlocks** and **keels** were quickly adopted but... the vessels of war in use did not particularly interest the Djerai, whose enemies were each other and easily accessible via land. Instead they looked to improve their capacity for trade and therefore hoped to improve their **sails** instead of manning rowed ramming vessels.\n___\n\nThe Djerai were ever keen on finding new incenses, hoping to find anything and everything that would enhance their communication with the djeer. **Mastic** did not make a particularly good incense... but it was nice to chew, yielding a sweet flavour after a brief stint of bitterness. \n\n**Cedarwood oil** on the other hand *did* make a good incense, as well as a more conventional perfume to boot, a fact well appreciated by the Djerai when they count down countless cedar on behalf of the Egyptians.  \n\n\n",

        "body": "No, there's no strong scientific evidence behind scalp oiling for hair growth. Adding oils to an already oily area of our body (the scalp) promotes fungal overgrowth, itching, dandruff, and can even cause further hair loss. With the additional essential oils there is a risk of skin irritation as well, although that maybe an individual sensitivity. If it's pretty old, then oils can start to oxidize/go rancid and a rancid oil is more likely to cause skin irritation. I don't see any antioxidant in it to prevent oxidation.¬†\n\n\nThere's also very limited evidence behind dermarolling, and it does have a risk of infection because it's breaking the skin, so you'd need to keep the skin and the roller really clean.¬†\n\n\nHave you spoken with a doctor about the thinning?¬† Health challenges can trigger Telogen Effluvium which is temporary, the hair grows back on its own once the health issue that triggered it has resolved, but it can take 3-6 months before you start to see regrowth. However TE is normally characterized by diffuse thinning, meaning an even distribution of thinning throughout your scalp. If it's thinning just at the temples, it may be a different type of hair loss. If you're able to book an appointment with a dermatologist, I highly recommend doing that soon. If it's not TE, then earlier treatment is likely to result in a better outcome. If it's TE, then the main thing to do is have patience, but thickening shampoos can temporarily make the appearance of the hair look thicker in the meantime. Sometimes TE and a second type of hair loss can happen concurrently.",

I won't lie, after the discoveries of Blanche Immortelle and Citron d'Erable I have been a tad too excited and have actually jumped ahead and smelled a few extras. Yes, I cheated, I'm sorry.\n\nToday we look into a sorta infamous Musc Imperial and the underground Trefle Pur. For those of you new to this review series: I received a few months back a full, 35 piece sample set to Atelier Cologne. This is my first-impression/sampling experiences of ALL 35 scents.\n\n**Musc Imperial**\n\n> ‚ÄúEmotions and places are sometimes inseparable. The evening approaches. Revived by the powerful rays of the sun and the Mediterranean breeze, the city comes to life. The encounter must take place at the top. Excitement is inevitable. The party will be epic.‚Äù \n\nAs usual, the official notes from Atelier Cologne:\n\n*Top*: Calabrian Bergamot, Spanish Sclary Sage, Blackcurrant \\[don't ask me why they spell it \"sclary\"\\]\n\n*Mid*: Lavender from Provence, Fig from Andalusia, Leather Accord\n\n*Base*: Indian Musk Ambrette, Virginian Cedar\n\nI've read that Musc Imperial was created originally for some fancy hotel in Spain as a unisex fragrance they would be complimentary in their bathrooms. Considering that 30ml of this juice runs for $85 USD, it isn't the cheapest fragrance a hotel could sport, but I'd stay if they let me snag free perfume.\n\nThe opening of Musc Imperial starts with a hit of bergamot, classic Atelier here, but it quickly recedes to the background as a dry, musky, herbal note of clary sage takes the lead. The musk ambrette is also present from the beginning keeping the fragrance up to its name (for those of you who do not know, musk ambrette is the seed of a plant whose essence is musky in a way that kinda sorta kinda maybe mimics real deer musk, therefore it is commonly used as an ethical replacement or in accords for replacement of the real thing). The blackcurrant adds a green tangy touch, but it is in no way the front runner to me. This opening is clary sage and musk backed by bergamot, blackurrant, and lavender. It is pretty dry, but not overly so to where it is choking. The backing notes help a lot.\n\nAs Musc Imperial dries, the musk ambrette stays but the clary sage fades into the leather accord. The leather accord's life in the front is short lived, however it is the perfect bridge to the base. A sweet, resinous fig lurks around, coming forward and receding for a long time, taking away from the dryness of the musk, leather, and late clary sage. This is the bulk of the fragrance: dry musk with whiffs of fruity sweetness. It is very pleasant; those of you who like musk will enjoy this one. The musk is rough, not smooth like in Khiel's Original Musk or Jovan. This musk is rugged and almost woody, which very well could be some cedar peeking through. Come to think of it, it does vaguely have a natural cedarwood oil scent dancing around in there behind the scenes.\n\nThe far drydown is about losing the sweetness. Cedar is there, I guess? But it is not prominent. It is all about the ambrette. \n\nSome people claim this is an Aventus clone, to which I  say *screw off*. Not everything is a damn Aventus wannabe! Analyze what is similar: Aventus is an aggressive juicy fruity-woods scent with gourmand, musky, and smoky facets (depending on the damn batch you get); Musc Imperial is a rough and dry musk with woody and fruity facets. Both are flexible on occasions. However, they are not the same. Trying to say these are the same is like trying to say Versace Pour Homme and Acqua di Gio Profumo are identical. VPH is a syntheticly soapy aquatic, AdGP is also an aquatic, but with a screaming patchouli note and incense! Sure, one is based on AdG, the other is a flanker of AdG, but if you smelled the two you would need some radical screws missing in your noggin to claim one is a clone of the other. Similar, yes!--they fall in the same \"genre\" or family of scents. HOWEVER they are nothing alike beyond that. Musc Imperial is musk with a fruitiness throughout. Aventus is woody and fruity with a muskiness throughout, SO WHAT. Both are good fragrances in my opinion. Am I denying that Musc Imperial drew ideas from the success of Aventus? No. I'm saying just ignore the damn fragrantica reviewers who are so bound up in duct tape with Aventus print that they don't know how to smell the difference between Aventus and a landfill anymore and are so stoned on the shit that soon enough Black Afgano is going to be an Aventus Clone, and something of the elegance of Eau de Guerlain is going to magically become inspired by Aventus through a time-travel paradox. \n\nNOW, the two ARE similar enough to which if someone didn't like Aventus I would recommend they try Musc Imperial as a different approach to the style scent. Likewise if someone likes Aventus I would recommend Musc Imperial as well. I'll step off the soapbox now. \n\nLongevity is above par for Atelier, lasting a solid 6-8 hours. I imagine the scent would leave a nice sillage for the majority of the life, and it never really \"trails off\" to skin. It is there, decreasing in power, but then it just drops off the face of the earth. So, you may say \"Eh, 6 to 8 hours aint shit\", but know that those 6-8 it is mostly present. \n\n**NEXT SCENT**\n\n**Trefle Pur**\n\n> ‚ÄúHe had a good feeling about it. That‚Äôs the thing about luck, you feel it or you don‚Äôt. This moment, he felt it. He found the morning‚Äôs rain had left everything looking greener and a bit sharper, like he was seeing it all for the first time, and he headed off with a spring in his step.‚Äù \n\nThis was actually a fragrance that drew me into Atelier. LuckyScent had a sale in the dead of winter where this was on sale for like $45 for 30ml, but I was for once wise and did not blind buy it on the spot. Instead, I ordered this behemoth of a sample pack about a week before they decreased the size from 35 scents to 16 scents. I got lucky.\n\n*Top*: Bitter Orange from Seville, Tunisian Neroli, Guatemalen Cardamom\n\n*Mid*: Egyptian Basil, Indian galbanum, Violet Leaves from Grasse\n\n*Base*: Indonesian Patchouli, Slovenian Oakmoss, Texas Cedarwood\n\nTrefle Pur is a calm scent. It is aggressively green, surrounded by the bite of bitter citruses, but together the scent is calm. Peaceful. Well constructed. Serene. \n\nBut not noteworthy.\n\nIt opens with a burst of citrus, like most Ateliers. Neroli and bitter orange play together for a bitter and kind of piercing opening if it weren't for the greens in the mid to calm things down a bit. \n\nTrefle Pur is nice. It is very green; basil and violet leaf and galbanum combine to make a very leafy scent. This is topped with the bitter orange. I never get any of the base except maybe a tad of oakmoss or a mossy-like something or other. The scent is refreshing, and pure smelling; very natural. It smells like spring. I'd put it in the same line as Green Irish Tweed and Cool Water but sans the aquatic nature. This isn't really \"dewy\" or wet smelling, just green. It actually reminds me of the clover accord from Guerlain's Aqua Allegoria Herba Fresca. \n\nPerformance is on par with Atelier's early creations and citrus heavy scents. I get about 1.5-2 hours and then it drops to skin for another 2. Not phenomenal in the slightest. Projection is strong until the opening burns off and then it will sit closer to sin but I believe it will trail. \n\n**Ratings**\n\nMusc Imperial: 7/10: not my favorite Atelier, but very nice. May get a bottle at some time, and would definitely recommend.\n\nTrefle Pur: 5/10: Very nice and natural, but nothing too fun. If you are in the search for a nice, green, refreshing and clean scent and have the money to dispose for something that doesn't last, go for it. It is very nice, but just doesn't have a wow factor for me.",

    "body": "Hey there, I thought that I would give homemade shampoo a try, as it really seems like fun, (and frugal). I have a couple questions though.\n\n1) I've always read to use castile soap. From what I understand, castille is pretty much just any natural soap without any added in artificial cleaners/detergents. I came across [this](http://www.rockymountainsoap.com/productDetails/1017198/1019833/1000144) bar of soap for free (I got one free from the store, and really liked the smell of it), and was wondering if it would be fine. It doesn't say castile anywhere, but appears to be all-natural, and the ingredients list is pretty Coconut oil, Canola Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Olive Oil, Blue Corn, Kernel Meal, Cedarwood Oil, and Fir Leaf Oil.\n\n2) I've read to grate it, then dissolve it into boiling water, and I've read to grate it, then leave it sit in room temperature water overnight to dissolve it. Does either way make a difference? And what is the optimal ratio of volume of water to weight (or volume) of soap to get a shampoo that isn't too runny to use\n\n3) Lastly, it seems that essential oils are what is added to make it into a conditioning shampoo. Any suggestions on one that would either have a smell that goes well with Cedar, or no smell, or would I be better of just leaving the oil out, especially since it's my first time making it",

Castile soap, by definition, is made from olive oil, but it sounds like the soap you have would work just fine. \n\n2. I think it would dissolve faster in boiling water than in room temperature. I would use just enough water to cover the soap. Then, if it's too thick you can add a little water at a time. Or, if it is too runny, just add some more soap. \n\n3. I think the essential oils add scent rather than conditioning ability, so I think you could leave it out. You could try adding argan oil as a conditioning agent. It's an oil used for nourishing the hair. \n\nGo ahead and experiment- the worst that will happen is you're out a bar of soap. Thanks for posting this, though. My SO travels a lot and brings home tons of those tiny soaps from hotel rooms and we have way more than we need!

        "body": "1. **Concentration of Ingredients**:\n   - **Top Notes**: These are the lighter molecules that evaporate quickly and form the first impression of the fragrance. Some of the key ingredients for top notes include:\n     - Bergamot Calabre EO (0.61g)\n     - Cardamom Guatemala EO (0.10g)\n     - Pamplemousse EO (0.04g)\n     - Linalool (0.15g)\n     - Lavender France EO (0.02g)\n\n   The total weight for these top notes is about 0.92g. This is around 9.2% of the total 10g formula, which is a reasonable proportion for top notes.\n\n2. **Heart Notes**: These ingredients give the fragrance its main character and typically last longer than the top notes. Examples from your formula:\n   - Cyclamen Aldehyde (0.20g)\n   - Coumarin (0.20g)\n   - Cashmeran (0.15g)\n   - Patchouli Iron Free (0.04g)\n   - Nutmeg EO (0.02g)\n\n   These heart notes amount to approximately 0.61g, or 6.1% of the total weight. Typically, heart notes occupy a more significant portion, around 30-40%, so this proportion is on the lower side. If a stronger heart profile is desired, the heart ingredients could be increased.\n\n3. **Base Notes**: These are the heavier, longer-lasting components. They help the fragrance last and often include musk, wood, and resin notes. Your base notes include:\n   - Ambroxan (0.30g)\n   - Iso E Super (3.04g)\n   - Musk Ketone (0.20g)\n   - Bacdanol (0.10g)\n   - Labdanum Abs (0.02g)\n   - Galaxolide Pure (2.02g)\n   - Cedarwood Oil (0.20g)\n   - Vetiver Haiti (0.10g)\n\n   These add up to about 5.98g, or almost 60% of the formula. This heavy reliance on base notes suggests a deep, long-lasting fragrance with significant musk, woody, and amber undertones.\n\n4. **Modifiers & Diluents**:\n   - DPG (1.63g) is used to dilute some of the raw materials, especially essential oils, for balance.\n   - The use of 10% DPG solutions for some ingredients like Cumin EO and Evernyl is common to avoid overpowering certain notes.\n\n5. **Potential Improvements**:\n   - If you want a more prominent heart, you could consider increasing the concentration of heart notes like Cashmeran, Coumarin, or Patchouli.\n   - The top note balance seems adequate, but you could also add a touch more citrus (like increasing Pamplemousse or Bergamot) if you want a more vibrant opening.\n   - The base note dominance ensures longevity, but Iso E Super (3.04g) and Galaxolide (2.02g) may overpower other nuances unless carefully balanced.",

User experiences with any natchy treatments would be great. I know for some folks minox shedding stabilizes, and others it doesn't.

I donno, I might be outside of the window now for that kind of success story, and I just don't want to worry about side effects all the time. I'd rather have a maintenance regime than worry, that's just me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAside from that brief stint, I'm new to treating my hairloss, but a veteran in reading about treatments - the armchair science, trial and error, the shills, debunked theories, the whole 9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't been reading much for a few years, so my knowledge of what the community has to say is outdated. I've been doing some reading and am aware of some newer treatments. This is the regime I had come up with a few years ago and never began, revised a bit. If anyone would like to help me switch it up, that'd be fantastic. Otherwise, just being a conversation piece is cool too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce I actually start, if anybody is interested enough in the thread, I'll do some 6/12 month before & after shots. Without further ado -\n\n1.) An OMG Laser Messiah, 400 diode \"full deal\" - this has it's own instructions from the man himself:\n\n* Enzyme Scalp Peel once a week (at least for 6-10 weeks or so, then once a month after that) to clean out as much as possible from years worth of follicle buildup\n* Emu oil during helmet sessions to keep the lasers from bouncing off my dry scalp & reducing efficacy\n* Polysorbate 80 before showering helps remove sebum and debris from follicles (same as above, less laser bouncing off dead skin cells etc)\n* Niacin/ethyl alcohol - alcohol to help spread niacin, ethyl less harsh than isopropyl - Niacin brings blood to capillaries making laser treatment more effective\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) Dermaroller. I haven't yet done any reading on why I'd want a 0.5 vs a 1.25, which obviously I would do before buying. I am extremely squeamish of blood etc so it will be hard for me, for that reason I'm considering a 0.5. If anyone has any objections I'd love to hear them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing off of Scott Nali's youtube video posted in this community earlier this month, \"The Bald Truth - Dermaroller 3 Month Test and Tutorial\", I was thinking I'd lift his recommended topicals and routine directly. However, with the treatments I had planned to use for the laser helmet, I might be going too aggressively at topicals and sebum reduction risking dryness. Also Scott uses a scalp rinse with cider vinegar, which may reduce the efficacy of the helmet if it dries me out too much, as I mentioned earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have not read much on the science behind using natural DHT blockers topically like Scott is doing, but I understand that the *idea* anyways is to block DHT from the inside and outside if you can, but if you're going \"natural\" to just focus on the outside. It sounds great on paper, last I left off reading about this stuff it wasn't really considered very effective, or very good science, but of course it's more likely to help than harm as far as anyone seems to know and based on my own reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) A Bentonite clay mask. I know that some folks were having issues with their scalps drying out due to not adding enough of the right oils, so in addition to finding out what those are and making sure I add enough, I have a plan to add this \"super secret\" essential oils treatment that I found in a obscure ass post online years ago. it is as follows,\n\n* 1 tablespoon of jojoba oil\n* 3 drops of rosemary oil\n* 3 drops of lavender oil\n* 1 drop of lemon balm (melissa) oil\n* and 1 drop of Atlas cedarwood oil\n\nThis recipe was intended to be used directly on the scalp by itself once a week, then diluted with water for an additional rinse. I reached out to a dermatologist and essential oils expert for a 2nd opinion on this, and she said that it sounds like overkill - that you shouldn't be using essential oils in that quantity that often, that you shouldn't use essential oils on a regular basis for more than 6 months max, and that just the rinse by itself would probably be enough, because the direct application would likely have you seeing diminishing returns anyhow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever I think that it's possible using one \"dose\" of this recipe in just one month's worth of a bentonite clay mask might be about equivalent to a diluted rinse, and especially since the mask would be using an emulsifier (polysorbate 80) AND I'd be microneedling, the delivery of any benefits of these oils to my follicles is covered pat and I'd be worried about even that being overkill. I've read that you have to be very careful and informed with essential oils, so anyone's advice here would be great if anybody is knowledgeable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also read that with essential oils it's important to find the right \"chemotype\", I do not have these memorized for each of the oils I plan to use but seem to remember that it wasn't too difficult to google \"lavender oil best chemotype for skin and hair\". I still have many if not all of these purchased in the right chemotype from a few years ago, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain as mentioned with the other treatments, I'd be worried about drying out my scalp, but I don't really know because as I mentioned I've never actually began any of these treatments, so I don't have a good baseline for how much any of this may dry out my skin. People fighting hair loss at home seem to have forgotten about clay treatments, maybe there's a good reason for that, I don't really know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.)  Nizoral/Non SLS ketoconozole shampoo, and anything else that may be recommended to me here. I was also considering Hair muck or Super Zix II, those are some older treatments that I don't hear too much about anymore so I'm assuming they've kinda fallen by the wayside, which usually in this scene is for good reason. I think even back then nobody really knew if they helped too much or not, so unless someone hands me a glowing recommendation for one of the two I probably won't bite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne last thing is, I wear a hat to work. I know it's making the problem much worse. I don't really know what I can do about that, though, other than to take it off, and I really don't want to do that. If I hadn't been wearing it so constantly all this time, it wouldn't be a big deal to walk in without it one day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe wearing a hat 8 hours out of the day won't be so bad with all these other treatments, especially if I just do a deep cleanse as soon as I'm off of work. But, if anybody has any ideas for some type of topical mask I could do under my hat, that wouldn't be a problem to wear for 8 hours that may provide a buffer from all the oil in the hat or being produced from my skin, that'd be great...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know there are organic protein based masks people use made of eggs and coconut oil and shit, but I mean I'd smell insane so. I donno if I care about that or not to be honest, I have my grievances with them, too, if they smelled like eggs but knocked off the rest of the shit they do on the reg, it'd be a godsend, so. A protein mask might be a good solution to my scalp being dry from other treatments too, who knows. Hopefully someone here does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I could be using work as an opportunity to add on another treatment, that would be perfect, but I don't know of any treatments that could act as a buffer and are meant to be left on the scalp for that long. BTW, I *do* know how funny it is that I'm considering going to work smelling like eggs and coconuts to treat my big bald head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway there it is. I didn't mention timing or frequency of any of these because I don't really have that figured out yet, so anybody got anything to say on that please do. Having typed all this out, I'm kind of realizing that it may be way too much unless I'm doing one or the other every couple days, maybe one once a week and the other two on the same day later that same week. The Niz shampoo doesn't really factor in as that's just a shampoo. Anyway that's really it, thanks everyone!",

Not sure if it's related or coincidence, but I painted this room‚Äîincluding the ceiling‚Äîlast weekend and they only started showing up afterwards.\n\nI THINK they might be biting me also, but hard to tell. I had a mosquito flying around in here for a day or so also. Notably, my dogs show no signs of bites of any kind. They also don't have any bugs (fleas, ticks, etc) in their fur when I examine them and are UTD on preventative.\n\nWondercide's Indoor Pest Control formula for ants, roaches, spiders, and flies works as a quick knockdown to kill them. It's active ingredients are cedarwood oil, SLS, rosemary oil, and sesame oil. In an ideal world, I'd figure out what they are + why they're randomly showing up, and remediate so they go back outside. I don't WANT to be killing them, but I my desire to get them out of my house is greater than my desire to keep them alive.\n\nSuggestions as to what they might be?\n",
