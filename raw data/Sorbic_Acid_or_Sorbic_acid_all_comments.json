    "body": "This is my first time doing a formal DIY complete with preservatives! I just wanted to do this for myself to save some money.\n\nBuying each of these ingredients together on Etsy totals approx. $80, and even though that's less than the price of one teensy bottle of the oil cleanser that they are marketing, it's still a little pricy. I'm wondering if I can cut out more ingredients than I already am while still getting the same effects\n\n\\--\n\nProposed ingredients of my DIY dupe:\n\nAloe juice, watermelon seed oil, grapeseed oil, walnut oil, camellia oil, black seed (cumin) oil, coco betaine, preservative consisting of phenyoxyethanol, sorbic acid, caprylyl glycol.\n\n\\--\n\n Ingredients of original product ( [https://www.oumere.com/products/oil-dissolution-theory](https://www.oumere.com/products/oil-dissolution-theory) ):\n\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice, water, watermelon seed oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil, calendula oil, walnut oil, Camellia Japonica oil, coco betaine, cocaminodopropylamine oxide, phenyoxyethanol, sorbic acid\\*, caprylyl glycol\n\n\\--\n\nHere are my main questions:\n\n1. I know that I ommitted a few ingredients in my Etsy cart, are any of them mistakes to not add?\n2. Are there any ingredients on my purchase list that will not have any significant benefit and I don't have to buy?\n3. What approximate proportions would you recommend per ingredient/type of ingredient?\n4. Are there any trick to making this or can I literally just measure them out and then mix them together in a little glass/plastic jar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a materials science & engineering student w/ lab experience but this DIY beauty stuff is completely new to me! Any recommendations would be super helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you, everyone!",

Maybe use some cheaper oils when starting out so you can get the vibe of how the oil & water phases work together, and then replace with more expensive oils when you're happy with it.\n\nSpeaking of expensive oils... I'd look at other sources than etsy. For oils, maybe Garden of Wisdom, and for the others, I like lotioncrafter and MakingCosmetics.",

        "body": "I have not made a rinse off bi-phase cleanser but I made several of those you apply with cotton disks. 50% is your oil phase, 50% is water phase. Now the challenge: if you want them to separate the polarities must be as different as possible. That’s why isododecane and cyclopentasiloxane are used in the leave on versions (also because they are volatile which isn’t relevant for rinse off). You also want to add some salt to your water phase (improves separation). 1-1.5%. You need surfactants (coco betaine in this case) but if you use too much it will turn into a cloudy emulsion and you won’t get two defined layers. Start experimenting with as little as possible (say 2% ASM) and see whether it rinses off well. Re oils, I would lose all those weird veg oils and go for the mineral oil (unless you want to splurge on squalane which should also work in theory because it’s a hydrocarbon). Another reason not to use veg oils is stability. They are prone to oxidation (except for those full of saturated fats but these are usually solid). So, 50% mineral oil (mystic moments sold on amazon), 1.5% of NaCL or Mg sulfite, 2% of coco betaine (ASM not as supplied), water and preservative. It’s up to you if you want to add aloe and conditioning agents.",

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

My esthetics teachers have recommended cooling flared up rosacea skin (literally, whether with mist or a cold towel) and using soothing water based moisturizers and masks.  They say heavy occlusives can 'trap' the heat and irritation in the tissue if you apply it without cooling it down first.  Im interested if this is possible/viable, according to your research?  I haven't worked with a rosacea client before! \n\nWhat do y'all think?",

I'm probably not the only one who has a dog that likes to lick lotion off of me.  \nXylitol is extremely toxic to dogs and also NOT usually found in lotion.   \nThe alternative to the lotion is a set of essential oils, which includes an orange oil. My vet advised me that some citrus oils weren't great for dogs, either (and citrus oils are really bad for cats, too). I emailed FFF because both choices suck if you have four legged friends. \nEdit: I will post their reply here if/when they respond.\n\n-----\n\nFrom [Anthropologie's page](https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/mer-sea-co-body-cream):  \n\n> Water, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Sea Whip Extract, Tocopherol, Sea Salt, Maris Limus (Sea Silt), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Dicapryl Succinate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Parfum (Fragrance), Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, **Xylitol**, Glyceryl Stearate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic Acid, Alcohol (Denatured), Sorbic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydoacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n-----\nFrom /u/stereofailureohno, on why Xylitol is added: \n\n> Never in a million years would I have expected to see Xylitol in a body lotion!\nOut of curiosity I looked a little more into it, different sites list it as everything from a moisturizer, humectant, thickeners/emulsifiers, to slip agent. Apparently it does have some merit as a skin care ingredient after all?\nAs a dog and cat owner I am very disappointed that I have no 'good' choice out of these items.\n\n\n",

Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing.

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **SKIN SMOOTHENING SERUM - BAKUCHIOL EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Vitus vinifera \\[Grape seed oil\\], Psoralea corylifolia \\[Bakuchiol Extract7%\\], Vitamin E \\[Tocopheryl Acetate\\], Tanacetum annum \\[Tansy Essential Oil\\])\n\n***My experience:*** I had read a lot about Bakuchiol and wanted to give it a try. Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

Not exactly sure exactly which countries sell the ‘Made in China’ version, but Google has confirmed it’s sold in Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe major difference is that the Japanese version contains Tranexamic Acid, Vit C derivative, and Vit E. The ‘Made in China’ version contains Niacinamide, alpha-Arbutin, Vitamin C, and Reservatol. Interestingly, the Japanese version also mentions nano hyaluronic acid while the ‘Made in China’ version does not.\n\nInterestingly, the SEA version that was ‘Made in China’ **did** feature the same ingredients as the Japanese version with TA. The only difference was where it was made (China vs Japan). This was reformulated sometime in 2022 (around June/July/August, if I remember correctly) to the current arbutin and niacinamide version.\n\n# ‘Made in Japan’ Japanese version:\n\n* **Images:**\n\n1.

Skin pH balanced. Low irritation. Free of alcohol, fragrance, colorant and mineral oil.\n\nTRIPLE BRIGHTENING FORMULA\n\nNiacinamide, alpha-Arbutin and Vitamin C reawaken dull skin and even out skin tone for glowing, radiant skin.\n\n2 TYPES OF HYALURONIC ACID\n\nTwo types of Hyaluronic Acid provide intense, long-lasting hydration through every layer of skin.\n\nRESVERATROL\n\nEffective antioxidant from grapes protects skin from damage and keeps it healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ingredients:**\n\nWater,Diglycerin,Niacinamide,Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol,PEG-400,Dipropylene Glycol,PPG-24 Glycereth-24,PEG-6,PEG-32,1,2-Hexanediol, Chlorphenesin,Carbomer,Polysorbate 20,Alpha-Arbutin, Triethanolamine,Styrene/VP Copolymer,Disodium EDTA, Laminaria Japonica Extract,Tocopherol,Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate,3-o-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid,Fucose,Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol,Sorbic Acid,Carnosine, Saccharide Hydrolysate,Maltodextrin\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Concluding thoughts**\n\nThe formulas are very different, making them basically 2 distinct products. I also did some broad research, and it seems like the lotions they sell to worldwide markets are the Japanese version *with* TA.\n\nI’m so curious to know why they reformulated it in their Chinese factory but kept the same formula for their Japanese factory. Would love to hear any thoughts and/or theories!",

Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "I’ve been putting this post off for too long, but it’s 4am and I can’t sleep, so I may as well get ‘er done.\n\n**Background:** I’ve used two full sized bottles of SK-II’s FTE, and I’m about 1/4 of the way through Missha’s! I feel both have been given a fair chance to show their results. I have oily skin with rosacea, and have been using prescription retinoids for a couple months now.\n\n**SK-II Ingredients:** Galactomyces ferment filtrate, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, water, sodium benzoate, methylparaben, sorbic acid.\n\n**SK-II Review:** It’s no surprise that I loved this stuff, seeing as I used up two bottles of it. The texture is lighter than water, and it sinks in in a matter of seconds. My skin legitimately felt healthier, bouncier, and more resilient after continued use. It doesn’t feel hydrating by itself, but after a while I felt as though I didn’t need as much additional hydration as I normally do. I would say my skin looked brighter, but only marginally. There are downsides though—because of the mild exfoliation, I experienced a slight purge the first week of use. I also don’t think it’s compatible with strong retinoids because of its exfoliative properties. After being on adapalene for weeks, I noticed a stinging sensation when I would apply it. Luckily I was towards the very end of the bottle and was able to use it up.\n\n**Missha Ingredients:** Bifida ferment lysate, diethoxyethyl succinate, niacinamide, 1,2 hexanediol, adenosine, water, lecithin, saccharomyces ferment filtrate, potassium sorbate, glycerin, hydrogenated lecithin, acetic acid, water, polyquaternium-51, ceramide NP, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, yeast ferment extract, lactic acid, hordeum vulgare extract, cassia alata leaf extract, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium PCA, butylene glycol, dipropylene glycol.\n\n**Missha Review:** I switched to Missha because I couldn’t justify dropping another $200 on a FTE without at least trying a dupe, and I’m glad I did. If SK-II is lighter than water, Missha is about the same as water. It’s by no means thick or heavy, just not quite as light, and doesn’t sink in as immediately. Besides the texture, the first thing I noticed is that it felt very hydrating. I’m assuming there has to be some degree of exfoliation going on because of the small amount of lactic acid, but it didn’t sting my retinoid treated skin in the least. In fact, it felt very soothing. Even when I ramped up adapalene to tretinoin, there were no bad reactions. My skin doesn’t feel quite as healthy/resilient as it did with SK-II, but despite that it *looks* better. It’s smoother, my redness is noticeably reduced, and overall looks brighter.\n\n**Final comparison/wrap up:** If I’m considering price, Missha is the winner. It accomplishes some pretty impressive things for being less than a 1/4 of the price of SK-II. If price isn’t a consideration, I think it’s less clear cut. SK-II feels higher end on the skin, and I’ll forever miss that healthy skin feeling and subtle luminosity—but again, I don’t think it’s suitable to use with super strength actives like tretinoin, unless you’ve been on it for a long time and are 100% adjusted to it. IMO Missha is better if you’re after immediate hydration, want more soothing action, and prefer to use harsh actives.\n\nI tried to be as thorough as possible, but I did start this at 4am after not sleeping well… so if I need to clarify anything please let me know! As always I love questions, and hope I helped :)",

I’m out of the loop, but I really thought - wow, when did missha sponsor some esports team??!\n\nsecond, I can actually add something on topic. I used to really like the missha one and used it for a good while (easily 4 bottles). but a couple years back they changed the formula again and that made me breakout pretty fast (normal/dry skin). not sure if it was that yeast ferment, but it didn’t really agree with me. I’m still using the night ampoule from the same line. it has been changed twice aswell, but without negative effects for me. \n\nI feel like this duo of fte and ampoule is one of their staples, but by the time (which is a really long time usually) you need to repurchase, there might be a new edition. not sure if that is the case for skII aswell.",

    "body": "I recently purchased 2 bottles of TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner on Amazon.  And as with EVERY AB products on Amazon, you need to make sure the T’s are crossed and the I’s are dotted to confirm they aren’t counterfeit.  So when I initially received the second bottle, I quickly compared the packaging of both and to my surprise, the content on the back of the product, in terms of spacing, the additional UK/EU distribution foot note, and 3 ingredients that were on one box and not the other.  The ingredients were:\n\nsorbic acid\nsodium dodoxynol-40 sulfate\namaranthus caudatus SEED extract (other box didn’t have the word SEED)\n\nI was absolutely positive I went through their Amazon storefront when I purchased them but still weary about the authenticity because it’s Amazon! I asked around and even went to a local store to inquire.  Had a mixed bag of answers on the legitimacy of the products.\n\nSo I messaged TIRTIR directly with my findings, and they said they would circle back when they have the most accurate info.\n\nAnd they responded with a detailed response which I appreciated.\n\n“The two products have the same content, but the difference is how much more detail they explain the content according to U.S. laws and notation that are updated every year. \n\nLet us explain it to you as an example. Composite ingredient A was indicated in 2023, if it exceeded a specific percentage of the ingredients, but in 2024, all the ingredients constituting the ingredients were indicated. Therefore, sorbic acid and sodium dodoxynol-40 sulfate are tiny at 0.004% and 0.03%, which didn't have to indicated, but the latest version will be marked on the surface of the box. The amaranthus caudatus SEED extract is similar case. Previously, the description of the raw materials was covered with a larger part, but now some raw materials are required to explain and indicate where the exactly extraction was made. \n\nHowever, the sulfate free is caused by our confusion, and we deeply apologize for this. As explained above, it should be not appear as sulfate free as we have it in the full ingredient list. Thank you for your understanding and the wrong information is under correction as it needs some time to be reflected on Amazon system. Best regards, TIRTIR”\n\nThis info might come in handy when other AB products labeling might differ in the future. \n\nTLDR: TIRTIR via amazon storefront is indeed 100% authentic.  The difference is in how thoroughly they explain the content based on US laws and yearly updates.",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

Basically any lotions that are manufactured here in the SEA has a different formula now. \n\nI was quite devastated at first as I have been a loyal consumer of the Premium Shirojyun Whitening Rich Lotion for 5 years. After the news got out, I found myself a way to get the ones with the OG formula, since they are still manufactured with the same formula from other countries outside of SEA(mainly china or japan).\n\nThe hada labo Mild Peeling Lotion which used to have a very minimal ingredient, now has a long list of them. It did amazing for my dry dull sensitive skin as the exfoliating ingredients were only a PHA and tranexamic acid. And knowing that they changed the formula is breaking my heart. I also found a post in this sub somewhere saying that this particular lotion(or rather the whole range, im not sure) is only being sold in SEA, which means they do not sell it anywhere else? I hope this is not true. \n\nDoes anyone know a dupe to this? I basically in need a toner with PHA and brightening ingredients. I’m not a fond of BHA since I found it could be a bit too drying on my skin. I will list out the ingredients before and after they changed it for the Mild Peeling Lotion.\n\nbefore: \nWater, Gluconic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Tranexamic Acid, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Metabisulfite, Phenoxyethanol\n\nafter:\nWater, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Fomes Officinalis (Mushroom)\nExtract, Triethanolamine, Salicylic Acid, PEG-12\nDimethicone, Chlorphenesin, Amylopectin, Glycolic Acid, Lactobionic Acid, Hydroxyethy|piperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Dextrin, Xanthan Gum, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Urea, Trehalose, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Serine, Pentylene Glycol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Sodium\nHyaluronate, Hydroxyethy|cellulose, Olea Europaea (Olive)\nLeaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Disodium Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Algin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "Hey there people i started getting obsessed making mayo at home 2.5 years ago because there was no good mayo with olive oil with seasoning options. I made countless amounts of mayo in this time i used garlic, curry powder, basil, hot sauces and everything all at once and i tried to perfect my emulsion. I tried different things to keep it lasting and i want to share some of this self learned intel with you all.\n\n1. One egg is enough to emulsify 100 times of its weight so dont panic if your mayo breakes, let it chill in the fridge for an hour and try again.\n\n2. If you are going for some powdered spices to make a different breed of mayo try to add them after your mayo is all emulsified and not before emulsion.\n\n3. 1 or 2 grams of xantan gum will make your emulsion immortal and you wont see it breaking up after a few days in the fridge.(Use it before emulsion)\n\n4. You can use a store bought sugarless milk powder with sorbic acid added to make your mayo last atleast a week longer in the fridge(I use a tablespoon it doesnt make a taste difference)\n\n5. Always use vinegar its not there for the taste its there to kill bacteria.\n\n6. Add a splash of cold water and mix after its done it will make it shine like a store bought mayo.\n\n7. If your mayo has an oily aftertaste it means the emulsion is not perfect and it will get harden in the fridge like a butter, it wont break but if you dont like the taste try adding more water and seasonings to cover it. \n\ngood luck!",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ₹40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ₹130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ₹250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ₹1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing. DO NOT wish to review even. Total Gimmick. I fell for it. Waste of money. STAY AWAY.***",

        "body": "Ok, for those of you who have never worked in formulating let me tell you how the skincare industry typically works. Vitamins are the cheapest ingredients, not unique, everyone can use them cheaply. They are great and we know they work but many vitamins carry risk of irritation.\n\nBotanical ingredients are a little harder to create but also very cheap. Peptides are the expensive part. Your skin is made from water, oil and protein. \n\nPeptides are chains of amino acids that can work in the skin through receptors on the cell membrane. That are the most high tech ingredients, but they also have almost no risk of irritation but can give huge gains in dermal density and age management. They literally signal the cell to work in different ways. You can have peptides that carry other ingredients. You can have peptides trigger growth factors and stimulate lots of regenerating actions of the skin. \n\n The major laboratory’s that sell peptides to brands (Lipotec in Spain for example) have sales reps that visit brands and most brands are all buying from the same suppliers which is why we see trends.  Research and development of peptides is very expensive but these labs can sell them at cheaper prices because they sell in bulk and push them out to mass market. \n\nAlso most brands use peptides in such low percentages, like 0.05%, because of the cost. It’s on the inci list but not at effective levels.  BR always use peptides at high percentages so you actually get the benefit. The formula is short to increase the % of active ingredient. It’s not coloured water, that’s an insult to the PhD scientists at BR that work to create products that are different and deliver ingredients at meaningful percentages and not fill the formula with silicones and emollients only for sensory value. \n\n Biologique Recherche literally translates to biological research and it was the name of the lab as Biologique Recherche originally functioned as an ingredient lab and formulated blank label products for many brands. Now days Biologique Recherche  still research and develop their own unique peptides, this is expensive and they have a very niche market. This is why there is cost because you are getting unique expertise, they have been at the forefront of peptide research for fifty years. And they use the peptides in insanely high percentages compared to other brands. The peptides in Progeskin were researched and developed for over 5 years and are extremely effective. If you are not incorporating high percentage peptides now you will be doing your future self a disservice.",

Only had to tweak the ingredient amounts:\n\n**Marinade**  \n4 lb. Chicken Breast/Thighs (I use both), cut up TINY (1/4\" pieces, food processor works perfect here)  \n1/2 tsp Citric Acid  \n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce  \n3 Tbsp Taco Seasoning [(I use this](https://www.amazon.com/Birch-Meadow-Spicy-Seasoning-Flavorful/dp/B0CLYW5HDN?crid=J12LC89CN2BT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WH-1lt5hp_Dbq82QFet22a2hAMtGiEkfleWrF2VItZmBGTqnCuoR5UmNQNzLpsSNVKIx1jpFfEJ2cfLmKyccHyfYAF_nYIZ4bEcsGKe9LB_gA6H-xSGWftPfvW04SEaECD0HRiksMmrClbzL2u6Z5sJEDCy1yqt-9YvPk2-3vRWOZgUKCjcRKefqAVHOi6hOSubm1ZDK7fVFp4CG8zAbGyN04DdffzKsAz032YiKBPsUToBqphWU4D_bAh2YIQFAXOQh1cfONsjakx4Cjhq8u3rd9TVrpMAafV-IiBq63AE.byTl0Z2CCgtwQzhnuCaXwoTcMzYbjrTak88bzVC9Lr4&dib_tag=se&keywords=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadows&qid=1731983849&sprefix=taco%2Bseasoning%2Bbirch%2Band%2Bmeadow%2Caps%2C154&sr=8-6&th=1))  \n1 Tbsp Knorr Chicken Bouillon Powder  \n2 tsp Corn Starch  \n1/2 tsp Baking Soda  \n1/4 tsp Garlic Powder  \n1/4 tsp Onion Powder  \n1/4 tsp Cayenne (or Paprika for less heat)  \nDrizzle of Cooking Oil\n\n1. Combine all ingredients (including oil) and let sit in airtight container for up to 24 hours.\n2. When ready to cook, heat a metal pan (wok works perfect here) over medium-high heat until hot (use the [dancing water test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB-SCA1reqE)), coat with a little more oil, then add 1/4 of the chicken (You'll want to cook in four batches to avoid overcrowding).\n3. Smash chicken into an even layer, then set a timer for 4 1/2 minutes. At 2 minutes, flip; after another minute, break up and stir fry until cooked through (should be around when the timer goes off).\n4. Set aside cooked chicken in big bowl, then Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the other batches.\n5. Mix cooked chicken then taste for seasoning (Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Salt, and/or just more Taco Seasoning).\n\nNext is the Secret Sauce, I liked[ this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZWvlYjZu8Y&t):\n\n**Secret Sauce**  \n1/2 Cup Light Mayo  \n1/4 Cup Buttermilk (or powdered buttermilk + milk)  \n1/4 tsp. Fine Salt  \n1/4 tsp. Sugar\n\n1. Whisk all ingredients together and store in an airtight container overnight.\n\nWith your main ingredients ready, all you need now is taco shells (bake in oven)/tortillas (heat on grill), shredded lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, and your favorite taco sauce.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nEdit: Have made this several more times and made some small adjustments to ingredient amounts for more flavor.\n\nEdit2: Actually found an ingredients list for those that want to try and hack their own recipe:\n\n**Grilled Marinated Chicken:**  \nChicken Breast With Rib Meat, And, Boneless Skinless Chicken Thigh Meat, Water, Seasoning (Modified Food Starch, Salt, Garlic Powder, Spices, Dried Whey Protein Concentrate, Onion Powder, Soy Sauce (Naturally Fermented From Wheat And Soybeans), Sugar, Corn Syrup Solids, Maltodextrin, Lime Juice Solids, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavors, Chicken Fat, Dextrose, Hydrolyzed Corn Gluten, Caramel Color, Chicken Broth, Oleoresin Paprika, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Gelatin), Sodium Phosphates\n\n**Secret Sauce:**  \nSoybean Oil, Water, Egg Yolk, Vinegar, Contains Less than 2% of: Modified Food Starch, Salt, Sugar, Buttermilk Solids, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Calcium Disodium EDTA, Lactic Acid",

I tried it and a slightly inconvenient time when  my skin was a bit damaged from hard water, weather change, and overusing a few actives.  I had just finished a moisturizer that I liked (but not loved) and tried a new moisturizer that broke me out, and tried this one.\n\nMy first impression was that it reminded me a bit of the old Aestura Atobarrier cream. It’s a thicker moisturizer but feels like it actually sink in instead of sitting on top. I have a problem the a lot of moisturizers where it feels like it doesn’t work for me. Either it sinks in and I feel dry within an hour or it sits on top of my skin but my skin still feels tight. This cream really impressed me. It doesn’t have any added fragrance but does have rosemary oil in it. I usually don’t like anything scented but I can smell it when it’s on my hand but not once it’s on my face.\n\nAfter using for a few weeks, I do feel like it did a lot to heal my barrier but it also continued my break out. I decided to discontinue use but might try again at a later time. My skin tends to get very reactive so it’s hard for me to say if it’s a product that triggers it or if I am in a particular reactive state. For all the rec for alt for the old formula of Aestura Atobarrier Cream, this is one I have liked the most. I purchased this from Olive Young.",

I recently found one at Walgreens, and thought I'd share:\n\n**1.** **Vanicream** **Moisturizing Skin Cream $8.59 for 4oz**\n\n[https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vanicream-moisturizing-skin-cream/ID=prod6143640-product](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/vanicream-moisturizing-skin-cream/ID=prod6143640-product)\n\n**Ingredients:** Purified Water, Petrolatum, Sorbitol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Simethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-30 Stearate, Sorbic Acid\n\n**Notes:** I am a long time user of Vanicream. It is a basic, no frills moisturizer. I can almost always use it without stinging, even when my skin is irritated. I use it on face and body.\n\n**2.** **Walgreens Sensitive Skin Moisturizing Cream $11.99 for 16oz**\n\n[https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-sensitive-skin-moisturizing-cream-16oz/ID=300431913-product](https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-sensitive-skin-moisturizing-cream-16oz/ID=300431913-product)\n\n**Ingredients:** WATER, PETROLATUM, SORBITOL, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, PEG-100 STEARATE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIMETHICONE, CETEARETH-20, SORBIC ACID, BHT, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLEHXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**Notes:** I think Walgreens nailed it on this one. Same consistency & texture as name brand. Feels the same on skin and seems to last as long as Vanicream. Doesn’t sting face.

Also, even though the label for the Walgreens product states that it is “Fragrance Free” and “Masking Fragrance Free” this product smells like my grandma’s house, kind of like stale flowers. That is because one of these preservative ingredients is actually a fragrance.

It is high porosity and takes hours to dry, even when chin lenght as it is now. The texture is very mixed, with some slightly wavy strands all the way up to kinky curly ones. I'd say most of it falls in category 2B.\n\n\nI have been wearing my hair curly and was getting fantastic results with a product by Rene Furterer, the Veloute Perfecteur de Boucles. It was a light, non greasy cream and I could use a fair amount of it without any adverse effects. Something in it really helps with curl formation, and all I had to do was put it into still rather wet hair, and let it dry. Perfect, consistent results every time. The hair was curly, light, perfectly hydrated.\n\n\nHere is the ingredient list:\n\n\n*Water, ethyhexyl palmitate, cetearyl alcohol, acanthus mollis leaf extract, amodimethicone, BHT, butylparaben, cetearyl glucoside, cetrimonium chloride, disodium EDTA, ethylparaben, fragrance (parfum), inulin lauryl carbamate, isobutylparaben, maltodextrin, methylparaben, persea gratissima (avocado) oil (persea gratissima oil), phenoxyethanol, polyquaternium-37, polyquaternium-68, propylparaben, trideceth-12.*\n\n\nA few months ago, they changed the line. Now the cream feels sticky and heavy, and although it still does promote curl formation (could be the acanthe extract, that is what the brand claims in their marketing), it makes my hair greasy and stringy and really just not nice. So, cue in another product hunt. Lots of money already into it, I'm not getting there... I now need a leave in, a defining curl cream and a gel to get lesser results, and I have to be so careful not to touch my hair under penalty of turning into a frizz ball.\n\n\nHere are the ingredients of the new, totally not improved product:\n\n\n*Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract, Alpha Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, BHT, Butylphenyl, Methylpropional, Ceteareth-33, Citronellol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Parfum), Glycerin, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lactic Acid, Limonene, Linalool, Maltodextrin, Oenothera Biennis, (Evening Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-68, Salicylic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Dissucinate.*\n\n\n**Is there anyone who is knowledgeable enough to take a look at the differences between old and new and maybe shed some light on how I can find another perfect product? My wallet and I thank you in advance.**",

    "body": "During the conference call on November 22nd, Amyris announced that it would begin rolling out albicanyl acetate in 2023 with an F&F partner. It could be Firmenich or DSM/Givaudan.\n\n**FIRMENICH:** \n\nFirmenich is interested in Albicanyl acetate as a precursor to other highly valauble Ambrox derivates. Firmenich holds several patents in the drimane sector among others also a biosynthetic route to albicanyl acetate.\n\n[https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020078871](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020078871)\n\n[Firmenich pathway to albicanyl acetate](https://preview.redd.it/vun931a38b881.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ce9d8b74a26503f5419f261a375f75aa9a681e)\n\nThe problems with this route, however, lie in the details of the intermediate product albicanol, since this is a solid product and is only soluble in organic solvents and this non-aqueous environment is not preferred by yeast. This fact is not conducive to achieving a high yield, if at all possible. I'm curious what other viable route Amyris found here.\n\nBut why should Amyris stop by Albicanyl acetate? \n\nAlbicanyl acetate could be a precursor to much more than only to the F&F sector. \n\nOne example is Polygodial, which is the most valuable component in Tasmanian pepper a drimane-type Sesquiterpene. And Albicanyl acetate is  a precursor to Polygodial which disposes a broad spectrum of biological activities, from antifungal, antimcrobial, anti-inflammotary, antiallergic, analgesic and the most important insect-antifeedant activities.\n\nThe unreliability of wild fruit production is an issue for Tasmanian pepper,  and it is very complex and costy to extract pure Polygodial from the berries of the Tasmanian pepper or water pepper.\n\nThe chemical synthesis of polygodial requires at least eight steps and has not yet been implemented in an economically viable manner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Polygodial](https://preview.redd.it/xdck1z9d8b881.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5f4d56f79f1d3e57fae3d38bd6ef5a6e5a5a8d8)\n\nBut why has Amyris told us to produce Albicanyl acetate and why not the more valuable Polygodial?\n\nPolygodial with it's antifungal properties is toxic to yeast and kills Saccharomyces cerevisiae within ten minutes. So the last step from Albicanyl acetate to Polygodial has to be done by chemical reaction, what not seems to be a problem. This missing last step explains why Amyris only told us about Albicanyl acetate and not Polygodial. \n\nBut together with a partner in chemical synthesis, Amyris could fix that last step. Polygodial has such a wide range of applications that a consortium of partners that covers all possible areas would actually be more conceivable.\n\nBut who could be the other partners for those molecules?\n\n**AGRICULTURE-INDUSTRY**\n\nPolygodial as insect-antifeedant biopesticide could have a bright future in a novel segement in agriculture. Conventional pesticides are contaminating land and earth, and more and more insects are becoming resistant to important pesticides.\n\nInstead of killing the insects with pesticides and causing lateral damage, attempts will be made in the future to make their food inedible by insect-antifeedants like Polygodial.\n\nOne example of another antifeedant is the Neem-extract with the triterpinoid Azadirachtin as active compound.\n\nThe problem is that the Neem extract is a mixture of different components. Many countries do have regulatory hurdles, and do not accept mixtures with unknown or not proofed components.\n\nPolygodial as pure biosynthesised component, biodegredable and renewable could overcome the regulatory hurdles, and could be adopted by the agriculture industry by meeting the farmers big supply demands.\n\nSome examples of the effectiveness of Polygodial:\n\nMaize is one of the major cereal grains and is with 19.5% the world’s highest supplier of calorie for body growth. Inadequate storage structures and insect pest cause significant losses. Maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky) and larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus Horn) are the most important pests of maize. Small-scale farmers are often forced to sell maize shortly after harvest to minimize losses during storage, thereby attract low prices and compromising food security. Chemical pesticides are used widely and have adverse effects on environment and humans. Polygodial was found to be the most repellent compound and exhibited the highest growth inhibition in serveral studies.\n\nThe diamondback moth (*Plutella* *xylostella)* is a world-wide pest of most crucifers and has shown a high ability to develop resistance to almost all groups of insecticides. It was found that Polygodial inhibited the ovipositon by 91%.\n\nPolygodial showed antifeedant activity against the silver leaf whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae, yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and black citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricida) in other studies.\n\nPolygodial is postulated to be the most active antifeedant against the African armyworm. Polygodial killed mosquito larvae and had mosquito repellent activity which is stronger than the commercially available repellent DEET.\n\n**BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES**\n\nAmong the biologically active properties of Polygodial including antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic there are several studies emphasizing the antifungal activity. Moreover, the combination of Polygodial with very weak antifungal compounds including anethole, safrole, methyleugenol, maesanin and sorbic acid enhanced the activity signiﬁcantly, sometimes up to 64-fold.\n\nPolygodial appears to be a substance that multiplies the effects of other compounds.\n\nA study with Tasmanian pepper shows that Polygodial could be a compound to enhance the efficiency in medical cosmetics. The study found that Tasmanian pepper extract can decrease itching and burning sensations between 79% and 58% in as little as five minutes.\n\nThis in turn suggests that Polygodial would be a excellent addition to CBG and Squalane in the Amyris Terasana range.\n\nThis write-up only reflects my thoughts and ideas when I heard from the introduction of Albicanyl acetate by Amyris. For this purpose, in-depth DD and clarifications must now be carried out in order to be able to better assess the possibilities.",

It's also happened to Sulwhasoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask - there's essentially no ginseng in this product anymore (it's shunted wayyyy down in the ingredients list).

Are you asking if there's anything wrong with drinking energy drinks? You're an adult, so I don't think so. One of my nutrition professors says he drinks energy drinks. I'm pursuing a degree in dietetics, and I drink energy drinks. If all you're drinking is 2-3 cans a week, I think it'd be difficult to substantially prove that you're doing your body any harm. If there is evidence of that, I'd like to see the research. :)\n\nI probably have a few cans of the same drink you're talking about in my fridge right now. That's mostly because my dad got me some cans that were on sale at the market. I'll say again, the Rockstar is more than likely not causing you any substantial amounts of damage. I think that a cup of coffee contains a better \"nutrient profile\" than an energy drink, but don't let anyone fool you into thinking that a couple of Rockstars a week is going to shorten your lifespan. If I can level with you, I'd reckon it'd be a lack of exercise that does more harm.",

This one man band is based out of Morenci, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. Every so often, Scott unveils one of his pet projects, in this case, a shaving cream known as Project Sphinx. From what I understand, this is a limited edition and future release is not definite. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/), Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/) and The Stray Whisker ([https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/](https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlbizia is designed to invoke the feeling of walking through a dew covered field in the early morning of the vernal equinox. The scent is a blend of light floral, bright green notes and a creamy note. The results of this combination offer a bright, fresh smelling scent. The scent is unique, but familiar. This is a floral fougere scent to my nose that is very approachable. Mrs. Ruds was neutral on the scent, which is a plus given her narrow “approved list”. Strength of scent is mid, both form the soap tub and once lathered up. A scent with a similar vibe from wet shaving would be Mammoth Soaps Sonder.\n\n \n\nAlbizia is offered in the (currently) limited edition Declaration Grooming cream, known as Project Sphinx. Ingredients include:  Stearic Acid, Water, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Bison Tallow, Fragrance, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol. This cream is firmer than many creams I’ve used, but still softer than a soap or croap. The cream is very thirsty and rewards its user with a dense lather that resembles marshmallow fluff when dialed in. This cream really reminds me of the Declaration Grooming bison soap base, without the stringy loading stage (not that I ever minded that). The slickness of this cream is excellent, both in terms of primary and residual slickness. It’s a touch shy of elite, but man is it close. Post shave stands out as well. Most creams provide little to no post shave. This offering however provides post shave in spades. I find it excellent when compared to any soap, not cream only. Given the experiences I’ve had with this cream and the metric discussed, Declaration Grooming’s Project Sphinx receives a ShaveScore of 94. For similar performing soap bases, I recommend Australian Private Reserve and Noble Otter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Albizia (purchased)\n* Brush - ​Mocek “Emperor’s Stone” (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Gamechanger .84 (purchased)\n* Post - Stirling Soap Co.

I realized it contained alcohol and have since switched to Lait U. I did enjoy Lait VIP o2 but I don’t believe in using products with alcohol for extended periods of time so that’s why I decided to switch and Lait U is very gentle. \n\n- I was recommend complexe iribiol for pimples I get from time to time. Yes, it clears it up very quickly, but the second ingredient is alcohol denat and I would get rough patches on my skin if I used it multiple days in a row. \n\n- I do love Masque Vivant although it also contains denatured alcohol. Since I only use it about 3 times a week for about 30 min I have decided it’s of low risk to my skin since the alcohol is a little bit lower on the list. \n\n- Masque vip o2 does seem to make the skin around my eyes a little brighter but I have a pimple right near my eye that won’t seem to go away. After looking at the ingredient list and seeing mink oil as the 5th ingredient it makes sense since mink oil is very comedogenic. \n\n- I love lotion MC 110 N*1, and since I doesn’t contain any alcohol I will continue to use. It really plumps my skin and gives me a glow. It is meant to be used after your P50 lotion (toner). \n\n- I was recommended P50 PIGM400 for my skin and it does lighten my skin and make it feel super balanced. After looking at the ingredients though, it also contains denatured alcohol and therefore after I finish this bottle I will move on to the regular P50 (without phenol) since it doesn’t contain alcohol. \n\n- The placenta serum is probably my favorite. It hydrates and heals my skin and I also use it on my eyes during the day. \n\n- The PIGM400 serum is just ok. It also contains alcohol and I feel like my other products have lightened my dark spots from recents acne more than this serum. It also contains some ingredients that can cause acne. \n\n- Creme Dermopurifiante makes my skin glow when I use it and it does great with skin that is acne prone but it also contains alcohol so for me, using it long term is a no go. \n\n\n\n",

Then add, in parts, while stirring:\n\n* Water, demineralised – 54\n\nThat’s all there is to it!\n\nI ordered the materials above from Jojoli.nl  or Hekserij.nl (Netherlands) and made this simple formula multiple times already, with no hassles. The INCI names between \\[ \\] can help you find suitable replacements locally.\n\nThe Rewoderm/Hexaderm is essentially the moisturizer. You can play around with the percentage according to how nourishing you want the soap to be. \n\nIf you find the soap is too liquid, you can add some more Lactic Acid but know that the soap will still firm up a bit in the first 24 hours. If too viscous, add water in small increments.\n\nThe 1% perfume concentration is typical for soaps. The perfume concentrate you're adding, should **not contain any ethanol**. DPG is a suitable solvent. \n\nAlso check whether each RM in your perfume formula is stable in liquid soap (most are). [Perfumersworld.com](http://Perfumersworld.com) is a good resource for checking. \n\nIf so inclined, also check the IFRA limits for **category 9**.\n\nThis is the only soap recipe I have made so far, so an expert I am not.

One contains, among others, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, which is said to increase the efficacy of niacinamide, whereas the other version contains MSM and antioxidants.\n\nHere are the ingredient lists:\n\n**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**:\nWater, Niacinamide (10% Vitamin B3), N-Acetyl Glucosamine (Amino Acid Sugar), Butylene Glycol (Humectant), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Cocoyl Honeyate (Honey Derived Ingredient), Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Allantoin (Anti-irritant), Xanthan Gum (Food-Grade Texturizer), Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (Antimicrobial), Caprylyl Glycol (Humectant), Sorbic Acid (Food-Grade Preservative), Phenoxyethanol (Preservative)\n\n**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide & MSM Serum**:\nWater, Niacinamide (Vitamin B3), Dimethyl Sulfone (MSM), Butylene Glycol (Humectant), Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Ferulic Acid (Antioxidant), Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Allantoin (Anti-irritant), Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant-Derived Amino Acid), Caprylyl Glycol (Humectant), Ethylhexylglycerin (Preservative)\n\n\nBoth are said to have a \"light-as-water\" texture. I wish the version with antioxidants contained N-Acetyl Glucosamine too....Now I don't know which one to order.\n\nWhich one would you choose?\n\n\n\nEDIT: I checked the delivery costs and they are $15 for Europe.... In that case The Ordinary still wins. But they have free domestic shipping above $10 for the US.",

I would def go with the first serum.\n\nPros of Serum #1: Assuming you're seeking the \"traditional\" benefits of Niacinamide use (improved uneven texture/tone, hyperpigmentation, excess sebum production, enlarged pores/acne damage), this one will do it much better. Combining Niacinamide with NA-G greatly potentiates the effects of one another- powerhouse combo. Looking at some of the other actives in the formula (Panthenol for anti-acne skin conditioning, licorice root for redness, Willow bark for anti-microbial/inflammation, Cocoyl Honeyate for sebum suppression) it sounds like this is a clear winner.\n\nSerum #2: Contains MSM which is a skin penetration enhancing agent. Normally good, but considering Niacinamide's ease of penetration and the fact that MSM is a \"cheaper\" less potent skin PE (compared to like Dimethyl Iso. etc) there's no real benefit IMO. Especially since both formulas contain Butylene Glycol (solvent/penetration enhancing agent). Aside from Ferulic Acid (which is basically irrelevant w/o any L-Asc. Acid or Tocopherol) I don't see any antioxidant advantage to this serum. FA is normally used as a UV/light stabilizer for more volatile antioxidants, which this serum contains none of.\n\nBoth look great, but Serum 1 clear winner in my books.",

Declaration (formerly known as L&L Grooming and Declaration Brushworks) is well known for their range of shaving soap, aftershave care and hand tied premium badger knots and hand turned brush handles. The company has not rested at all, even through their move from Georgia to Michigan. Aside from purchasing direct, their software is also available through Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/). \n\nBandwagon is Declaration’s nod to the classic and very common barbershop genre of scent. The scent is an interpretation of Declaration’s trips to the local barber with their grandfather. The scent is a musky, powdery accord that is supported by creamy sandalwood. The scent notes are listed as: Bergamot, Musk, Sandalwood, Lavender, Camphor, Coumarin, Tarragon and Anise. The scent for me, opens powdery and creamy before some muskiness comes into play. This is a masculine barbershop that is unique enough to buy, no matter how many barbershop scents you own. The scent strength is light to mid, by design actually. Scents with some similarity are: Wholly Kaw Man From Mayfair and Reef Point Soaps Command Presence. \n\nDeclaration’s soap base is among the very best performing soap bases on the market. Some have trouble dialing in the lather because it simply loves to be drowned with water. The results when dialed in though stand in the rare air of greatness though. Excellence in all metrics. \"Yogurty\" dense cushion, hella slickness and residual slickness and spa like moisturizing post shave is what you can expect. With an ingredients like this (Stearic Acid, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Seed Butter, Castor Oil, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid,) its no wonder. The Shavescore for this soap base comes in at 95. Similar soap bases in terms of performance are: Wholly Kaw (donkey milk) and Catie’s Bubbles (luxury soap).  \n  \n---  \n\n\n\n ****Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, \nsponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.* \n \n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Bandwagon sample (purchased)  \n\n* Brush - 3rd TSM Custom brush (purchased)\n\n* Razor -  Worcester Razor Co. “Special” (traded for) \n\n* Post - Chatillon Lux ​Santal Auster (purchased)",

It does lean heavily on the peach fragrance. Not overly sweet or feminine but definitely not a masculine scent either. It's one of those scents that sits right there in the middle and serves its purpose. Which is to take to you a place and time, away from your reality. While I like it, I could stand to have a more prominent ocean note. For example, leaving a jar of B&M's Oceana open while shaving with this really helped take me to that oceanside back porch, sipping my sweet tea. \n\n**PERFORMANCE**    \nThe L&L Grooming Bison Tallow base is the star of the show here. I've been waiting to get my hands on a tub of L&L for months and it does not disappoint in terms of performance. Lather whips up easily into a thick, dense foam that makes you feel like you're cutting butter with a hot knife. Seriously, I know YMMV, but L&L provides me with the best overall feeling of cushion and glide... I love this stuff. \n\nThe menthol here is also very subtle and doesn't hit you right away. It's a nice touch, as it gives you a nice post-shave cooling sensation.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**    \nBeing my first full tub of L&L Grooming, I've come away with a minor disappointment in their tubs. The labels and design aesthetic are killer, some of the best in the game but their tubs leave a bit to be desired for me. Owning only a handful of soaps (B&M, Reef Point, Phoenix & Beau, Henri et Victoria and TOBS) the feel of these clear, softer plastic tubs doesn't sit well with the price of L&L soaps. At $4.50/oz plus shipping, killer label design and seen as one of the nicer artisan soaps, I expected a nicer tub. \n\nAt the end of the day though, it's not a deal breaker. That just comes down to personal expectations versus reality. If you live in the south or you enjoy vacations on the gulf... get this stuff. It's great. \n\n**EDIT** Formatting cleanup",

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

Redness all over the scalp, scales and dandruff snowing off my head constantly and ithching feeling like ants crawling on my head... This all while using ketoconazole 2 % (formula similar to nizoral) 2-4 Times a week. \n\n By accident my barber used a tonic containing piroctone olamine and climbazole which significantly reduced the flare up after one application. I then purchased a shampoo called Sachajuan scalp shampoo (possibly only available in sweden?) and after two application and some stress management it all went away by 80%. I personally believe piroctone olamine, climbazole and Lactic/salicylic acid are the main ingredients that helps and possibly menthol that had a cooling effect during a flare up. Since then (2018) I have been alternating with the shampoo and nizoral every shower and had have one flare up since then not even close to the first one.

Their prices are very affordable and they sell glitter gels, eyeshadows, lip glosses, perfumes (with glitter and stuff inside!), skincare, and a couple of other products. I purchased two [glitter gels](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/wicked-glitter-gels) in [highlighter topper shades](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/biodegradable-eco-friendly-highlighter-toppers) \"Strawberry Milk\" and \"Lucky\". It cost me about $12 including shipping, and I received everything in early October (which I expected. Her TAT was as posted.)\n\nThey came in small containers, with **four** (!!) free friends in other shades. I'm not sure which shades I got as freebies, but one of them is a neon pink and orange chunkier shade that I've already worn several times, one is a bluer toned shimmer, and two are warmer soft pinks.\n\nThe [highlighter topper version](https://hauntinghowlbeauty.bigcartel.com/category/biodegradable-eco-friendly-highlighter-toppers) is preferable to me, since I ordered these to use as eyeshadows. The other versions contain non-eye-safe glitter, but the highlighter topper version is glitter-free, which I love! The gels themselves are aloe vera-based, which I really like. I direct messaged them asking for the ingredients of the eye gels since I couldn’t find them, and I was told: “ALOE LEAF JUICE, VEGETABLE GLYCERIN, CARBOMER, SEA KELP EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, JOJOBA OIL, APRICOT SEED OIL, VITAMIN E OIL, POLYSORBATE 20, SORBIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, AQUA, PHENOXYTTHANOL, MARSHMALLOW ROOT EXTRACT”.\n\nThey take a sec to dry down, but once they are dry they are very comfortable to wear. I have not tested layering them with other kinds of shadows, but as a one-shadow look, they are very beautiful and dimensional, and they last for HOURS. They are also easily removable with water, which is MAGICAL to me.\n\nAdditionally, a little goes a long way. I thought the containers were kind of small, but I've used one shade four or five times, and I still haven't even dented the amount that's stuck to the inside of the lid! I will definitely get my money's worth!!\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend their gels, and I plan to try their pressed cosmetics and perfumes next. I see they also have a solid black lip gloss that looks very interesting! Their TAT is currently 1-8 weeks, so I don't expect anything I order to arrive anytime soon, but I don't mind that personally.\n\nHas anyone else tried this brand? What do you guys think?",

I have really been looking forward to sharing my thoughts on this product along with Then I Met You’s The Giving Essence (review coming soon for that one). So, here we go!  \n \n\nTo be honest, I wasn’t really thinking I’d purchase this toner or the essence. When they came out I was full-on into my “must buy only natural/organic products that I can buy locally” phase. But, as I started to see some poor results from the products I was using I decided to come back to my K-Beauty roots LOL! This toner and essence duo from Then I Met You was my first purchase after making that decision.\n\nThis toner is a super lightweight/watery product that features Birch Juice, Marshmallow Root, Squalane, Glycolic Acid, and Lactic Acid. Shea Butter, Rose Flower Water, Olive Oil, and Wintergreen Leaf Extract all make it into the formula as well.\n\nFor those that are interested…this is a cruelty free product that is packaged in a soy printed box. The bottle itself is glass…but it is painted so I think recycling may be an issue here. For me, I love the aesthetic of this bottle/box so I’ll probably rinse it and hold on to it for some “vanity candy” LOL! \n\nI have to say, I was pretty impressed with this product from the first use. Considering the Shea Butter, Olive Oil, and Squalane…I was really expecting a heavier product. This toner is just so thin and easily absorbed it kind of blew my mind. In my head I was thinking I would be left with a residue or heaviness like I did with the Laneige Cream Skin (review coming soon as well LOL) but this was totally different.\n\nThere is no added fragrance here or essential oils…so there really isn’t a “scent” exactly. But, the Glycolic and Lactic Acids come through for a slightly “acidic” scent I suppose. It reminded me a lot of some of the Dermalogica or Murad acid products I have used in the past. A very clinical/basic scent that I kind of like.\n\nEven though there is Glycolic and Lactic Acid in the formula…the concentration is 1%. So, this is a product that can be used in place of your normal daily/hydrating toner. For me, I used it both AM and PM and applied 2 layers each time. Either applying this one to a cotton pad and swiping or just patting it in will work fine. Because “actives” like the ones used here are pH sensitive…I gave this product just a couple of minutes alone before moving onto my essence. There is some debate on how essential a “wait time” is for things like AHA/BHA/Vitamin C for them to be effective (or maybe more accurately how long that wait time should be). Personally its a habit to wait at this point so I tend to do it naturally.\n\nOver the past month with the Birch Milk Refining Toner and I have to say I am a fan! My skin has been looking more hydrated/dewy and remaining that way longer into the day. I have totally cut out hydrating mists (for now) but my skin doesn’t seem to be thirsty for that extra hydration throughout the day. I think Then I Met You has performed some kind of magic by incorporating heavier emollients into such an incredibly light/watery toner.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of things that keep me from making this a “must have” pick. \n\nThe low level of AHA here is totally fine for daily maintenance and super mild exfoliation…but cant really be relied on as the only means of exfoliation (at least for me). I decided to remove any other AHA products from my routine to see what this toner could do. And, it wasn’t much LOL! My blemishes/mild breakouts weren’t phased by this toner and I did see a bit of increased congestion around my cheeks and nose. My combination/oily/sebum-filled skin does need something a bit more intense from time to time (unfortunately). Or, I can get by with incorporating several “low-acid” products into my routine at once…so maybe a BHA cleanser, AHA toner, and a mild AHA/BHA wash-off mask. Alone, the Birch Milk Refining Toner just didn’t have what it takes. \n\nFor those with more normal skin or who are mildly dry/flaky…this could be a much better option for exfoliation. Especially if other products with higher percentages of AHA have been too intense for you. This isn’t a bad/ineffective acid toner…it was just a little too mild for me to totally rely on it. As a compliment to a weekly AHA/BHA mask or something like that…perfection LOL!\n\nAaaaand…we have to talk about the price. It is another reason I don’t think I could make this a consistent purchase. This product comes in at $32.00 USD for 100ml. Compared to some of my other favorite acid toners from Peach & Lily and Moon Juice…its actually the least expensive option. But, because I didn’t see the exfoliating benefit I see in those other products I’d rather pay a bit more. As for the hydration aspect, there are just sooo many other excellent hydrating toners for far less. My favorite from last year was the Aromatica Rosemary Refresh Toner (now the Vitalizing Rosemary Decoction Toner) can be found for around the same price…but you get 300ml. \n\nI love Then I Met You…its philosophy, brand story, and founder Charlotte Cho are simply amazing. She is kind of the reason I decided to start writing reviews and sharing my thoughts on K-Beauty. I will continue to try their products at least once LOL but I don’t think I will be coming back to this toner. \n\nHowever, if you have struggled to find an acid toner that is gentle enough for your skin this is a must try. Also, if you have used the Laneige Cream Skin or other toners that include oil/emollient ingredients and found them to be way too heavy or greasy…this might be your new holy grail! \n\n\\*\\*\\*Note: The Peach & Lily The Good Acids Toner I mentioned above actually has a lower percentage of AHA. But, it includes BHA as well and somehow I find that product to be more effective at resurfacing and exfoliating. Sometime formulation is just as important as sheer percentages. It’s another awesome product for sensitive skin!\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/775b06vhhgq41.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39cf3a62b99e9d23496ccc62d1cdba4320e9f087\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nBetula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Gluconolactone, Water, Sodium Lactate,Trehalose,Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Dodoxynol-40 Sulfate, Sorbic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nWhere To Buy (Then I Met You Site - $32.00 USD):\n\n[https://thenimetyou.com/products/birch-milk-refining-toner](https://thenimetyou.com/products/birch-milk-refining-toner)",

    "body": "[The Shave in Question](http://imgur.com/ECps06a)\n\n*Hermes Trismegistus.* The de facto author of the Hermes Corpus. \n\nIt is only fitting that this soap be named after the man, as the soap pays tribute to Terre d'Hermes. Earthy, woody, vetiver, citrusy but... sweet? This scent is just layer upon layer of pure masculinity. \n\nIts been a while but lets break it down by the usual categories...\n\n**Packaging:** The soap arrives in a nice solid ivory white jar. Sturdy with nice ridging on the sides of the handle to grip when opening and closing (especially when this stuff gets on your hands and its too slick to handle anything) The label is simple and matches the color of the jar with nicely typefaced font. Lets call it a **8/10**. Personally I dont care about the packaging in this case because the score is separate from the rest of the soap categories.\n\n________________________________\n\n**Scent:** \n\n>Terre d’Hermès is a symbolic narrative revolving around a raw material and its metamorphosis. A novel that expresses the alchemical power of the elements. A water somewhere between the earth and the sky. A journey imbued with strength and poetry. Woody, vegetal, mineral.*\n\n- *Hermes*\n\nTop Notes: Grapefruit and Orange\n\nMid Notes: Gunflint, Flint, Peppers, Pink peppercorn, Geranium leaves, Patchouli, Baies rose\n\nBase Notes: Atlas cedarwood, Vetiver, Gum benzoin\n\nUpon first scent, i smell it like this... Chocolate, vetiver, florals, ceder, citrus. The chocolate is undoubtably the combination of the Benzoin and Patchouli. Really pleasant on the nose but also extremely aggressive. Masculine. Dirty. then Floral, definitely the geranium comes through.\n\n**9.6/10**\n__________________________\n**Performance**\n\nThe single most important category. Scent is great because it gives me a reason to use the soap, but if the soap cant perform to my expectations, it goes back on the market..\n\n*Ingredients: Stearic Acid, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Avocado Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Seed Butter, Castor Oil, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid*\n_______________________\n\nThoughts: \n\nThe soap is VERY soft in the jar. Certainly it is a croap. It loads heavy on the brush with 2 swirls. It needs to be drowned in a gallon of water over the course of 5 minutes, but if done gradually, you are rewarded with what is, without a doubt, the best lather on the market. I am a huge B&M fanatic, and the glissant base is astounding, but I feel as though this soap has outperformed. It is so dense. Almost like syrup on the face. Shiny enough you can see your reflection. Insane slickness. I feel like i could fit a square peg in a round hole if you greased that thing up with this stuff. Cushion right on par with the top tier stuff, and the post shave which is the most comfortable my face has ever felt after running a blade across it. Just super nourished and comfortable. I used Fine Snake bite as a control toner as to not interfere with the soaps scent or post shave. \n\n**10/10**\n\n_______________\n\n\nAggregate score: **9.8/10**\n\n\n______________________\n\n\n**Bottom Line**: If you have not gotten your hands on this soap base from L&L you are doing yourself a disservice. Whatever you are wetshaving for, whether it be to keep a tight budget, or to shave for the ritual of it, you need to have one of these soaps in your den. \n\nAs for this soap, it is not a main production piece. Very small batch run, but I plead with them, PLEASE make this a regular piece in the lineup. It is impeccable. A staple in my den.\n\n",

I managed to go up to nightly use in two months and had absolutely zero peeling or purging – just the usual, occasional hormonal spot here and there. My derm then suggested we move up to 0.05%, but the price tag made my eyes water (around ~£120). I then found Menarini online for ~£13; I'd read good things about gel vs cream, and I didn't need a prescription to order it. So, I took the plunge. \n\nI think it's the worst thing I've ever done for my skin. I went in carefully, sandwiching once every three days. Suddenly, I broke out all over my chin, around my mouth and along my jawline. Super painful cystic acne, with spots coming up in clusters of two or three - never just one. My skin didn't *feel* irritated but it clearly was, so I simplified my routine even further and completely stopped using my SA cleanser. \n\nI thought I was just mid purge, so I tried to persevere, but after 3 weeks I just felt constantly sore and depressed so I got back in touch with the derm and explained. He said he's not familiar with Menarini but that there might be something in the formulation that my skin doesn't agree with - but he didn't say what. He advised I take a break completely and contact him again once my skin has calmed down/cleared. I'm now on day 5 with no tret. I haven't had any new acne, and my existing breakouts are calming super quickly. \n\nI'm going to follow his advice and get back in touch when my skin feels ready, but I want to do some homework before I take the hit on paying so much for Obagi. So I'm curious - what could my skin be reacting poorly to in the Menarini? I'm not clued-up on ingredients at all but so many people in this sub are incredibly knowledgeable, so I thought it was worth a shot. I found the ingredients lists for both, and have copied and pasted them below:\n\nMenarini 0.05% gel\n\nActive Ingredients tretinoin gel USP – 0.05% Excipients: PEG-4 olivat, PEG-7 olive oil ethers, methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, propylene glycol, silicone oil, caprylic / capric triglyceride, carbomer, triethanolamine, purified water.\n\n---\n\nObagi 0.025%\n\nEach gram contains: Tretinoin 0.025%, stearic acid, isopropyl myristate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum, sorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene, and purified water.",

Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly.

I can also use original flavour because that's in abundance since nobody drinks it. Any help will do, thank you for reading.",

You can use the salt for developing the negatives (It took 2 days so 48 hours at room temperature. Increasing temperature will increase development time). The stop was just a splash of normal food grade vinegar. Then for the fix was ammonium thiosulfate. The results were just as good as my usual rodinal/water/adofix routine. But obviously developing using photo chems takes 30 minutes vs homebrew 48 hours.  \n\nPossibly something went wrong but I don't reccomend doing anything other than just buying a litre of rodinal, 100ml of adofix and just go with it.   \n\nFor your question, I imagine the other ingredients in the monster mix will destroy your negatives. I'm just wondering how you're going to get rid of the sugar residue that's going to stick to your negatives. Wash untill it's gone?

    "body": "Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum\n\nI’ve been using the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum for just about a month now and boy has it been a ride.\n\nFirst things first, this is a very unique and interesting product. Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly. Plus, my skin was just lacking that bounce and feeling of deeper hydration (with no other changes to my routine).\n\nSo it seems that this product really does deliver on its promises. My skin has really seen an almost immediate improvement since working the First Care Activating Serum into my routine. But, I still don’t know if I would come back to it. I feel like if I started working in a really nice first treatment essence packed with fermented ingredients (and a bit of alcohol) I might see a similar result...and could probably find something much more affordable per oz.\n\nFor now, I’ll probably finish my bottle up and move back to other more “typical” serums that I have in my stash.

The emulsifier I have available are: Polysorbate (20,60,80), Emulsifying wax (NF,BP),BTMS-50,Olivem 1000. That means imo,  that fluid oil cleanser is not doable ( if anyone has suggestions please let me know)\n\nSo, I am going to be using the list of [this](https://www.earthrhythm.com/collections/cleansing-balms/products/healing-cleansing-balm-with-propolis) that washes off well as my guide:\n\nCetearyl Olivate (and) Sorbitan Olivate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Diheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic, Ricinus communis (Castor) Seed Oil , Propolis Extract, Stearic Acid, Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Water (aqua), Benzyl Alcohol (and) Salicylic Acid (and) Glycerin (and) Sorbic Acid & Grapefruit & Lemon Oil\n\nSo what I deduced from the list:\nCetearyl Olivate (and) Sorbitan Olivate = Olivem 1000\n\nDiheptyl Succinate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic = LuxGlide N350(natural Dimethicone alternative)\n\nBenzyl Alcohol (and) Salicylic Acid (and) Glycerin (and) Sorbic Acid = Preservative\n\nMy plan is to formulate without any of the extracts and Dimethicone so: Olivem 1000, Sunflower and Castor oil, Stearic acid, Tocopherol and Liquid Germall.\n\nI haven't worked out the percentages yet  but I am thinking 15% Olivem 1000 should work maybe?\nAlso do you'll think leaving out the Dimethicone is a good idea? I am leaving out the extracts because I don't think they do much in a wash-off product, but if there are any ingredients that do work, I am open trying it out.\n\nIn the end all I want is an oil cleanser that completly washes off. I have seen so many cleansing balm recipes that call for using a muslin cloth to remove the oil and I hate the idea of washing so many cloths(I am lazy, sue me!) \n\nSorry for the long post:-)",

The commenters recommend replacing the total percentage of polawax/polysorbate 80 with olivem 1000, so 11%, if you wanted to do that. Maybe this post will help you decide on your percentages as well.\n\nThe dimethicone is probably unnecessary, just there to increase spreadability, and I would agree that extracts probably aren't on the skin long enough in a wash off product to have any real benfit.\n\n(Also I want to add I really appreciate the amount of detail in your post and the research you've already put into it!)",

I really like the Oat So Simple moisturizer that Krave makes but I already have the Great Barrier Relief in my daily regimen and I felt like I could probably find a cheaper alternative since my budget is “whatever my estranged husband will give me because I am completely financially dependent on him” level. I tried Cerave in the big tub but it was really thick and never fully absorbed into my skin along with pilling bc it doesn’t layer well. I found a very old thread about lightweight moisturizers and went with one suggestion which was VaniCream for sensitive skin. I like this moisturizer and it works well but I’m not sure about the ingredients (listed at the top). Am I overthinking this because we’ve become too obsessed with our skin care having useful ingredients that we recognize or is this moisturizer an example of what we used to blindly put on our skin but now we know better and should avoid?",

The addition of L-Cysteine is also very odd, and raises some alarm bells in my head related to my current line of thinking on trying to nail down optimal (for me, anyway) protein quantity and amino acid profile.  Suffice it to say, [excess cysteine doesn't look so good for SCD1.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999932/)  There's also a bunch of other fillers, gums, and other junk in there that I try to avoid as much as possible.\n\nThat being said, if that's all a bit too OCD for you, the fat profile seems decent from a TCD perspective, so it probably won't kill you if it's only a once a week thing like you say.

He shows me on his mac the pictures, and on those pictures my hairline looked fine, he then said \"See here and here, your hairline is receding\". He then said he'll give me a recipe for something/tell me what to take, he gave me a paper prescribing a hair lotion called \"Lotion revolotion evdermia\". He told me to rub it at the edges/sides of my hairline for three months and then he told me to go back to him. Dude was smiling the whole while and when he was given 30 bucks (a 20 and a 10) he was all happy and smiley and said \"oh, you've given me change\".\n\nI checked the lotion on the company's website and I don't think it's for hair regrowth. The ingredients are these:  **Aqua (Water), Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Azelaic Acid, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Niacinamide, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract, Allantoin, Parfum (Fragrance), Potassium Sorbate, Carbomer, Sorbic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Biotin, Methionine, Tryptophan, Cysteine, Potassium Hydroxide, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7.**\n\nAnd the lotions actions are these: \n\n* **Toning and hydration of the hair and the hair follicle**\n* **Protection against split ends and hair breakage**\n* **Deep hydration and shine**\n* **Anti-aging**\n* **Non-oily texture**\n\nOverall it was weird.",

    "body": "Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum\n\nI’ve been using the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum for just about a month now and boy has it been a ride.\n\nFirst things first, this is a very unique and interesting product. Even though it is called a serum...it is to be used at the start of your routine just after cleansing and actives. So, it really is more like a first essence in serum form.\n\nThis lightweight/jelly-like serum features mondo grass, licorice root, honey, walnut seed, lotus, and green tea...as well as other herbal extracts for a formulation that covers a lot of bases. Brightening, soothing, balancing, and antioxidant benefits can all be found here.\n\nAlcohol makes it pretty high on the ingredients list which surprised me initially. But, it makes sense because the main purpose of this serum is to facilitate the absorption of other products in your routine. \n\nMy first few applications of this product left me quite impressed. The Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum absorbs beautifully into the skin without any stickiness or residue. I typically used three pumps of product to gently pat into my skin. Although the alcohol scent is pretty apparent...there is a bit of sweet/hanbang fragrance that comes through.\n\nAfter use I noticed that my skin was looking more bright/illuminated and had a more bouncy look as well. Honestly, I felt like my skin was as close to that “dewy/honey-skin” look than it has ever been before.\n\nHaving said that...I really did not want this to be some kind of placebo or my mind trying to justify the rather high cost of this product. So, after three weeks I pulled the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum from my routine to see if there would be a difference. It only took a couple of days for me to notice that my layers of toner weren’t sinking in as quickly. Plus, my skin was just lacking that bounce and feeling of deeper hydration (with no other changes to my routine).\n\nSo it seems that this product really does deliver on its promises. My skin has really seen an almost immediate improvement since working the First Care Activating Serum into my routine. But, I still don’t know if I would come back to it. I feel like if I started working in a really nice first treatment essence packed with fermented ingredients (and a bit of alcohol) I might see a similar result...and could probably find something much more affordable per oz.\n\nFor now, I’ll probably finish my bottle up and move back to other more “typical” serums that I have in my stash. If I do end up missing the benefits that I found in the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum...you may see it pop back up in my routine next year.\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water / Aqua / Eau, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol, Glycerin, Betaine, Peg/Ppg-17/6 Copolymer, Glyceryl Polyme-Thacrylate, Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Peg-60 Hyd-Rogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Tromethamine, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract, Fragrance / Parfum, Honey / Mel / Miel, Juglans Regia (Walnut) Seed Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Dextrin, Lilium Candidum Bulb Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Rehmannia Glutinosa Root Extract, Polygonatum Officinale Rhizome/Root Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Lim-Onene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium Edta, Phenyl Trimethicone, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan), Linalool, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Natto Gum, Citronellol, Citral, Propylene Glycol, Geraniol, Chlor-Phenesin, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Bht, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, Tocopherol\n\nWhere To Buy (Sephora - $84.00 USD - 60ml): [https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product](https://www.sephora.com/product/first-care-activating-serum-P448915?skuId=2291102&icid2=products%20grid:p448915:product) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a62myzhoi3x51.jpg?width=3232&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3979ebe68a1de952d3d4007ecc1140f55c08662",

For those filters, an SPF is not to be specified. \nSPF products also have to protect skin from burning and therefore have to contain high amounts of UVB filters.\nAn anti-aging product focuses on the prevention of photoaging and thus contains mainly a UVA filter.\nAll Day All Year won’t protect you from burning, but it will prevent photoaging.”*\n\nNow let’s have a look at the **ingredients list**:\n\n​- Water/​ Eau (Aqua)\n- Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate\n- Squalane\n- Cetearyl Alcohol\n- Corylus Avellana (Hazel) Seed Oil\n- Isopropyl Palmitate\n- Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter\n- Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane\n- Butylene Glycol\n- Potassium Cetyl Phosphate\n- Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\n- Tocopherol\n- Hydrolyzed Sesame Extract\n- Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract\n- Adenosine, ​Salix Alba (Willow) Leaf Extract\n- Juniperus Communis Fruit Oil\n- Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil\n- Thymus Mastichina Flower Oil\n- Polysilicone-14\n- Cetearyl Glucoside\n- Dimethicone\n- Hydrogenated Soybean Oil\n- Hydroxyethyl Acrylate /​ Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer\n- Ceteareth-33\n- Disodium Edta\n- Xanthan Gum\n- Sodium Hydroxide\n- Pentylene Glycol\n- Citric Acid\n- Polysorbate 60\n- Sorbitan Isostearate\n- Ethylhexylglycerin\n- Phenoxyethanol\n- Sorbic Acid\n\nI see a UVB filter in second place on the ingredients list, and Avobenzone a bit further down (8th position).\nHow is it not possible (or not adequate?) to state the SPF / PA / PPD of this product?\n\nFellow INCI-Nerds, can you please help me make sense out of that?\n\nThank you!",

Beet Shield doesn't use have and SPF in the US, as it  uses Asian/Euro filters that are not approved in the US but that works. In Asia it's SPF 50++++.  This won't work though. This has avobenzone and octinoxate. Octinoxate destabilizes avobenzone (not stable to begin with). You want to stabilize it. Encapsulating might protect them from interacting but not stabilize the avo. \n\nAlso all the essential oils are potentially irritating.  For the price it's really garbage.

I have really been looking forward to sharing my thoughts on this product along with Then I Met You’s The Giving Essence (review coming soon for that one). So, here we go!  \n \n\nTo be honest, I wasn’t really thinking I’d purchase this toner or the essence. When they came out I was full-on into my “must buy only natural/organic products that I can buy locally” phase. But, as I started to see some poor results from the products I was using I decided to come back to my K-Beauty roots LOL! This toner and essence duo from Then I Met You was my first purchase after making that decision.\n\nThis toner is a super lightweight/watery product that features Birch Juice, Marshmallow Root, Squalane, Glycolic Acid, and Lactic Acid. Shea Butter, Rose Flower Water, Olive Oil, and Wintergreen Leaf Extract all make it into the formula as well.\n\nFor those that are interested…this is a cruelty free product that is packaged in a soy printed box. The bottle itself is glass…but it is painted so I think recycling may be an issue here. For me, I love the aesthetic of this bottle/box so I’ll probably rinse it and hold on to it for some “vanity candy” LOL! \n\nI have to say, I was pretty impressed with this product from the first use. Considering the Shea Butter, Olive Oil, and Squalane…I was really expecting a heavier product. This toner is just so thin and easily absorbed it kind of blew my mind. In my head I was thinking I would be left with a residue or heaviness like I did with the Laneige Cream Skin (review coming soon as well LOL) but this was totally different.\n\nThere is no added fragrance here or essential oils…so there really isn’t a “scent” exactly. But, the Glycolic and Lactic Acids come through for a slightly “acidic” scent I suppose. It reminded me a lot of some of the Dermalogica or Murad acid products I have used in the past. A very clinical/basic scent that I kind of like.\n\nEven though there is Glycolic and Lactic Acid in the formula…the concentration is 1%. So, this is a product that can be used in place of your normal daily/hydrating toner. For me, I used it both AM and PM and applied 2 layers each time. Either applying this one to a cotton pad and swiping or just patting it in will work fine. Because “actives” like the ones used here are pH sensitive…I gave this product just a couple of minutes alone before moving onto my essence. There is some debate on how essential a “wait time” is for things like AHA/BHA/Vitamin C for them to be effective (or maybe more accurately how long that wait time should be). Personally its a habit to wait at this point so I tend to do it naturally.\n\nOver the past month with the Birch Milk Refining Toner and I have to say I am a fan! My skin has been looking more hydrated/dewy and remaining that way longer into the day. I have totally cut out hydrating mists (for now) but my skin doesn’t seem to be thirsty for that extra hydration throughout the day. I think Then I Met You has performed some kind of magic by incorporating heavier emollients into such an incredibly light/watery toner.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of things that keep me from making this a “must have” pick. \n\nThe low level of AHA here is totally fine for daily maintenance and super mild exfoliation…but cant really be relied on as the only means of exfoliation (at least for me). I decided to remove any other AHA products from my routine to see what this toner could do. And, it wasn’t much LOL! My blemishes/mild breakouts weren’t phased by this toner and I did see a bit of increased congestion around my cheeks and nose. My combination/oily/sebum-filled skin does need something a bit more intense from time to time (unfortunately). Or, I can get by with incorporating several “low-acid” products into my routine at once…so maybe a BHA cleanser, AHA toner, and a mild AHA/BHA wash-off mask. Alone, the Birch Milk Refining Toner just didn’t have what it takes. \n\nFor those with more normal skin or who are mildly dry/flaky…this could be a much better option for exfoliation. Especially if other products with higher percentages of AHA have been too intense for you. This isn’t a bad/ineffective acid toner…it was just a little too mild for me to totally rely on it. As a compliment to a weekly AHA/BHA mask or something like that…perfection LOL!\n\nAaaaand…we have to talk about the price. It is another reason I don’t think I could make this a consistent purchase. This product comes in at $32.00 USD for 100ml. Compared to some of my other favorite acid toners from Peach & Lily and Moon Juice…its actually the least expensive option. But, because I didn’t see the exfoliating benefit I see in those other products I’d rather pay a bit more. As for the hydration aspect, there are just sooo many other excellent hydrating toners for far less. My favorite from last year was the Aromatica Rosemary Refresh Toner (now the Vitalizing Rosemary Decoction Toner) can be found for around the same price…but you get 300ml. \n\nI love Then I Met You…its philosophy, brand story, and founder Charlotte Cho are simply amazing. She is kind of the reason I decided to start writing reviews and sharing my thoughts on K-Beauty. I will continue to try their products at least once LOL but I don’t think I will be coming back to this toner. \n\nHowever, if you have struggled to find an acid toner that is gentle enough for your skin this is a must try. Also, if you have used the Laneige Cream Skin or other toners that include oil/emollient ingredients and found them to be way too heavy or greasy…this might be your new holy grail! \n\n\\*\\*\\*Note: The Peach & Lily The Good Acids Toner I mentioned above actually has a lower percentage of AHA. But, it includes BHA as well and somehow I find that product to be more effective at resurfacing and exfoliating. Sometime formulation is just as important as sheer percentages. It’s another awesome product for sensitive skin!\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9ai20i7hgq41.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ea5332a218ea6d7422b3175c0dcc0e00205ba23\n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nBetula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract, Gluconolactone, Water, Sodium Lactate,Trehalose,Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Dodoxynol-40 Sulfate, Sorbic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\nWhere To Buy (Then I Met You Site - $32.00 USD):\n\n[https://thenimetyou.com/products/birch-milk-refining-toner](https://thenimetyou.com/products/birch-milk-refining-toner)",

I didn't really need it, but since autumn is coming, I thought it might turn out to be useful when the temperatures drop. I played with different oils and emulsifiers, calculating the fatty acid ratios and HLB as thoroughly as I could, but I haven't come up with a perfect recipe yet. I put it aside for a while and then, guess what - I messed up my moisture barrier with acids. Nothing too severe, but I got a bunch of closed comedones all over my face and my skin burned whatever I put on it.  \nThat's when I took out the remaining ceramide complex and made the quickest possible serum, using the maximum recommended percentage of ceramide complex and a hyaluronic acid/chamomile hydrosol stock that I had in the fridge. I didn't feel like playing much with the oils and emulsifiers, so I just mix a dollop of that simple serum with 2-3 of one of preferred carrier oil in my hand. I didn't add any extra preservative, because both ingredients already had some preservative in. I also keep the serum in the fridge and I planned to use it up very fast (after two weeks I'm almost done with it). I've been using it for two weeks now and it's been working like a dream! It sinks in really fast and it healed my skin in no time.  \nI thought I'd share it here, because it's so simple and effective that it could be perfect for those who'd like to try some DIY but are overwhelmed by complicated recipes.  \n**The recipe**:\n\n* 85% HA stock (98% hydrosol, 1% HA, 1% optiphen plus - mix these three ingredients in a bottle and let the HA hydrate overnight)  \n* 15% ceramide complex (SK-influx V)  \n\nMix well, put in a dropper bottle and enjoy!\n\nYou could also use a ready-made 1% HA solution, I would then add a preservative of choice:  \n\n\n* 84% HA\n* 15% ceramide complex\n* 1% preservative  \n\n\nWith the chamomile hydrosol I ended up having the following concentration of ingredients:  \n\nIngredient | %\n---|---\nChamomile hydrosol | 83,30\nWater | 13,03\nSodium Lauroyl Lactylate | 1,50\nHyaluronic acid | 0,85\nPhenoxyethanol | 0,44\nCaprylyl Glycol | 0,36\nCeramide 3 | 0,08\nCeramide 3 B | 0,08\nCeramide 6 II | 0,08\nPhytosphingosine | 0,08\nCholesterol | 0,08\nSorbic Acid | 0,05\nCarbomer | 0,05\nXanthan Gum | 0,05\nCeramide 1 | 0,0002  \n\n**How to use:**\nMix a small dollop of the serum with 2-3 drops of preferred carrier oil and put on your face in the serum step of your skincare routine.  \n**Please note:**  \nI'm not a chemist, I've been making serums and creams for couple of months now, but I'm still learning. Any feedback would be appreciated. Just like with any other skincare product, always patch test!",

You can see it on the top tortilla of the image on the box. Unfortunately, they've become increasingly difficult to track this kit down locally or even online. Old el paso has made these kits for at least like 20 years, with the same cheese sauce, so it's not some fad product or something.\n\nMy family and I are more than capable of recreating this (and have) without the cheese sauce, but unfortunately when we have we realized it's really that sauce that makes the whole meal worth it. So I'm just hoping since this is a huge mega-corporation (General Mills owns Old El Paso) that the sauce isn't solely for this kit and can be found elsewhere in another product or even bought wholesale.\n\nI have already tried the \"creamy queso sauce\" from ol el paso in the squeeze bottle, it's not a match and is unfortunately very different taste and texture wise. The actual sauce is much closer in texture to Velveeta and even comes in the same type of foil packet in the box, though this cheese sauce has some (few) pieces of red chili/peppers in it? The parent company is general mills not Kraft Heinz, so I don't think they're actually ordering in \"mexican\" flavor velveeta from kraft just for these kits... I could be wrong of course, but the flavor isn't an exact match for Velveeta either.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nEdit: Adding that I've found the ingredients list, which may help rule out potential candidates without having to taste test each one. This is from the online listing for the product on the old el paso site..... And yes, I realize I shouldn't be eating like half of these things:\n\n\"Cheese Sauce: Water, Canola and/or Soybean Oil, Whey, Cheddar Cheese (milk, cultures, salt, enzymes), Corn Syrup Solids, Maltodextrin, Sodium Phosphate, Natural Flavor, Salt. Contains 2% or less of: Buttermilk, Jalapeno Pepper, Red Bell Pepper, Green Bell Pepper, Sodium Alginate, Cultured Nonfat Milk, Chili Powder, Lactic Acid, Color Added (annatto and paprika extract), Mono and Diglycerides, Tomato Powder, Spice, Garlic Powder, Xanthan Gum, Sorbic Acid (preservative), Onion Powder, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Guanylate, Cream, Enzyme Modified Cheddar Cheese (milk, cultures, salt, enzymes).\"\n\nEdit2:  \nUsing ChatGPT and the ingredients list, I was able to identify that the exact same sauce seems to be used in the \"Stacked Queso Crunch Kit\" from old el paso. I've ordered them to confirm but am confident this is likely the same sauce. If anyone can find where to buy the sauce isolated, that's still the holy grail of this search.",

You should really try to keep this natural pH intact as too high of a pH messes up the bacterial flora in your skin and your skin is generally healthier at this pH. From the same source:\n\n> **It is demonstrated that skin with pH values below 5.0 is in a better condition than skin with pH values above 5.0**, as shown by measuring the biophysical parameters of barrier function, moisturization and scaling. The effect of pH on adhesion of resident skin microflora was also assessed; an acid skin pH (4-4.5) keeps the resident bacterial flora attached to the skin, whereas an alkaline pH (8-9) promotes the dispersal from the skin.\n\nObviously, the best way to test for pH is through pH strips. However, there are certain preservatives that can only work in a tiny window of pH at which point they are useless. One of them is Sodium Benzoate. It's only very effective at pH of 3-5 so if your product contains it as an ingredient, your product's pH is likely in that range. It is usually combined with Potassium Sorbate which is also pH dependent (most effective at 3-5 as well so it's also a good ingredient to look out for).\n\nBy the way, Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate are the salt forms of Benzoic acid and Sorbic acid. They are very similar - analogous to Hyaluronic acid and Sodium Hyaluronate so what I said here also applies to the two ingredients.",

If you reductively state that everything is perfect, you fail to understand that being out of sync with the Tao results in war, disconnection, familial discontent, and injustice.*  *Additionally, there's a very real danger, when one claims that everything is inherently perfect, to ignore the very real and immediate issues that face humanity. It allows us to opt out, rather than recognising when things are unbalanced and in need of adjustment.\"* \n\nand\n\n>*Taoists therefore are entreated to obey the Earth. The Earth respects Heaven, Heaven abides by the Tao, and the Tao follows the natural course of everything. Humans should help everything grow according to its own way.*   \n \n\nSome seem to grab the \"All is Dao\" phrase off the shelf as a \"bailout\" or misunderstanding of practicing Taoism, Wu Wei and aligning with the Tao.

Balance.\n\n\"Everything is Taoist\" is true, in a sense.\n\nTo a \"City Taoist\" the Twinkie is probably more \"natural\" in some ways. Perhaps you live in a \"food dessert\" and getting a Twinkie is more \"natural\" than getting an apple.\n\nJust like \"Everything is natural\" is true in a sense as everything is a product if nature BUT we have definitions and language doesn't work exactly like that.\n\nWhen you say an apple is more \"natural\" what you're saying is that an apple exists in this place called \"nature\". Apples grow on trees and Twinkies don't.\n\nAnyhow… what makes \"everything Taoist\" isn't that everything is Taoist. Everything has the potentially to be \"Taoist\" from an individual's experience with life.\n\nAs an outside observer, a lot of the things a child soldier does would be considered \"not Taoist\" but, for the child soldier experiencing life, there are things he must do for survival. If he's fortunate he will get exposed to \"the way\" and start making changes based on new understandings and experiences.\n\nPerhaps he totally escapes that old life to become a pacifist and works to end the use of child soldiers.\n\nIn my opinion anyone who gets exposed to the way and makes a genuine effort to learn and grow from it was Taoist the day they were born.\n\nI'm going to sound corny for a moment but… \"the Tao\" meets you where you are and acts as a companion on your journey.\n\n\"Everything is the Tao\" is a phase and, during that phase, it's true. Then you might end up at everything is not Tao. Then you might end up back at everything is Tao but with nuance that didn't exist originally…\n\nI'm gonna stop rambling there. :)\n\nAlso, I don't think it's fair to say \"An apple is made up of apple,\" unless it's OK to say \"a Twinkie is made up of Twinkie.\" 😂 They're both \"manufactured\". Nature's just mastered the manufacturing process to a level we humans haven't caught up with yet. lol",

Any object that exists is by necessity aligned with the Dao, because it would not exist otherwise. Dao is eternal, omnipresent and is *precondition* to *any* existence.\n\n>An Apple is made up of: apple. \n\nA fruit of a tree species from [*Malus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus) genus consists of *thousands upon thousands* of plant cells of several different kinds with their biochemical make-up so complex, that if written here it will make Twinkie look like puny \"water with some additives\".\n\n>*The Tao Te Ching and other Taoist  works make it clear that some behaviors are aligned with or in sync with  the Tao, and others are not.* \n\nTrue. But the difference between the ones that are aligned with the Dao and the ones that are not is this: aligned ones *have the intended results*. That's all.\n\n>*being out of sync with the Tao results in war, disconnection, familial discontent, and injustice* \n\nIf your goal is to provoke war (for whatever reason), then if your actions result in said war just as you intended them to - those were pretty much \"in sync\" with \"the Tao of provoking war\". Same goes for \"*disconnection, familial discontent, and injustice*\" - if you are aiming at it and you are getting it and you are not getting something you were not intending to get - you are fine.\n\n>*Taoists therefore are entreated to obey the Earth.* \n\nTaoists are not \"*entreated\"* to anything per se. Obeying the Earth is just the most sensible thing to do.\n\n>*Humans should help everything grow according to its own way.* \n\nAgain, Taoism imposes no obligations, moral or otherwise. If you want something to grow certain way - the *sensible* thing to do is to find a method of your actions that would be conductive to this something growing this way as follows from the nature of said something.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

I've had mixed luck actually preventing restarted fermentation using the normal K-Meta + K-Sorb in session meads. I was reading through [this whitepaper](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/wine/files/page/files/sorbicacid1.pdf) and [this study](https://books.google.com/books?id=tNSL7evYkOUC&pg=PA275&lpg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=false), and it seems like K-Sorb is basically useless in the realm of session meads, as the higher pH of session mead (generally speaking) prevents sorbic acid disassociation, and the amount needed to have any antimicrobial action for something with alcohol below 10% is well above the sensory threshold. The whitepaper also seems to suggest that K-Sorb shouldn't be used in wine that hasn't been clarified, which is somewhat annoying considering any honey addition will likely add some haze back into the clarified product. \n\nSo my question is: how do people stabilize their session meads before backsweetening? Should I be looking into some form of sterile filtration? I have a buon vino mini, but I'm a bit concerned at how challenging it'd be to filter all the way down to the sterile pads (and even then, those are nominally sterile, since it's a depth filter). Would clarifying with something like Kieselsol + Chitosan and \\_then\\_ filtering do the trick? That just seems like a lot of work for a session mead...",

I’m also only letting them sit maybe a week after backsweetening before kegging and keeping them cold. \n\nOne thought I have is that I’m often adding acid at kegging for flavor purposes but maybe that could go in earlier.",

This was in Perth, Australia if that helps at all. In hospital I really struggled with the meals they served me, and after a few days I just couldn't do it anymore. Every meal smelled and tasted EXACTLY the same no matter the ingredients, it was a very distinct, specific flavour that drove me crazy. I stopped eating for a few days and was starving to death, even when the other person in my room was served meals, the smell from across the room made me want to throw up. Eventually a family member rescued me and brought me canteen food every day, and I was so happy to eat some decent food again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI thought I had left this terrible smell and taste behind me, never to be experienced again, but I'm currently on a business trip in Saudi Arabia and it's following me around! First, the meals on the plane had the EXACT same taste and smell that I remember from the hospital, and I again started to feel sick.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen when I got to my hotel, I ordered a chicken burger from room service and the bread REAKED of this smell, so I just ate the chicken by itself which seemed fine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday, I bought a spinach and cheese sort-of-pretzel thing from a coffee shop and again, it has that same smell and taste. This one wasn't so overpowering and I managed to eat it, begrudgingly. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat is going on here? I can't find any information about this online, and I've run out of search terms and people in my life to ask. I honestly am starting to feel like it's me, like there's something wrong with me, I'm sensitive to a certain chemical or it could be psychosomatic...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCould it be Formaldehyde? Sorbic acid? Potassium sorbate? Pentadiene? BHT or BHA? I wish I could describe the smell, but it honestly is so unique, it's hard to compare to anything. \"Rotten gravy\" is the best description I can come up with, but it really doesn't do it justice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf anyone has ANY ideas or information, or just a suggestion about where else or who else to ask, please tell me!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit: Just for more context, in Australia a few times a year I will buy a TV dinner, frozen or refrigerated, and while they can be kind of gross, I have never encountered this specific smell and taste with them. Hospital and airplane meals seem to be the main culprits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit 2: Question answered! Thankyou to /u/chineseboofay for figuring out that the common factor was food reheated in plastic. So i have a sensitivity to food reheated in certain plastics, but also /u/coffeeismydoc correctly pointed out that it's probably also related to my experience of being injured in hospital. So while I do find the smell and taste gross, it's amplified by the triggered memory of being trapped in a bed and having no agency or independence, and also going through pretty bad pain from nerve damage.",

    "body": "I'm not terribly unhappy with my skin at the moment, but I get more pimples that I would like - especially on my chin - and the pores on my nose are either blackheads or quite noticeable. I don't have a routine, and never have, and think that having some idea would help! I usually try and avoid parabens and SLS. I went to my local chemist today, and these are the two cleansers (are they cleansers? I think they are) that I came up with:   \n  \n- Clearasil Daily Clear 'Vitamins & Extracts Daily Wash'.   Pomegranate, Vitamin E, Antioxidants, and Avocado. \n     *Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Bentonite, Kaolin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Glucoside, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Arcylate Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Sulphate, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Salicylate, Persea Gratissima Leaf Extract, Punica Grsnatum Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, Sorbic Acid, CI77891, CI42090, CI 19140*  It also says not to apply it around the eye area.   \n  \n- Goat Moisturising Body Wash  \n*Aqua, Goat Milk, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Xanthin Gum, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium sorbate, Citric acid*\n   \nAny thoughts or opinions on them?  \n  \nAt the moment, I use an ego QV tub of Repair Dry Skin Cream. I've had it for about ten years (wow! That's a bit disconcerting, really), and it doesn't have the ingredients on it. Just:   \n*Glycerol 10% w/w, light liquid paraffin 10% w/w, soft white paraffin 5% w/w* and *Methyl hydrobenzoate 0.2% w/w, dichlorobenzyl alcohol 0.1% w/w* and *Perfume free, lanolin free, propylene glycol free, pH6*  \n  \nI use T.N. Dickinson's Witch Hazel as a toner, although it is 14% alcohol.   \n\nUsually I just clean my face with my hands and water in the shower, follow that with either air drying, or a rub with the towel, then witch hazel, then the moisturiser. \n  \nFor sunscreen, I use either Olay Complete Defence daily UV moisturising lotion 30+, or the black Banana Boat 30+. I don't think you can get more than 30+ in Australia.   \n\nI'm a 23 year old girl, and I think my skin tends towards being dry while my chin and nose are a bit oilier. I don't wear make-up very often, if that makes a difference. And my budget is a bit limited. \n\nThanks!",

I'm not sure why the Clearasil one contains clays... that would be typically to be oil-absorbing.  It might be slightly drying, but you could try it.  The goat wash actually looks great.  I'd use that on my face any time.  \n\nThe Repair Dry Skin Cream looks pretty good .  - but the % of product doesn't add up to 100% so I'm not sure what else is in there.  But it's a lot of glycerin,  mineral oil and wax, essentially.  \n\nSome people find that chemical sunscreens are mroe comedogenic than physical sunscreens - I know that I do.  So that might also be something to think about.\n\nUsing some AHA would probably be nice as well - it's really helped my skin be smoother, softer, more uniform in color and way less clog-prone.",

(White Willow) Bark Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbic Acid\n\n**SCENT**    \nPeaches, Sweet Tea, Ocean\n\nAfter using a couple L&L samples (After the Rain and Bandwagon) and upon reading their scent description, I couldn't resist this seasonal release and bought it the day it came out. \n\nOverall the scent is pretty subtle, about a 4/10. It does lean heavily on the peach fragrance. Not overly sweet or feminine but definitely not a masculine scent either. It's one of those scents that sits right there in the middle and serves its purpose. Which is to take to you a place and time, away from your reality. While I like it, I could stand to have a more prominent ocean note. For example, leaving a jar of B&M's Oceana open while shaving with this really helped take me to that oceanside back porch, sipping my sweet tea. \n\n**PERFORMANCE**    \nThe L&L Grooming Bison Tallow base is the star of the show here. I've been waiting to get my hands on a tub of L&L for months and it does not disappoint in terms of performance. Lather whips up easily into a thick, dense foam that makes you feel like you're cutting butter with a hot knife. Seriously, I know YMMV, but L&L provides me with the best overall feeling of cushion and glide... I love this stuff. \n\nThe menthol here is also very subtle and doesn't hit you right away. It's a nice touch, as it gives you a nice post-shave cooling sensation.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**    \nBeing my first full tub of L&L Grooming, I've come away with a minor disappointment in their tubs. The labels and design aesthetic are killer, some of the best in the game but their tubs leave a bit to be desired for me. Owning only a handful of soaps (B&M, Reef Point, Phoenix & Beau, Henri et Victoria and TOBS) the feel of these clear, softer plastic tubs doesn't sit well with the price of L&L soaps. At $4.50/oz plus shipping, killer label design and seen as one of the nicer artisan soaps, I expected a nicer tub. \n\nAt the end of the day though, it's not a deal breaker. That just comes down to personal expectations versus reality. If you live in the south or you enjoy vacations on the gulf... get this stuff. It's great. ",

        "body": "It’s so annoying that they discontinued it. I let the company know several times that it’s the only spf I can use and how grateful I was that it existed and to please not change the ingredients. I’ve recommended Paula’s Choice to so many people… I still have a bit left but have no idea what I’m going to do when it runs out - I burn really easily and the dermatologist said I can’t go out without spf because it will make my skin problems even worse. It took a lot of experimentation and wasted money before I found the old version Calm spf. Even the hospital-prescribed “sensitive skin” spf felt like I had put burning hot oil on my face and I had to remove it straight away. I explained to PC that every time I have a bad reaction it makes my skin more sensitive so it’s really difficult to try a new spf knowing that it will almost definitely set off a painful inflammatory reaction and make my skin permanently worse. The thing is for those of us who have really intolerant skin, we don’t have the choice to easily switch brands. Some people didn’t like how it looked on their skin - I’m not bothered about this - it’s a medical necessity for me to wear spf if I want to go out - but actually it looked fine. I was holed up in my house for months before I found the old calm spf. It’s so upsetting that the company ignored feedback. The new formulation has had terrible reviews and a lot of their existing customers have stopped buying from them. I wish they would just bring the old formulation back. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this.",

Stuff like Worcestershire sauce, tinned veggies, tomato sauce, spice pastes etc. I bought some jarred lemongrass the other day which has citric acid added. Lemongrass contains citric acid anyway. So how do you consider these sorts of additions?\n\nLike citric acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid are found naturally in all kinds of foods that you eat. However sorbic acid and its salts less so. Glycerol occurs naturally in the body. Even some emulsifiers that are considered a \"key\" signifier for UPF are naturally occuring in a lot of foods e.g E471 (found in plant and animal fats). Even calcium chloride - your body doesn't see the calcium or the chloride differently to the ionised Ca in milk or Cl in table salt, so why do we think it is so bad if we add it to food?\n\n... its easy to get rid of the obvious UPFs from your diet, but sacrificing tinned veggies because of a bit of acidity regulator and your fave condiments that you use a dash or tbsp at a time due to a small amount of preservatives seems a bit rash considering many of them are found naturally elsewhere. So I am interested to see what other people think about these sorts of things 🙂",

As an aside: I had a shipping issue, and when I e-mailed the Farmacy customer service, I had a response and solution in 10 minutes. This obviously doesn't make their products *better* but I wanted to shout out to their stellar customer service gals.\n\n* Dew It All eye cream: Nothing much to say here; this was a cart-filler to max out my coupon value. I wear contacts and my eyes get irritated easily, so I'd been in business for an eye cream with minimal irritants. I find mineral oil (and derivatives like aquaphor and vaseline) irritate my eyes at night if I apply them too close, but products with Glycerin are less irritating. What can I say - eye creams don't cause miracles overnight, but this one is hydrating and the hyaluronic acid does visibly juice up fine lines when it's applied. I was worried the fatty alcohols would irritate my skin, but didn't experience any.\n\nINGREDIENTS: Water, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Jojoba Esters, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Patented Echinacea Purpurea ‘Greenenvytm’ Root Extract, Candelilla/ Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Undecane, Adansonia Digitata Seed (Baobab) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Gluconolactone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Tridecane, Arachidyl Alcohol, Ribose, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Behenyl Alcohol, Strelitzia Nicolai Seed Aril Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin, Gellan Gum, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Cellulose Gum, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Amino-Esters-1, Calcium Gluconate, Amino Ester-1, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Muricatum Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Algae Extract, Salicylicacid, Ocimumsanctumleafextract, Tocopherol, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Lawsonia Inermis Extract, Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Extract, Pearl Powder (Margarita Powder), Sorbic Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Glycolate.\n\n\n* Honey Savior all-in-one Salve: This one is my favorite. The texture is liquid but applies like an oil or melting balm. I've been using it on my cuticles and face where I get dry patches (chin, apples of cheeks, between eyebrows). I love the texture, smell, and it's been very nourishing and hydrating used at night. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Hydroxystearic/Linolenic/Linoleic Polyglycerides, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Honey Extract, Canola Oil, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beeswax, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Honey, Flavor.\n\n* Honey Potion Mask: Honestly thought I'd love this one more than I did. The packaging is gorgeous and it comes with a tiny magnetic spatula to apply product. But I have very sensitive skin and this product has a *very* intense warming sensation when massaged into the skin. I left it on for 5 minutes and had to wash it off because it was stinging. It made my face quite red, and burned my eyes while washing it off. Once the redness subsided, my skin did feel softer, but I think the results were not worth the pain. Masks should feel relaxing and indulgent. This one made me feel panicked. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Glycerin, Diglycerin, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Allantoin, Phenoxyethanol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Honey, Water, Flavor, Vanillyl Butyl Ether\n\n* Green Clean cleansing balm: I hadn't jumped on the oil/balm cleansing train because I don't wear heavy makeup, and always felt like a cleanser+toner was enough to clear my skin. But after trying this guy, I'm definitely going to be adding it as a pre-cleanse step for nights where my face feels greasy or dry. It has a lovely silky texture and a tiny amount gives a thorough cleanse without stripping the skin at all. It does have citrus oils, so I've only been using it at night in case it makes my skin more photosensitive. \n\nINGREDIENTS: Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid",

    "body": "So, who else remembers the creamy pepper jack sauce from the old days? That rich, cheesy goodness Taco Bell used to slather on the Baja Chalupa and stuff into the Grilled Stuft Burrito? I know I do! I've been so determined to recreate it at home, especially now that I’ve perfected homemade chalupa shells in the air fryer.\n\nOver the years, I’ve ventured down countless DIY rabbit holes, hoping to find the magic recipe, but each attempt has fallen short of that creamy, iconic flavor.\n\nThat is, until I decided to embark on a quest of my own, using my engineering skills for what might just be their highest purpose yet. But let’s back up for a moment—there’s no shortage of at-home recipes online, shared by fellow fans longing for the same taste. Yet most of these recipes miss the mark, often lacking key flavor notes or ignoring the unique texture altogether. That’s where my journey began.\n\nFor those who’ve tried it, the sauce had a distinct cheesiness—a flavor profile that’s unmistakably cheesy yet hard to replicate. Fortunately, some clever web scraping back in the day preserved Taco Bell’s ingredient list and nutritional information, once posted on their website. That data is still available if you know where to look. See the link:\n\nhttps://www.fooducate.com/product/Taco-Bell-Pepper-Jack-Sauce/541268B8-2D9E-11E2-A40C-1231381A0463\n\nAnd clever people like myself used the data to justify their recipes noting things like common ingredients to mayonnaise...like this one:\n\nhttps://eyechoirs.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/recipe-taco-bells-pepper-jack-sauce/\n\nAt this point, I started to diverge from the typical approach. While a mayo component is definitely part of the ingredient structure, after another unsatisfactory tasting session, I asked myself, “Could there be an better way to get better result than starting with mayo?” It struck me that ranch dressing also starts with a mayo base, and most of the copycat recipes simply add a “ranch additive package” on top of the mayo foundation.\n\nSo, I took a closer look at Taco Bell’s ingredient list and began comparing it to my favorite ranch dressings. At first, I didn’t find much overlap—until I remembered something important: Taco Bell’s long-standing relationship with Kraft Heinz. After some digging, I found that the Kraft Buttermilk Ranch ingredients almost exactly match the core components of Taco Bell’s Creamy pepper jack sauce. Jackpot!\n\nWhile Kraft Buttermilk Ranch might be… let’s say, basic, as far as ranch dressings go—and there’s probably a reason I’ve never bought it as a standalone dressing—the flavors line up well enough to form the foundation of the sauce I remember. And the macros (especially fat content) align with what would reasonably match the Taco Bell data (more on that later). So, I went with it.\n\nNext, I needed a way to get that pepper jack, cheesy goodness into the sauce while maintaining the ideal texture. Most copycat recipes suggest grating a good Monterey Jack cheese, applying some heat, whisking it all together, and letting it thicken in the fridge. But this approach isn’t even close to the real thing.\n\nA closer look at the ingredients list revealed entries like *\\[Semisoft Cheeses (Milk, Cheese Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Granular Monterey Jack, Cheese Blend, etc\\]*. After researching “granular cheese,” I discovered it isn’t really cheese in the conventional sense—it’s a highly processed byproduct that isn’t even available for direct purchase. This realization led me to another thought: perhaps it’s a type of liquid cheese product that could be added to the mixture.\n\nI began searching for Monterey Jack cheese sauces and found a couple of promising options, like *Muy Fresco* and another I can’t quite recall. With the ingredient lists and macro nutrient profiles in hand, I started doing the math to match the sauce’s composition. Unfortunately, I quickly realized the macros weren’t aligning. No combination I tried could match the 7g fat content in a 14g serving size, for instance. I even experimented with another macro-dense ingredient, like Parmesan, but still couldn’t get the math to math (more on that later).  So back to the drawing board, and I put my AI model to good use to try and scour the deepest corners of the web to try and find something...anything.  And I did!!!!\n\nAs luck would have it, another fast-food chain offers a sauce that nearly matches the ingredients profile and macros needed to complete the formula—with a few interesting and unexpected surprises. Those familiar with Little Caesars might know their incredible *Cheezy Jalapeno sauce*. Not only does it contain similar “obscure” cheese ingredients (granular Monterey Jack and semi-soft cheese made from milk, cheese cultures, salt, and enzymes), but it also includes jalapeno, already built right in, JACKPOT!\n\nSo, my first step was to have AI combine the ingredient lists from *Kraft Heinz Buttermilk Ranch* and *Cheezy Jalapeno Sauce* into a table for comparison against the “target recipe” of Taco Bell’s Creamy Pepper Jack Sauce. I created three columns: the first for the common ingredients, the second for ingredients unique to the Creamy pepper jack sauce, and the third for ingredients unique to the combined sauce. The results were surprising! There was a high overlap right away, with most of the unique ingredients falling into the additive category. Only three key ingredients stood out as unique to the target sauce:\n\n1. **Dehydrated bell pepper chunks** – unique to the Taco Bell sauce.\n2. **Mustard seed** – also unique to the Taco Bell sauce.\n3. **Parmesan** – listed only in the Taco Bell sauce, while a generic cheese product appeared in the combined sauce.\n\nThe first two ingredients were easy to address empirically: adding dehydrated bell pepper and mustard seed directly into the sauce and taste-testing. With these straightforward additions, most of the flavor profile was now in place.\n\nThis left only the Parmesan/generic cheese product discrepancy. While not a perfect match, I decided to proceed, hoping that this small variation wouldn’t significantly affect the outcome. What’s also intriguing is the role of additives and preservatives; I used AI to analyze these components and found a functional overlap in both recipes, reinforcing that the two sauces were surprisingly aligned in structure. Parsing the ingredient differences and overlaps yielded 18 common ingredients, 6 overlapping functions, and 8 unique ingredients left for further analysis. With a solid understanding of the functional overlap, I could now proceed with a deeper analysis of the ingredient list. I used an AI model to measure the qualitative differences between the target sauce ingredients list and the Ranch/Cheezy Jalapeno mixture, making a couple assumptions:\n\n1.  I would be adding in the more heterogenious ingredients that are present in the target recipe ingredients list back to the Ranch/Cheezy Jalapeno mixture (i.e. the dehydrated bell peppers and mustard seed).\n\n2. Ingredients like preservatives that may be different chemicals but functionally overlap, Would be considered direct swaps.\n\n3.  Several of the remaining unique ingredients don’t impact flavor or texture (for instance, the yellow dyes), so weighted scoring would be applied to account for their reduced impact. This approach makes the model more accurate than a straightforward evaluation of ingredient presence or absence. FYI an excerpt here, I spent way too much time training the AI models throughout this whole shindig and somehow at some point during this whole process ended up in a PID loop lol. But I digress…\n\nThe results were shocking! Without diving into too many details, I had the AI model run three different numerical models, each using a different method to calculate ingredient weight scales. These models factored in complex variables like flavor interactions, total ingredient count, and the number of flavor enhancers present, the list goes on. Interestingly, all final similarity scores, even though they had been calculated in very different ways, came back within 1% of each other! It’s worth noting that, without a way to precisely quantify the “flavor” of each ingredient, this remains an approximation.  But the fact that the results were all so close is pretty cool none the less. Below is the middle value calculation because i didn’t want to put up all 3 and this one happened to be the simplest so this is what i went with.\n\nA. Target Unique Ingredients\n\n1. Potassium Sorbate (Preservative): Low weight, as it doesn’t significantly impact taste or texture. Weight: 0.1\n\n2. Sodium Benzoate (Preservative): Low weight, for the same reasons as Potassium \tSorbate. Weight: 0.1\n\n3. Parmesan (Umami/Savory Flavor): High weight, as it contributes significantly to taste. Weight: 0.3\n\nB. Solution Unique Ingredients\n\n4. Sorbic Acid (Preservative): Low weight, similar to Potassium Sorbate and Sodium \tBenzoate. Weight: 0.1\n\n5,6.. FD&C Yellow #5 and #6 (Color Additives): Medium weight, as they contribute to \tappearance but not flavor or texture. Weight: 0.15\n\n7. Sodium Phosphate (Texture Stabilizer): Medium weight, as it affects texture but not flavor. Weight: 0.15\n\n8. Polysorbate 60 (Texture Stabilizer): Medium weight, same reasoning as Sodium \tPhosphate. Weight: 0.15\n\n9. Sugar (Sweetener): Medium weight, as it affects flavor balance. Weight: 0.15\n\n10. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) (Umami Enhancer): High weight, significant impact on taste. Weight: 0.3\n\n11. Phosphoric Acid (Acidity): Medium weight, affecting flavor balance. Weight: 0.15\n\n12. Cheese Blend (Umami/Savory Flavor): This ingredient adds depth to the savory profile, similar to Parmesan in the Target list. It should have a high weight due to its impact on taste. Weight: 0.3\n\nTotal Ingredients: 32  \n  \nShared Functional Ingredients: 24  \n  \nUnique Ingredients Count:  32-24 =8  \n  \n**Unique Weights:**  \n  \nTarget Sauce Unique Weight: 0.5  \n  \nSolution Sauce Unique Weight: 1.6\n\n  \n(See IMG1 calculations for calculating the Similarity score)\n\nAnd there we have it! An approximate **98.36% flavor profile similarity score**.\n\nThe final step is to verify this against macro and micronutrient data to confirm if the flavor profile is on target. Recall that earlier, I compared the total serving size by mass against the fat content mass of the original sauce since the sauce is predominantly fat-based. To determine if the ingredients in the mixture could provide a viable solution, I needed to ensure that the fat content could reach a **0.5 gram-per-gram ratio**—matching the Creamy pepper Jack sauce's documented 7 grams of fat per 14-gram serving.\n\nIn my initial tests with the combination of Buttermilk Ranch and a monterey jack cheese sauce (lMuy Fresco), the quantities didn’t converge, as the fat content was significantly lower, around 6g per 62g serving, or <0.1. However, with the Cheezy Jalapeno sauce, a simple dual-equation algebra problem yielded a **perfect 0.5 gram/gram convergence** at a ratio of **36.39% Cheezy Jalapeno sauce to 63.61% Buttermilk Ranch**.\n\nWith the fat content aligning well to the total serving mass, I then applied this ratio to the other ingredients, leveraging the 98% similarity score to see if the combined ingredient quantities would also align. A close alignment here is a strong indicator that the flavor profile should be highly accurate.  **Table provided below:**\n\n\n\n(See IMG2 Nutrients Alignment Table)  \n\n\nRight away it can be observed that the raw numbers of the new concoction are extremely close to the Creamy pepper Jack sauce with the one exception of sodium.  But to be fair with the data I applied an AI derived weighting model basing the total contributions on 100% and scaling the similarity score based on impact to the recipe because, for instance, while values that are calculated at 0 gram quantity have a 100% match to the target, they have far less of an impact to the similarity of the dishes.  Not non-existent, since presence would define a difference, but less than the more obviously impactful categories.  The model also compared other variables when creating its weighting scale, such as overall percentages of mass, which nutrients are null to flavor/texture etc. \n\nWith the weight scale applied and the weighted contributions calculated, the overall similarity score of the nutritional data comes out to 94.2% similar!!! I’d call that validation within some level of certainty at least!  \n\nAll that was left was to head to Little Caesars, the fancy grocer where you pay an arm and a leg for ingredients like dehydrated bell pepper flakes and Kraft buttermilk ranch, and hit taco bell on the way home for a few Chalupa supreme's (-)tomatoes, (+)pico and carefully iterate the 2 remaining ingredients into the mixture (mustard seed, and dried Bell Pepper flakes).  3 chalupas and a few iterations later ending up around a ⅛ tsp of each of the 2 remaining ingredients, folks all I can say is it’s amazing.  I can almost feel my teenage years returning to me!  So there you have it, the story about how I (successfully? you be the judge)  reverse engineered the makeup of the infamous Taco Bell Creamy Pepper Jack Sauce!  \n\n  \n64% by mass Kraft Heinz Buttermilk Ranch  \n36% by mass Little Creasers Cheezy Jalapeno Dip  \nthen add 1/8 tsp mustard seed and 1/8 tsp dried bell pepper flakes per 14g serving \n\n",

To treat your grandmother the doctors will need to analyze the growth to identify the cause, probably by taking a biopsy. If I had to guess, I would say the urgency stems from the very rapid growth of the mass.\n\nI wish you, your grandmother, and the rest of your family the best!",

    "body": "I asked about the info on this label a few days ago and someone suggested that I just Google each ingredient. I did that and here's what I found if anyone is interested.\n\nThe info here is all pretty basic, most of it copied and pasted from various sources, but its more info than I had a few days ago. \n\nThank you!\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\n\nServing size: 8 fl. oz. (240 mL)\n\nServings Per Container 2\n\n___\n\nAmount per serving\n\n**Calories** 0\n\n**Total Fat** 0g (0%)\n\n**Sodium 180mg** (8%)\n\n**Total Carbohydrate** 1g (0%)\n\nSugars 0g\n\n**Erythritol** 1g - Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol) is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States and throughout much of the world. In general, erythritol is free of side effects in regular use. Doses over 50 grams (1.8 oz) can cause a significant increase in nausea and stomach rumbling (borborygmi). Rarely, erythritol can cause allergic hives (urticaria).\n\nWhen compared with other sugar alcohols, it is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol, or lactitol.\n\n**Protein** 0g\n\n___\n\n**Niacin** 100% - Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NO2 and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients.\n\nNot enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. \n\nHowever, too much is also bad. Pharmacological doses of niacin (1.5 - 6 g per day) lead to side effects that can include dermatological conditions such as skin flushing and itching, dry skin, and skin rashes including eczema exacerbation and acanthosis nigricans. \n\n**Vitamin B6** 100% - The primary role of vitamin B6 is to act as a coenzyme to many other enzymes in the body that are involved predominantly in metabolism. \n\nThere were lots of fancy words here I didnt get, but I get the feeling its to help you metabolize sugar and to give your body quicker, more immediate access to the energy in the drink.\n\n**Vitamin B12** 100% - Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis (especially odd chain fatty acids) and energy production.\n\nThe dietary reference intake for an adult ranges from 2 to 3 µg per day (USA), and 1.5 µg per day (UK). 1 µg = 1e-6g. Seriously, you need very little...\n\nHowever, Vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. At levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and poor memory may be experienced.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.\n\n**Pantothenic Acid** 100% - Also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin. For many animals, pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient. Animals require pantothenic acid to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This metabolic function is probably why its in the drink.\n\nA normal adult male/female (14yo+) needs 5mg/day. \n\nDeficiency of this acid is so rare that it has not been thoroughly studied. Toxicity of pantothenic acid is unlikely. In fact, no Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL) has been established for the vitamin. Large doses of the vitamin, when ingested, have no reported side effects and massive doses (e.g., 10 g/day) may only yield mild intestinal distress, and diarrhea at worst. It has been suggested, however, that high doses of pantothenic acid might worsen panic attacks in those with panic disorder by prolonging the duration until adrenal exhaustion.\n\n___\n\nIngredients:\n\n**Carbonated Water** - Unflavoured carbonated water erodes tooth enamel, though the effect is negligible.\n\nIntake of carbonated beverages has not been associated with increased bone fracture risk in observational studies, and the net effect of carbonated beverage constituents on the amount of calcium in the body is negligible. Carbonated water eases the symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia) and constipation, according to a study in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.\n\nA 2004 article in the Journal of Nutrition found that fizzy waters with higher sodium levels reduced cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular problems in postmenopausal women.\n\n**Citric Acid** - Seems like it's mostly for flavor, preservative, and it plays a role in the metabolism.\n\n**Erythritol** - See above.\n\n**Taurine** - Taurine is actually a naturally occurring organic acid and is widely distributed in animal tissue. It accounts for 0.1% of your total body weight. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Also serves a few other roles. For example, it acts as an antioxidant and has also been shown to help people with congestive heart failure by increasing the force and effectiveness of heart-muscle contractions.\n\nTaurine is involved in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, the role of taurine in these processes is not clearly understood and the influence of high taurine doses on these processes is uncertain.It may also be necessary to take into consideration that absorption of taurine from beverages may be more rapid than from foods.\n\n**Sodium Citrate** - Food additive. Sodium citrate is sometimes used as an acidity regulator in drinks.\n\n**Benzoic Acid** (Preservative) - \n\n**Caffeine** - Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant. Consumption of 1000–1500 mg per day (a Rockstar contains 240mg per can) is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and heart palpitations after caffeine use.\n\nCaffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90). This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). \n\nThe symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.\n\nIn cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.\n\nExtreme overdose can result in death. The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats. The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass or roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult, or 300 cups of coffee for an adult living in the year 3000.\n\n**Acesulfame Potassium** - Acesulfame potassium is a calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener), also known as Acesulfame K or Ace K (K being the symbol for potassium), and marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One.\n\nAs with other artificial sweeteners, there is concern over the safety of acesulfame potassium. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved their general use. Critics say acesulfame potassium has not been studied adequately and may be carcinogenic, although these claims have been dismissed by the FDA  and by equivalent authorities in the European Union.\n\nResearch suggests that acesulfame K may affect prenatal development. One study appeared to show that acesulfame K is ingested by mice through their mother's amniotic fluid or breast milk, and that this influences the adult mouse's sweet preference.\n\nAdditional research on the effects of acesulfame K on mice revealed that chronic use over a period of 40 days resulted in a moderate but limited effect on neurometabolic function. These results suggest that chronic usage of acesulfame K may lead to impairment of cognitive function.\n\n**Glucuronolactone** - Glucuronolactone is a naturally occurring chemical that is an important structural component of nearly all connective tissues. Glucuronolactone is rapidly absorbed and metabolized into non-toxic metabolites such as xylulose. In addition, humans may be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for ascorbic acid synthesis.\n\nGlucuronolactone is a popular ingredient in energy drinks with claims that it detoxifies the body. Although levels of glucuronolactone in energy drinks can far exceed those found in the rest of the diet, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that exposure to glucuronolactone from regular consumption of energy drinks is not a safety concern. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of glucuronolactone is 1000 mg/kg/day. (Rockstar contains 100 mg per can.)\n\n**Sucralose** - Sucralose is an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body, so it is noncaloric.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of sucralose that can be consumed over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 9 milligrams per day per kilogram of body weight.\n\n**Sorbic Acid** (Preservative) - Sorbic acid, or 2,4-hexadienoic acid, is a natural organic compound used as a food preservative. The LD50 value of sorbic acid is estimated between 10-7.4 g/kg, which is quite high. The compound is relatively unstable and is rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is often considered environmentally friendly.\n\n**Pantothenic Acid** - See above.\n\n**Niacinamide** - Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide and nicotinic amide, is the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3 / niacin). Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B group. Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is converted to nicotinamide in vivo, and, though the two are identical in their vitamin functions, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological and toxic effects of niacin, which occur incidental to niacin's conversion. Thus nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing, although nicotinamide may be toxic to the liver at doses exceeding 3 g/day for adults.\n\n**Inositol** - Inositol and some of its mono and polyphosphates function as the basis for a number of signaling and secondary messenger molecules. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including:\n\nInsulin signal transduction, \n\nCytoskeleton assembly, \n\nNerve guidance (Epsin), \n\nIntracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration control, \n\nCell membrane potential maintenance, \n\nBreakdown of fats and reducing blood cholesterol, \n\nGene expression.\n\nSome preliminary results of studies on high-dose inositol supplements show promising results for people suffering from problems such as bulimia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), agoraphobia, and unipolar and bipolar depression.\n\nAccording to research, foods containing the highest concentrations of myo-inositol (including its compounds) include fruits, beans, grains and nuts.\n\n**Natural Flavor** - Flavors naturally.\n\n**Milk Thistle Extract** - Traditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin. The extract consists of about 65–80% silymarin (a flavonolignan complex) and 20–35% fatty acids, including linoleic acid.\n\nIn herbalism, it is used in cases of liver diseases (cirrhosis, jaundice and hepatitis), gallbladder disease, and is claimed to protect the liver against poisons.\n\nResearch suggests that milk thistle extracts both prevent and repair damage to the liver from toluene and/or xylene. Workers who had been exposed to vapors from toluene and/or xylene for 5–20 years were given either a standardized milk thistle extract (80% silymarin) or placebo for 30 days. The workers taking the milk thistle extract showed significant improvement in liver function tests (ALT and AST) and platelet counts vs. the placebo group.\n\nBeside benefits for liver disease, other unproven treatment claims include:\n\nLowering cholesterol levels\n\nReducing insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes who also have cirrhosis,\n\nReducing the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate cancers.\n\nClinical study has shown that liver function tests can be improved in active hepatitis patients.\n\nAlzheimer's Disease prevention or treatment.\n\n\n**Gum Arabic** - Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. \n\nGum arabic's mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins gives it the properties of a glue and binder which is edible by humans. Other substances have replaced it in situations where their toxicity is not an issue, as the proportions of the various chemicals in gum arabic vary widely and make it unpredictable. Still, it remains an important ingredient in soft drink syrups, \"hard\" gummy candies such as gumdrops, marshmallows, M&M's chocolate candies, and edible glitter, a very popular, modern cake-decorating staple. Also called acacia after the original source, gum arabic is used as an emulsifier and a thickening agent in icing, fillings, chewing gum and other confectionery treats.\n\n**Ester Gum** - Glycerol ester of wood rosin, also known as glyceryl abietate or ester gum, is an oil-soluble food additive (E number E445). The food-grade material is used in foods, beverages, and cosmetics to keep oils in suspension in water.\n\n**Pyridoxine Hydrochloride** - Pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6, along with pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. \n\nVitamin B6 assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. It is linked to cardiovascular health by decreasing the formation of homocysteine. Pyridoxine may help balance hormonal changes in women and aid the immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth.\n\n**Panax Ginseng Root Extract** -  Folk medicine attributes various benefits to oral use of American ginseng and Asian ginseng (P. ginseng) roots, including roles as an aphrodisiac, stimulant, type II diabetes treatment, or cure for sexual dysfunction in men.\n\nA common side effect of P. ginseng may be insomnia, but this effect is disputed. Other side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, nose bleeds, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and breast pain. Ginseng may also lead to induction of mania in depressed patients who mix it with antidepressants.\n\n**Guarana Seed Extract** - Guarana is a climbing plant in the maple family, Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil.\n\nIn the United States, guarana has received the designation of \"generally recognized as safe\" by the American Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPreliminary research has shown guarana may affect how quickly the body perceives itself to be full. One study showed an average 5.1 kg (11.2 lb) weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guarana, and damiana, compared to an average one-pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days. Although inconclusive about specific effects due only to guarana, this study differs from another showing no effect on body weight of a formula containing guarana.\n\nGuarana extract reduced aggregation of rabbit platelets by up to 37 percent below control values and decreased platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid by 78 percent below control values. It is not known if such platelet action has any effect on the risk of heart attack or ischemic stroke.\n\n**Caramel Color** - Caramel color or caramel coloring is a water soluble food coloring. Caramel color is a colloid. Though the primary function of caramel color is for coloration, it also serves additional functions. In soft drinks, it can function as an emulsifier to help inhibit the formation of certain types of \"floc\" and its light protective quality can aid in preventing oxidation of the flavoring components in bottled beverages.\n\nCalifornia has listed a compound formed in the manufacture of Class III and IV caramel colors in the state's Proposition 65,[17] which requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals \"known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\"\n\n**Cyanocobalamin** - Cyanocobalamin is the most common and widely produced of the chemical compounds that have vitamin activity as vitamin B12. \n\nThe oral use of cyanocobalamin may lead to several allergic reactions such as hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. Less-serious side effects may include headache, nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea, joint pain, itching, or rash.\n\n___\n\nIn Each Serving:\n\nTaurine 1000mg\n\nCaffeine 120 mg\n\nGlucuronolactone 50 mg\n\nInositol 25 mg.\n",

    "body": "Hi! To keep this short I want to right away give you a sense of the skin issues I’m trying to solve… I have horribly sensitive dry skin and nearly every moisturizer I ever tried stung/burned my face or gave me awful closed comedone breakouts… until I found Avene Tolerence Extreme Cream about a year and a half ago. It actually moisturized my face and didn’t sting almost ever (and when it did, it was very faint and prob the result of humectancy + actives). I also loved that it only had 7 ingredients so I could’ve actually narrowed down what caused any face-stinging (but never happened to a degree I needed to). And then… they reformulated it. 🙃 I was just so fed up and thought “I should learn chemistry and just make it myself” and thus found this sub.\n\nI want to keep my ingredient list short and sweet, so after a lot of research, I came up with the following formula which I made and initially liked a lot (and it stayed emulsified, hallelujah!):\n\nwater - 65%\nglycerine - 5%\nshea butter - 12%\nsafflower oil - 7%\npetrolatum - 5%\ncolloidal oatmeal - 5%\noptiphen plus - 1%\n\nI did notice a very faint stinging, but I figured it’s something I can live with. However, I also use a prescription retinoid and forgot sunscreen one day last week and my new homemade moisturizer BURNED! just like all the commercial ones I’ve used. So bummed. I’m fairly certain it’s the preservative (maybe the sorbic acid?) especially in combo with glycerine.\n\nAll this to say… what now? Either I find a bsp that won’t irritate my skin (unlikely considering my reactions to.. every other moisturizer) or I go without. Which, from what I can tell, would mean anhydrous as the most accessible at-home method. (But if you do have sensitive skin preservative suggestions, I would still love to hear them!!)\n\nThere are only two water stage ingredients in my formula to begin with (water+glycerine), so mainly my anhydrous moisturizer questions are:\n\n1) Without water, how moisturizing will this be (my skin is soo dry)? Would increasing the occlusivity of my formula be beneficial (I’ve been thinking about adding dimethicone) or detrimental, especially considering I’m acne-prone, so...\n\n2) How comedogenic would an anhydrous moisturizer used 2x daily be? Considering the ingredients I chose haven’t thus far broken me out, is there any pore-clogging risk in removing the water content? (I don’t care at all about how greasy it would be, I’ve been vaseline-ing my face in the cold winter air since my youth).\n\nSorry if this got a bit long or confusing. I have a bad habit of over-explaining/info-dumping. I’ve spent quite a bit of time lurking on this sub and the info you guys provide has been invaluable to me. I hadn’t been able to find an answer to this question, but sorry if it’s clear as day and I’m just kind of dumb… lol. Thanks for all the work you all do to keep cosmetic hobbyists safe :)",

Though more could mean more irritation if you’re sensitive. Maybe you can reduce the colloidal oats to 1%. That seems the standard amount in a lot of commercial products. \n\nAlthough maybe it’s not your lotion that burned but just your skin reacting to sun exposure. Especially since you’re on a prescription retinoid. \n\nHow comedogenic something is can be quite personal so I can’t really say how any ingredient might affect you. Since you claim to use straight petroletum on your face already, you can just use that as an occlusive. Though I find very dry skin benefits from humectants. The best humectants work best in a formula with water. Maybe you could try mixing glycerin and petroletum before applying to a damp face. That would be pretty sticky though so I would only do that at night. \n\nAnyway, sorry they reformulated the one thing that works for you. Have you tried vanicream? I hear good things about that for people with ingredients sensitivities. Good luck.",

I've tried The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant, Clinique, Sunday Riley, and now have tried this Skin Actives.  \nI do like the formula. Some of you with more knowledge can probably better critique it than I could so here's the ingredients list (Water, Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin, Ferulic Acid, Alpha-D-Tocopherol, Phloretin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherols, Astaxanthin, Lycopene, Xanthophyll, R-Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta-Carotene, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Juice Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Juice Extract, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol (and) Caprylyl Glycol (and) Sorbic Acid.)  \nAt this point, although I've had two bottles, I've gone through only about 3/4 of ONE bottle and that is because this serum has got some SERIOUS packaging issues. My first bottle would not pump UP the product. It's an airless pump and so the bottom is supposed to push the product up when it gets used, but mine never did. I would have to hold it upside down and pump into my hand- not the biggest deal until the actual spout where the product comes out just flew off the bottle one day when I pressed down on the pump. I could technically still pump out product but it would just kind of dribble out and the opening got all crystalized from the ascorbic acid. At this point I sent an e-mail to the company, explaining what I had experienced. They were very understanding, said it happens, and sent me out a replacement which I soon received. I started using my replacement bottle and had the same issue with the bottom not pumping up to push the product out. Not a huge deal, like before I just flipped the bottle to pump it into my hand. Well this morning the little nozzle thing shot off again. I think it gets clogged by ascorbic acid crystals. I would buy this again if they changed the package but I know they JUST started using this packaging in November (according to their website) so I don't see that happening soon.   \n**TLDR: The packaging was super faulty on both bottles I had.**",

Since looking online I realized it must have not been a popular powder foundation since I can not find any dupes online for it (if you have one please let me know). I did see they have created the Bareminerals Blemish Rescue powder foundation tho. Looking at the ingredients list, it looks like the Rescue has quite a bit more in it than the Remedy had so I'm not sure if it will be comparable. I do not have any makeup store near me to test out the new Rescue formula, but for people who have tried it, is it similar to the Remedy formula? I can not find any reviews comparing the two.\n\nBareminerals Remedy Ingredients:\nLauroyl Lysine, Silica, Salicylic Acid, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Soil Minerals, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Litchi Chinensis Fruit Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Disodium Edta, Limonene, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Sorbic Acid.

I also find it to be less drying, has better packaging, and doesn't have the strong scent the remedy did.",

It contains only one mineral filter, titanium dioxide (18.99%). It's oil-free. Yes, it contains dimethicone, but it only shows up about halfway down the ingredients list. No fragrance or essential oils.\n\nI tested it on the back of my hand. It is tinted, but the tint is *very* fair. It's lighter than my skintone and I am NW15. Thankfully (for me) the tint leans pink, not yellow. The lotion left a silky feeling on the back of my hand that persisted after washing.\n\nHas anyone tried this product?

However some toners have ALEURITIC ACID, Aleuritic Acid(probably a lipid), sorbic acid and ROSMARINIC ACID etc. Its driving me crazy :P Is there any way to identify AHAs?

Folic acid is a common form for the vitamin Folate.  Lactic acid is both made in your body, and also how a lot of fermented foods are made, in addition to being an additive.  Sorbic acid is a preservative.\n\nThat they are acids shouldn't matter, and the methylphenidate related warning appears to be just related to citric/ascorbic acid, and for that, in larger quantities consumed at the same time. (Almost everything is either an acid or a base, even if it doesn't have the word acid on the end, if that helps.)\n\nHere's a list of other potential interactions: https://reference.medscape.com/drug/ritalin-sr-methylphenidate-342999#3 ...although you'd need to lookup the reason elsewhere, as some in the \"monitor\" category may not be an issue in your case, may increase the effect, or require other situations to be true.",

decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

        "body": "Of your list, I've only used the fresh soy cleanser and the caudalie products. But I looked up some of the Pacifica and Philosophy products on cosdna.com and the ingredients on those seem fine too. \n\nPersonally, I like to alternate my products a lot but that's because I know they all work for me/ don't break me out. I think the best thing for you would be to pick a cleanser and moisturizer now and then swap them out for your others if it's not working for you. \n\n**Cleanser** (Morning and night, pick one to start with, then swap it out for another one. If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun. You're young, but sun damage can really exacerbate all skincare issues down the road.",

It won't hurt your hair at all because it doesn't open your cuticle, like permanent and demi-permanent color processing does. [Here's info from labmuffin on different types of hair color that goes into more detail.](https://labmuffin.com/how-does-hair-dye-work/)\n\nLunar Tides' description is right that it's non-damaging — the ingredients indicate an intensive conditioner + color. That's it! So there's no need to wait to color or to use a second conditioner right before or after you apply the color. If you want deeper conditioning (and more intense color) just leave the Lunar Tides color on longer. (Careful though, the color can get pretty intense.)\n\nThe only thing to consider in terms of your hair's condition when applying the color is that you need to make sure you're applying it evenly, so lots of color coats ALL your hair, otherwise, you can get a patchy results. Lunar Tides' instructions will tell you to start with towel dried hair (so, slightly wet) and that helps with even application. You can also start with slightly wetter hair and leave the color on longer (I did this last time, it was fine).",

If your hair has mixed amount of damage (like roots are healthy but ends are fried) it might be a good idea to do a conditioning treatment first so that your hair all soaks up the dye evenly.

The only thing that made a discernible difference on my scar was silicone scar sheets - available in drugstores in the US. They are $$$ but you apply them (sticky like a bandage), leave them on for a designated amount of time then replace with a new sheet. They lightened the scar. I couldn't afford to buy another box and my scar was at least 10 years old when I tried them but it worked at the time! Good luck",

Make a small batch and don't use any hard to preserve ingredients like aloe vera. \n\nI remember reading a discussion on Chemist Corner where Perry said DMDMH alone often worked fine and passed microbe test, but can't find that thread. \n\nAlso, [Optiphen is not recommended for surfactant systems](http://www.makingskincare.com/preservatives/).

While poking around online to find more info about hard water's effects on skin, I came across this article where Dr. Dennis Gross suggests using distilled water or micellar waters exclusively when washing the face (advice I've heard from several other sources as well). He also suggests (of course) his own overpriced cream with a \"chelating complex\" http://www.self.com/story/hard-water-acne    \n\nI agree that his cream sounded kinda bogus to me, but it still got me thinking... if I add a chelating agent like disodium EDTA to my toner, would that have any benefit? Could that possibly help reduce the effects of the excess Ca/Mg from my hard water?    \n\nI assumed that chelating agents mostly work on binding ions within the product, not necessarily *on your skin*... but *could* it possibly work in that way? I do know that \"hard water\" shampoos contain EDTA to remove excess minerals while shampooing, but I've never really heard of this for leave-on products    \n\nAny thoughts on this, and any recommendations on which to use? From Lotioncrafter's advice,  perhaps I should stick with tetrasodium EDTA (even though my toner is ~pH 5, LC recommends tetrasodium b/c my toner is a clear aqueous product)?

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive.

It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below.

        "body": "I have long, fine hair too, and I totally feel your pain on how long air drying takes! I’ve never tried Hairstory, but I like the Verb Ghost line a lot. I’ve use the shampoo and conditioner for about six months, and I’ve tried the hair mask and oil from the same line. The Ghost hair mask is very light, so if you felt weighed down by others, definitely try that one. I use the oil sparingly at night any time my ends feel dry and I always wake up to super soft hair. I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer. Good luck with your search!",

    "body": "Hi guys\nI’m located in japan, and locating equipment and chemicals is problematic so far.  I’d prefer to try as ‘natural’ as possible anyway.  \nI was able to get the redstar 5 yeast variety pack.  I’ve also rigged up some fermentation vessels and air locks.\nI’d like to try useing high quality store juices (ie Apple, cranberry mix, welches and winery grape juice).  I already started a batch of pawpaw’s grape juice (bakers yeast and sugar).\nI also grow some organic fruit, and just succeeded in totally natural grape fermenting (small experimental batch).  I need to harvest all my grapes now, so must act now.  I posted my experiences and questions in the winemaking section, but not getting any responses so thought to repost here:\n\n\nFurther Points/questions:\n\nSurprisingly, most of the grapes have reached near ripeness now.. They are completely organic, and have never seen rain, as they have a covered trellis (better yeast?).  As mentioned above, this table grapes is often used to make rose wine.\n“ ワイン ピオーネ” in google image search will illustrate.  I believe they are cross between kyoho and muscat.\nI hope to make them naturally like this guy:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xlOBqM1L1II\n\n\nMy best house temp currently swings from about 13-19 degrees (night/day), and is likely to get cooler as the season progresses.. Iiuc, this is within white wine range, and a rose would be slightly higher.  I have an accurate thermostatically controlled heat blanket used for other purposes, will be difficult to adapt to this but possible.\n\nAn alternate meathod useing a cold press juicer is here.  (my juice comes out looking like a pink rose wine color whether I crushed by hand and ferment, or use a machine juicer for fresh juice.):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gEcETG6Hkg&app=desktop\n\nInstead of bakers yeast, I’d try natural.  My red star 5 pack of mixed yeasts should arrive today (as a backup, experiment).  (This is the only brewing equipment I’ve been able to find in country so far).   I would also consider removing the pulp immediately after juicing, perhaps able to make a very light rose.  Seeds are crushed in juicer though.  \n\nAs mentioned above, the very rough experiment has turned out wonderfully so far.  After maybe a week, I transferred the mash from an open bowl to a pickling container with a plunger that keeps the pulp submerged (no airlock).   after a couple of weeks, some “flowers“  (mold) formed on top so I removed those. Squeezed pulp and Transferred to a bottle with a balloon airlock last week where it’s continue to bubble away.  Not sure about storage etc. or what’s going to happen next. Still quite a bit of carbonation coming off of it which is awesome.  There’s very little so have not drank much.. Would it be advisable to use the sediment in the bottom as a starter in the next batch?\n\nAt this point, my plan is to put most of the grapes in a primary fermenter, smashed by hand, shake it up every day for first week, with an airlock in place.. Leave it for maybe 2-4 weeks, then rack/squeeze pulp and leave until all the bubbles stop.  Then drink or try to store it somehow.  At current temperatures, I got a feeling this might take a while, but perhaps it will preserve the fruity flavors better.. So no added yeast (unless there’s an emergency) and no added sugar etc.\n\nAs a side, I’ve already started a batch of PawPaw’s Welches grape juice with sugar and local  bakers yeast.  \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c8sVCfGTTjA\n\nI also have plans to get some high-quality juices of various types and use it with the RedStar Brewers yeasts supposed to arrive today.\n\nCouple more general questions:  \nIs this the correct hydrometer?\nhttps://a.aliexpress.com/_mLZVk5J\n\ncan I add fresh grapes to an existing ferment?  Would adding sorbic acid (vitamin C) to the mash help to prevent oxidization?  \nI assume a rose is my best bet for my pione grapes.  Of the red star yeast I have, premier rouge and champagne blanc are specifically recommended for rose. Champagne blanc lists as being able to handle cooler temperatures, like the premier cuvée. what would be the advantage in using the Cuvée in this case?\n\nThanks so much again",
