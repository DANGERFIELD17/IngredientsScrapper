    "body": "Biggest contributor to my skin one year ago was the fact that I was addicted to heroin. I was constantly scratching my skin and physically exfoliating because it makes you itch like crazy. Once I started recovery I got really into skincare but finding the right products for my skin was so hard. I have super sensitive combination skin. I reacted badly to almost every product | tried, either directly after applying or it would make me break out after 1-2 days. I wasted so much money on skincare items but at least it wasn't for nothing because I finally have a routine that my skin loves! :)\n\nStep one: Avene xeracalm oil cleanser\n\nStep two: Isana ultra sensitive calming serum\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Polyglycery -6 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Coco-Caprylate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Hydrogenated Vegetable Glycerides, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Oenothera Biennis Oil, Panthenol, Ethylhexy|glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Pantolactone\n\nRight now it's still hot where I live so it's hydrating enough but when it gets colder I use vaseline at night to look in the moisture.\n\nI also use tea tree oil as spot treatment for pimpler & Salicylic acid to exfoliate when I can tell mys v needs it (less than once a week, even that was tu-much for my sensitive skin, it caused break outs)\n\nI do also use sunscreen but I haven't found the right one yet. If someone with similar skin problems has any advice l'd appreciate it!",

I would say if you're a fan of the Avene  brand I would try their facial suncreen in the small bottle or their face and body sunscreen in the bigger bottle. Both are SPF 50 I believe and are mineral so there's less of a risk of irritation. My skin is like yours, I know how hard it can be for us to find products that work and ease irritation and sensitivity.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "So, it sucks yet again to recommend another product that isn't available internationally, but maybe if you happen to be in MX or you find a service like forward me, or someone who do you the favor, you can get it...\n\nI used this product several years ago when I first started to transition into some zero waste cosmetics and of personal use, and actually this had been purchased by a friend of mine who didn't like it and decided to gift it to me... I never repurchased it until now! I have a mosquito issue these days, some of my windows don't have the mosquito net, and I do sleep with my door open so my dogs and fosters can leave the bedroom for midnight pees, I kept waking up lately due to mosquitoes and while oregano oil (diluted in olive oil) works, I didn't fancy going to sleep smelling like a salad so I repurchased this: [https://indraecosmetica.com/collections/cuidado-corporal/products/repelente-citromenta](https://indraecosmetica.com/collections/cuidado-corporal/products/repelente-citromenta) It's like 5.5$usd with todays currency rate. \n\nThe ingredients are: Cocoa Butter (Theobroma Cacao), Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii Butter), Kokum butter (Garcinia Indica), Wax Candelilla, (Euphorbia Cerifera), Neem oil (Melia azadirachta) stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, Citronella essential oils (Cymbopogon nardus), Peppermint (Mentha piperita), Rosemary (Rosemary officinalis Spanish Leaf Oil), Lemongrass (Cymbpogon flexuosus) ,Spearmint (Mentha spicat), Mica\n\nIn their website it looks a lot more green than it actually is. The color is like coco butter. I'm not attaching photo cause mine has a bit of dog hair lol.\n\nI'm guessing because it has so many butters it stays better on the skin, I don't even find that I have to coat my exposed skin entirely but rather certain areas, the smell lingers and mosquitos don't butter me. You do feel it on the skin, but personally not to the point that it is an issue. I also have quite sensitive skin and I've been fine, perhaps I don't apply it to my face but the back of the neck and its okay. It doesn't seem to bother my dogs either. \n\nThey send it wrap in paper, I don't know what kind of paper it is, but kind of like baking paper, and I've kept it there and it doesn't sweat off through the paper into my things, and its fine. I think those wax papers should be good for it too.",

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

It looks like Laneige recently (?) released a new sleeping mask with centella asiatica extract as its main selling point. At 60mL, it's smaller than the 70mL Water Sleeping Mask. It retails for about 32,000 KRW and so far I've seen it on Gmarket and Testerkorea. EDIT: It's also available for 20,000 KRW on Coupang for those who live in Korea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredients from [cosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d77e425390.html)\n\n>water, propanediol, cetyl ethylhexanoate, squalane, hydrogenated poly(C6-14 olefin), gylcerin, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Glyceryl stearate citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Polyglyceryl-10 stearate, Hydroxyethyl acrylate / sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, butylene glycol, acrylates / c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, gylceryl caprylate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Sorbitan isostearate, Asiatic acid, Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Martini Oil, Tocopherol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't used the Water Sleeping Mask before, but I've read mixed reviews on it and I'm curious how the two products will compare. The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

The cream is an opaque white whereas the other sleeping masks are more gel like and translucent. It’s definitely not heavy or suffocating thick cream and it’s surprisingly spreadable and not as dense or oily as expected? I haven’t tried it so I’m useless lol but I hope that was some decent product description. I can’t remember if there’s a scent so probably nothing toooo strong. I have oilier skin so I really don’t use creams until the fall/winter. But I’m excited bc I love cica stuff and yeah Liah did hype it up a bit lol",

    "body": "Cleansing balms\n\nUPDATE 8/20/20: I’m adding a new balm I’ve recently tried (at the bottom of the list). If anyone has tried balms that you’d like to review in the format used, please post them below!!!\n\nOk, I’ve been (still am) on a mission to try and review all of the best/most popular cleansing balms in an effort to find the very very best one. I’ve tried nearly all of the most popular ones now. I searched everywhere for a comprehensive review of all of these and couldn’t find much so I’m hoping this will be a helpful resource to others who might be looking too. I welcome any input!!\n\nBackstory:\nI had been using The Body Shop’s Camomile balm since way before cleansing balms went mainstream, for probably a decade at least. I never knew there were other options until I was given a sample of Farmacy Green Clean and that’s what started me down this path - I wanted to see what the best option truly is! I liked my Camomile but could there be a better balm out there waiting for me??!\n\nAs always, YMMV but below are my results! All prices are in Canadian dollars and I have not researched pricing or availability in other countries.\n\nAs for what I actually use it for - I don’t wear a full face of makeup every single day but I do always wear a tinted sunscreen and mascara at a minimum, usually with a light powder foundation, blush and brow gel as well. I’ve tried every balm below on little to no makeup up to a full face of special occasion makeup.\n\nA note about ingredients - I’ve copied ingredient lists below from the brands websites. It was important to me to evaluate which ones have polyethylene (plastic) as well as essential oils.\n\nI would LOVE to hear your thoughts on those below or any other options I haven’t tried yet!\n\n**TL;DR FINAL VERDICT**: for a really good clean and soft face, Drunk Elephant’s Slaii is probably the best value in terms of value, packaging, ingredients, etc. I think this will continue to be my go to in the super dry winter months (especially since I tend to wear a bit thicker makeup in the winter), but to be honest, I think I will probably continue use my trusty Body Shop Camomile Cleansing Butter in the summers.\n\n**The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter**\n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $17 CAD @ The Body Shop reg price (but it’s often on sale).   \nPrice per oz: $5.67/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a wide and flat metal tin that is perfect for storing bobby pins or things in after (no plastic packaging, yay!). I have had a few times over the years where the threads get misaligned and stuck if it was tightened wrong and have needed to use a knife or screwdriver to pry it open again.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it stays a little solid as you rub it into your skin. I wouldn’t say it emulsifies 100% to an oil but it feels great on the face and it’s super spreadable once warmed up. Doesn’t feel greasy/oily, more creamy.    \nScent: Very neutral scent, I don’t believe there are any added scents, essential oils or fragrances.    \nOn the Eyes: It doesn’t sting the eyes at all, but sometimes there’s a light film, if so I just blink a few times and it goes away.    \nAmount Required: A very small amount is required for my whole face (probably about 1/2 tsp max) and one tin easily lasts me a few months.    \nIngredients: No plastic to be found here! I also love that the ingredient list is short and sweet.    \nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Citric Acid.    \n\nVERDICT: I’ve loved this forever and to be honest, now that I’ve tried some others I’m not totally sure if the grass is actually greener on the other side. Still a top contender for me and the price is amazing! I do wonder though if my skin feels a just a tiny bit less moisturized after using this (compared to some of the others below)...\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean** \n\nSize: 90mL (3oz).   \nPrice: $45 CAD @ Sephora Canada.   \nPrice per oz: $15/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes, but the plastic tray it is stored in is very flimsy (sits in top of the tub).    \nTexture & Emulsion: When scooping the balm out, it melts easily and emulsifies quickly to rub around your face. Not greasy/oily.    \nScent: Light citrusy scent (almost like a lime sherbert or something) that smells so good I just want it all over my face all the time.    \nOn the Eyes: I do find it causes quite a bit of a film if I use it on the eyes (something I’d never really experienced before with the Camomile balm), no stinging unless it gets directly in the eyes. Makeup dissolves easily with minimal rubbing or tugging.    \nAmount Required: A small amount is required.    \nIngredients: While they say it’s not “microbeads” and that it melts in water, this product does contain polyethylene aka plastic. Take that for what you will. This product does have quite a bit of essential oils and extracts.    \n\nCetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Peg-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Peg-10 Isostearate, Polyethylene, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Amino Esters-1, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Amber Powder, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Water/ Aqua/ Eau, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Echinacea Purpurea Root Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Moringa Pterygosperma Seed Extract, Disodium Phosphate, Citric Acid.   \n\n\nVERDICT: I like it, I love it, I want some more of it. It smells amazing and feels luxurious on the face. Even though a little goes a long way, I do have a hard time justifying spending that much money on a first cleanser (and I don’t love that it contains polyethylene and a lot of essential oils).\n\n**Physicians Formula The Perfect Matcha 3-in-1 Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\nSize: 41mL (1.4oz).  \nPrice: $15 CAD @ Shoppers Drug Mart (also find at Walmart, Superstore etc).   \nPrice per oz: $10.71/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a screw top and an internal insert underneath. The insert holds the very tiny spatula.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes but it’s tiny, about the size of a safety pin.   \nTexture & Emulsion: It melts but it’s not overly emollient and isn’t as spreadable as others I’ve tried.    \nScent: Sort of a light essential oily/green tea/citrus scent. Some say it smells like Green Clean but I completely disagree and it’s nowhere near as nice of a smell.    \nOn the Eyes: A bit of eye stinging and a definite film was to be had.    \nAmount Required: Larger amount required to effectively remove makeup/sunscreen of any I’ve tried to date.    \nIngredients: Looks like we have that ever present plastic again (polyethylene) as well as fragrance, food colouring and citrus essential oils. Sad face.    \nCETYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SORBETH-30 TETRAOLEATE, PEG-5 GLYCERYL TRIISOSTEARATE, PEG-10 ISOSTEARATE, POLYETHYLENE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, CAMELLIA SINENSIS LEAF POWDER*, PHYLLOSTACHYS EDULIS SHOOT WATER**, NELUMBO NUCIFERA FLOWER EXTRACT***, CITRUS NOBILIS (MANDARIN ORANGE) PEEL OIL, WATER/EAU, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE, POLYGLYCERYL-10 OLEATE, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, MALTODEXTRIN, YELLOW 5 (CI 19140), BLUE 1 (CI 42090). *MATCHA, **BAMBOO, ***LOTUS\n\nVERDICT: It’s a no from me, dawg. I couldn’t wait to finish this (relatively small) tub so I could try the next product. Having heard so many claims that it’s a perfect dupe for Green Clean, I was VERY disappointed. IMO they are nothing alike other than the colour (both balms are a light green colour). Smell, texture, effectiveness, price, ingredients - nothing wowed me.\n\n**Heimish All Clean Balm**\n\nSize: 120mL (4oz).   \nPrice: $23.95 CAD @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $5.99/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a plastic tub with a flip top. Under the lid is a second lid which holds the included spatula. I like that the spatula is separated from the product but the extra lid makes it extra bulky in my cabinet.    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.   \nTexture & Emulsion: This balm I’d say emulsified almost immediately to a complete oil. It has a light oil feel (similar to say a sunflower oil, not as thick as an olive oil for example). It melts right away once it touches your face and feels like an oil face massage as you rub it in. It feels quite luxurious!    \nScent: Light floral scent (smells like essential oils). I like it and it’s not too overpowering IMO but I have heard some people find it too strong of a scent.    \nOn the Eyes: No stinging and the eye film is minimal.    \nAmount Required: I’d say a medium amount. Definitely more than the Camomile and Green Clean but it doesn’t seem excessive.    \nIngredients: There is polyethylene (plastic) in this as well as a number of essential oils which those with sensitive skin may wish to avoid.    \nEthylhexyl palmitate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, polyethylene, PEG-8 isostearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, citrus aurantifolia (lime) fruit extract, freesia refracta extract, iris versicolor extract, jasminum officinale (jasmine) extract, lilium tigrinum extract, leontopodium alpinum extract, nelumbium speciosum flower extract, narcissus pseudo-narcissus (daffodil) flower extract, rose extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, lavandula angustifolia (lavender) oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, amyris balsamifera bark oil, citrus paradisi (grapefruit) peel oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) leaf oil, juniperus mexicana oil, boswellia carterii oil, citrus aurantium bergamia (bergamot) fruit oil, tocopheryl acetate, 1,2-hexanediol.\n\nVERDICT: There’s a lot to love about this - the scent and the texture are awesome, the price is definitely right, and I enjoy using it. My skin does always feel great after and it doesn’t dry me out. Cons for me are the bulky packaging, the amount of essential oils and the microbeads. I do like it but I’m not ready to stop my search quite yet.\n\n**Drunk Elephant Slaai**\n\nSize: 115mL (3.83oz).   \nPrice: $45 @ Sephora Canada.   \n(Note that this price includes a small vial of Bamboo Booster (physical exfoliating grains) as well).   \nPrice per oz: $11.75/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top. The spatula is magnetic and sits on top of the tub via a magnet (super handy for the makeup cupboard but also exposed/can pop off in a makeup bag while travelling).    \nScoop/Spatula included: Yes.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Feels like softened butter and emulsifies to a thick oil feeling (similar to olive oil).     \nScent: Neutral, but a light olive oil type scent. I wish it had a nicer smell but it’s not offensive.     \nOn the Eyes: No stinging, easily removed eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: just a little, I’d say the smallest amount of any I’ve tried which is great news for it lasting a good while.\n\nIngredients: There don’t appear to be any polyethylene in this product and it’s lighter on the essential oils as well (good news if you have sensitive skin).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Lauryl Laurate, Polyglyceryl-3 Laurate, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Oil, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Ananassa (Strawberry) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Schinziophyton Rautanenii Kernel Oil, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Ximenia Americana Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Glycerin\n\nVERDICT: Love love love! Definitely don’t use too much but when using a small amount the oiliness isn’t too much and it makes my face feel soft and clean. However, a second cleanse is a must.\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Balm**\n\nSize: 125mL (4.17oz).    \nPrice: $40 @ Sephora Canada.    \nPrice per oz: $9.59/oz.    \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.    \nTexture & Emulsion: Texture is comparable to a solid form coconut oil (similar to the Heimish balm in texture and colour also). Emulsified quickly to a soft oil.    \nScent: Unscented.    \nOn the Eyes: A light film, but no stinging. Takes extra rubbing to loosen stubborn eye makeup.    \nAmount Required: Medium amount (not as much as Heimish but not as little as Drunk Elephant).    \n\nIngredients: Very short ingredients list but unfortunately, those classic plastics are in this balm as well (polyethylene).\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate , Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate , Polyethylene , Peg-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate , Water\\Aqua\\Eau , Tocopherol , Phenoxyethanol\n\nVERDICT: Honestly, I have no real bad things to say. It’s utilitarian. It doesn’t feel luxurious but it works.\n\n\n**Acure Seriously Soothing 3 in 1 Serum**\n\nSize: 50mL (1.7 oz).   \nPrice: $23.49 @ well.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $13.82/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a glass jar with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: No.   \nTexture & Emulsion: A very soft solid serum that gets a little melty when room temperature is quite warm. It melts immediately in your hand/on your face and becomes a liquidy oil. It feels luxurious but does leave an oily film so a second cleanse is definitely required.\nScent: Strong scent due to the blue tansy oil (some might not like it but I do!)\nOn the Eyes: It’s very gentle and doesn’t sting or leave a film.\nAmount Required: Very little required. I’d say about half a teaspoon for my whole face including eye makeup.\nIngredients: No plastic here! Just very basic natural ingredients.\n\nCaprylic/capric Triglyceride, Euphorbia Cerifera(Candelilla) Wax, Copernicia Cerifera(Carnauba) Wax, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Rosa Canina(Rosehip) Seed Oil, Argania Spinosa(Argan) Oil, Tocopherol(Vitamin E), Tanacetum Annum (Blue Tansy)flower Oil, Ribes Nigrum (Black Currant)seed Oil.\n\nVERDICT: I didn’t originally buy this for a cleanser, (just as a balm) but used it in a pinch as my first cleanse when I accidentally lost my jar of Slaai on a camping trip. I love how my skin feels soft and soothed after using it as a cleanser and it feels so silky on my skin. It is a little on the expensive side but I think it’s a keeper for sure seeing as it’s so versatile!!\n\n**Banila Co. Clean It Zero Original Balm Cleanser**\n\nSize: 100mL (3.3 oz).   \nPrice: $27.96 @ Amazon.ca.   \nPrice per oz: $8.40/oz.   \nPackaging: This balm comes in a tub with a screw top.    \nScoop/Spatula included: TBD.   \nTexture &amp;amp; Emulsion: TBD.   \nScent: TBD.   \nOn the Eyes: TBD.    \nAmount Required: TBD.   \nIngredients: Doesn’t look like there’s any microbeads in this bad boy, thankfully!\n\nEthylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, PEG-10 Isostearate, Synthetic Wax, Onsen-Sui, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Lithospermum Erythrorhizon Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Angelica Archangelica Root Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Polydiethyleneglycol Adipate/IPDI Copolymer, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Acrylates/Methoxy PEG-15 Methacrylate Copolymer\n\nVERDICT: TBD - haven’t tried it yet but I plan to so I’ve included the info I was able to find so far.\n\n\nYour turn!

    "body": "I’ve tried many creams and hydrating serums/toners over the years, but consistently the best one at plumping and hydrating and overall being a sponge to water has not been a face or body product but a hand cream. The LRP Cicaplast hand cream absorbs water like crazy (probably because of the 30% glycerin), plumping up the skin instantly (especially if you apply it to wet skin). It’s also got 4% niacinamide, as well as shea butter and dimethicone to complete the cream (so it’s not just a humectant-style product). It works fine alone but I like to layer another cream on top overnight to really pack in that moisture in my dry climate, my favorite combo with it being Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cream.\n\nBecause it’s made for the hands, it seems to be formulated to not be too greasy or tacky as well.\n\n(I’ve heard people say similar things about using the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream on the face, which also has high percentage glycerin—I think 40%.)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nAQUA/ WATER ∙ **GLYCERIN** ∙ BUTYLENE GLYCOL ∙ CETEARYL ALCOHOL ∙ **NIACINAMIDE** ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE ∙ **BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER** ∙ **DIMETHICONE** ∙ PEG / PPG-18/18 DIMETHICONE ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE SE ∙ SODIUM POLYACRYLATE ∙ CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ∙ PHENOXYETHANOL\n\nEdit: I wouldn’t suggest using this as an AM moisturizer. It’s got quite a thick ointment texture—great for overnight moisturization, but not great for using under sunscreen and makeup and such.",

    "body": "[I purchased this item myself.](https://i.imgur.com/ZKt37cP.jpg) \n\n\n# Impressions, Fragrance, Packaging\n\nI'm only going to quickly hit some of these points. I'm going to primarily focus my review around the ingredients and my thoughts on the new formulation. I'm sure many others will focus on the rest.\n\nGeneral impressions of the product are great and typical of what we've come to expect from Barrister and Mann. I always enjoy the little goodies and extras thrown in (this time some fitting espresso hard candies). I see BaM is now using the Parkway 100mm low profile jars that have become ubiquitous in artisan shaving soap. I haven't purchased a new soap for perhaps a year — is this a new change or has this been the case for a while?\n\nI personally love the fragrance of Leviathan, though I can understand it can be polarizing. \"It smells like you just smoked a cigar and tried to cover it up with a fragrance\" — my loving wife. That deep, black coffee and leather combination is intoxicating. Soap is frankly a terrible way to experience fragrance, but [I have a bottle of Leviathan aftershave from perhaps 2016 or 2017](https://i.imgur.com/B2z2qwM.jpg) that allows me to pick up the nuance. There's more sweetness and spice in the liquid form. Again, many other Leviathan reviews around talking about the fragrance. I will yield to those.\n\n\n# Performance\n\nWhat can I say? It's superb. A modern classic and a worthy sibling to BaM's other creations. I was hoping it could hold a candle to Reserve - one of my other favorites - and it does; improves even, on some of Reserve's best qualities.\n\nThe lather is so dense [it becomes almost waxy](https://i.imgur.com/SYRsScz.jpg) (I mean that in a good way). It's so water tolerant that it's almost water resistant (again, a little tongue-in-cheek, but I mean it in a good way). Water really needs to be worked into the lather to get the benefit of the performance. It doesn't behave like a \"foamy\" soap. If foamy soaps pull bubbles out of air, this soap instead pulls texture from water. It's thick and smooth. Not foamy and pillowy. \n\nThe slickness and skin feel when shaving is also best-in-class comfortable. \n\nPost shave feeling rivals Reserve. \n\nI would expect a lot of high praise for Omnibus coming soon. \n\n# Ingredients\n\nOk, for the main event.\n\n*Water, Potassium Stearate, Glycerin, Potassium Tallowate, Potassium Kokum Butterate, Sodium Stearate, Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Juice, Potassium Ricinoleate, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Tetrasodium Ethylendiamine Disuccinate, Fragrance, Xanthan Gum, Theobroma Grandiflorum Butter, Sodium Kokum Butterate, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Potassium Cocoate, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium Ricinoleate, Goat Milk Powder, Persea Grattisima Oil, Sodium Cocoate, Althaea Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Rubra Extract*\n\nI'll give my best insight on the ingredient list. But I'm not an expert and I can only base my insights on my own experience, which is imperfect in itself. You can only glean so much from an ingredient list before it takes the person formulating it to explain the why's and how's. The \"secret sauce\", as it were, is the combination of the ingredients, the relative amounts of each, why each individual component was chosen over an alternative, how they interact and counteract, and the process by which it all comes together. That's not something that we're going to know and that's not something we should expect or ask any soapmaker - or businessperson at large - to divulge. Basically I'm saying that my ability to interpret this stuff is flawed by the very nature of even doing this. I think it's important to have that humility before any of us try to analyze ingredients - myself included.\n\n**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil**. These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified. There is nothing particularly questionable or curious here and I would say we often see high performing soaps with a version of these \"base\" ingredients. \n\n**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide**. I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\". Both sodium and potassium hydroxide are used as the caustic reagents. Again, nothing particularly unique about that in shaving soap. Both are generally solubilized into water. I'm going to guess that coconut milk and the goat milk powder are added to this solution as well, but it's just a guess. Those things could be added somewhere else. Milks are often substituted for water or in addition to water in an effort to make a lather less pillowy and more creamy. I've never seen any science on that, but that's generally the narrative espoused in the soapmaking community so I'll mention it. Like most things in soapmaking, once you nail down a core formula of ingredients, the other onesy-twosy additives tend to be incremental rather than fundamental, at least in my experience. Enough of those ingredients cleverly combined I think can make for a distinguishable performance difference cumulatively, but it's tough for me to tie one unit of a given ingredient to one unit of performance. So I won't attempt to do that with the milks used here.\n\n**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil**. This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant. Many ingredients going into the soapmaking process vs coming out of the soapmaking process are compositionally different. Any oils, butters, or triglyceride-containing stuff still in their \"original\" form on this ingredient list means it must be the superfat. I'm of the opinion that the amount and the constituent components of the superfat have a good hand in how the lather behaves and feels. Others might disagree with that, but I'm going to say this unique combination of oils in the superfat probably have a meaningful role in determining how dense, protective, and stable the lather feels on the face. The importance of the superfat I think is particularly unique in shaving soap. \"Stability\" and \"denseness\" of a lather don't really matter in other forms of soap. Body soap, hand soap, even shampoo; most all other surfactant applications are rinse-off almost as quickly as applied. A shaving soap provides critical buffer between an in-motion blade and the skin for minutes at a time, so that kind of thing matters.\n\n**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate**. We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\". Hydroxyethylcellulose I know to be a thickening ingredient. In fact, when you see any \"cellulose\" on a label, that's generally what those ingredients are for. I've used it a couple times when messing around with making shampoo, but I didn't go much further. I found it to be incredibly finicky. It was stubborn to melt and quickly became tough to work with when cooled. I really don't know what it's used for here. If you've ever made a high stearic soap, you know that it has a tendency to seize up. I wouldn't think you would want to thicken a soap like this - it's the first time I've seen this ingredient in a shaving soap - but I don't know what it behaves like when it's cooking and I don't know the process steps involved to make it. It does make sodium lactate even more curious because I've always used sodium lactate in shaving soap as an ingredient to metaphorically \"even out the high spots\". Things just mix a little easier with it and it cures the soap a little more consistently. Part vanity, part functional. It's also a humectant, so there's a theoretical skin benefit there, too. \n\n**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate**. Let's go with so-called \"skin food\". This far down the ingredient list, I can only more or less guess at some of these. I'm sure Will would raise a skeptical eyebrow or two, but here goes. The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property. They are very concentrated, and for that reason, you will most always see them at or near the bottom of an ingredient list used in tiny quantities. I haven't used these particular extracts, but I have used others. Xanthan gum could have a few uses. It's in many cosmetics as a thickener and stabilizer, but I included it in this category because I've heard Will talk about it in the context of skin feel. I think I remember he pointed to xanthan gum as a potential cause of poor after-shave feel for those who under-hydrated the previous Excelsior formula. The xanthan gum effectively \"used up all the water\". So maybe the intent with xanthan gum in this formula is to alter the stability of the lather's water-tolerance? Especially seeing how this soap behaves with water; that'd be my guess - used as an ingredient to keep water in the soap and keep the lather from \"breaking\", but who knows. It interacts with water in a big way, though, so I know it must have something to do with that property. Sacharride isometerate is a moisturizer / emollient.\n\nHere's the \"other\" category: **Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin**. Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\n**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here. Because of where it appears on the ingredient list, it's not used in negligible amounts, so I have to believe it has some kind of meaningful functional purpose - like a detergent or foaming property or something - but I've never used it or heard of this particular flavor of sulfonic acid. Reading about it doesn't give me any better or more insightful shot at it so I'm just going to leave it at *shrug.*\n\n# My Thoughts\n\nWill has always done a great job pushing the envelope of ingredients in his soaps. In my opinion, he innovates more than probably anyone else in the artisan sphere and doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been. \n\nI'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better. But I am saying that there is a vocal group of people with opinions about cosmetics that appear to confuse synthetic for \"dangerous\", and minimal for optimal. And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nThat is my primary purpose for writing a review up this way. Just wanted to share my perspective on this latest creation and explain how pleased I am to see continual innovation in artisan formulation. I'm probably a little off in my analysis, it's tough to make these kinds of assumptions and generalizations. But that's not really the point. I wanted to make a write-up to bring some attention to this kind of pursuit. \n\nIt takes a ton of work to reformulate a product. I will often see people talk about a new soap fragrance in the same vein as a new soap base. This is understandable. From the perspective of a customer, it's a very similar buying experience and feeling of anticipation. And I'm sure artisans spend enormous amounts of time tinkering with a fragrance. But innovating on a soap formula is a little bit of a different skill and it's a much bigger commitment from the standpoint of the business. There are re-packaging considerations, stability considerations, and most of all, there's a lot of trial and error. In short, it is a risk. Even more so when you're working with ingredients that aren't traditionally used or often used at all in soap.\n\nSo hats off for Omnibus. I'm happy to say it joins the ranks among Reserve and Milksteak as my favorite all-around performers.\n\nCheers!",

        "body": "Okay, full rundown:\n\n>**Stearic Acid, Tallow, Kokum Butter, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil.** These are what I would consider the \"base oils\" so to speak. It's sort of the heart of the soap; the unique fatty acid makeup that give the lather a large portion of its performance character once saponified.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Water, Coconut Milk, Goat Milk Powder, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide.** I'm going to call this collection of ingredients the \"caustic solution\".\n\nMostly correct, but I'm afraid that the reason why is a trade secret. :)\n\n>**Shea Butter, Cupuacu Butter, Avocado Oil.** This is the superfat. On most ingredient lists, you would not be able to distinguish the superfat from the rest, but Barrister and Mann is one of the few who list ingredients post-saponification, or a little more INCI-compliant.\n\nCorrect!\n\n>**Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Lactate.** We're starting to get into ingredients that can serve more than one purpose, but again, knowing my own interpretations are going to be wrong anyway, I'll go ahead and call these the \"texturizers\".\n\nLess correct, but you're absolutely right that HEC is a pain to work with; it's going to take me until the third production batch to get some of the stuff to stop seizing into little bits. These two materials are not really related to each other in any functional sense, though; the HEC serves as a lubricant and to help tame the drying effects of xanthan gum, while the sodium lactate is used to make the soap both more pliable when it's hot and harder when it's cool. \n\n>**Marshmallow Root Extract, Slippery Root Extract, Xanthan Gum, Saccharide Isomerate.** Let's go with so-called \"skin food\"...The extracts are generally what people talk about when you hear the word \"botanicals\". They're extracted components of plants and almost always have a purported anti-irritation or skin-benefitting property.\n\nAgain, partly correct. Marshmallow and slippery elm are both skin soothers and moisturizers (their internal \"mucilage\" helps keep your skin feeling nice, and they contain various other classes of molecules that serve as anti-irritants. I actually experimented with using a few other botanicals as well, most notably licorice, but found that most of them provide limited benefit and impart weird colors and/or aromas to the base, which, if I'm being honest, smells faintly of graham crackers off the puck.\n\nXanthan gum serves the same function that it did in Excelsior and Soft Heart, which is as a lubricant. However, as noted, it has a tendency to try people's skin unless you dump HUGE amounts of water into it, so I opted to remedy this effect by replacing some of it with hydroxyethylcellulose, which is much easier on the skin, but not perfect on its own.\n\nSaccharide Isomerate is a contact moisturizer that can tolerate alkaline environments, and the level at which we use it can actually increase moisture retention in skin to which it's applied by as much as 10%.\n\n>**Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate and Glycerin.** Tetrasodium Ethylendiamene Disuccinate is a chelator. It's basically a \"green\" version of Tetrasodium EDTA. Good hard water performance is probably thanks to this ingredient in part. There's nothing special or unique about Glycerin, I just put it in \"other\" because I can't tell if glycerin is an added ingredient or if it's just the glycerin released in the soapmaking process. That's a consequence of how this product is labeled. \n\nCorrect about the TED: it's biodegradable, unlike tetrasodium EDTA, and doesn't present the same \"OMG IT'S POISON\" vibe that the green community has applied to EDTA. Both are harmless, for those curious.\n\nAs for glycerin, we use additional glycerin in the soapmaking process, which is why it appears on the ingredient list so prominently.\n\n>**Polyacrylamidomethylpropane Sulfonic Acid** - I'm putting this one in the \"wtf\" category. No clue what it's used for here.\n\nAh, the magic material. Also known by its equally inscrutable trade name Rheocare HSP-1180, this is a synthetic anionic polymer produced from renewable feedstocks. It improves lubrication dramatically and imparts a luxurious, talc-like post-shave without sealing the skin or exhibiting comedogenic behavior, meaning that it cannot clog pores or cause breakouts. It's fascinating stuff, and one of the most exciting things that I have ever come across in cosmetic chemistry.\n\n>doesn't let the sometimes-misinformed or preconceived perspectives of consumers en-masse influence his pursuit. The \"if you can't pronounce it, don't use it\" crowd I think is in stronger force today than it has ever been.\n\n>I'm not saying that more ingredients or complicated ingredients = better.

And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nI too really appreciate your saying this. I believe strongly that much of the improvements that we have seen in the past decade of shaving soap development are due to radical technological advancements over the last 70 years, and it seems absurd to me to exclude things like renewable polymers and chelating agents from that conversation simply because they have scary sounding names. My explanation to folks regarding natural materials is generally along the following lines: Arsenic, cyanide, and lily of the valley are all completely natural. All three will kill you. Painfully. Natural does not mean safe or better, and synthetic does not mean dangerous or bad. They're all just tools.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll in all, you did really well! It's important that people understand what is being used in the products that go on their faces, and, while there's a \"secret sauce\" aspect to this, but I've said nothing here that someone couldn't learn with Google, and the real secrets are in the proportions and methodologies, not the list itself. I have nothing to hide, and everything that we use is quite safe according to every authority that I can find (that isn't, you know, some dimwit screaming about how \"chemicals\" are bad).\n\nEither way, I appreciate your taking the time to break it down for folks; I mean to put up a blog post on the subject by the end of the week, but we'll see if that actually comes to fruition. :D",

And it is great to see that the philosophy at Barrister and Mann is still that the best ingredients must win, not the best-looking-labeled ingredients.\n\nWhere do I even begin... I can't appreciate this comment by you enough. The number of time I have shaked my heads at people's comments like \"this isn't a true soap\", \"essential oil only\" has probably helped my neck health a lot. Our dumbfounded fear of science can be a such an issue - not just in shaving, but in 2021 something/everything else as well.\n\nAnyway, appreciate your writeup.",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Before I got super busy with my new job, I used to regularly post reviews over on r/AsianBeauty. I really enjoyed that process, and now that things have mellowed out a bit for me, I wanted to start doing the same here. \n\nI generally try to review products that I don't see too often on skincare subs. Past reviews have included [Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/87r241/review_missha_near_skin_madecanol_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8cejd0/review_missha_near_skin_phyto_azulen_cream/), [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/), and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d’abeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for £17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

    "body": "So, Superdrug brought out a Calm Skin range at the end of last year. [It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

        "body": "> Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot? \n\nSalicylic acid isn't just a chemical exfoliant, it's also anti-inflammatory, which would make it calming on inflammation. Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern. Thanks for sharing these products!",

Best non subscription help sofar has been [Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream](https://www.avene.co.uk/face/specific-care/hypersensitive-allergic-or-intolerant-skin/tolerance-extreme-cream) for daily use, during outbreaks combined with [Avene Xeracalm concentrate](https://incidecoder.com/products/avene-xeracalm-a-d-soothing-concentrate). But the last one is very emollient and is used best at night. So when I had a new patch under my eye I decided to try [Ducray Dexyane Med for eyes](https://www.ducray.com/en-gb/dexyane-med/dexyane-med-palpebral).\n\nIt feels so good. Soothing af. Not as emollient as the xeracalm concentrate but don't expect eye makeup to last when you're using it. I use [SVR palpebral](https://uk.labo-svr.com/products/palpebral-topialyse-eye-cream) when I wear eye makeup as it's not that emollient and performs better with makeup. The Ducray one is really well at healing patches. After 2 or 3 days the patch was almost cleared up and what I love is it immediately took away the itching burning sensation. Posted as it might help someone else as well!\n\nPrice is about 12/15 euro for 15 ml. I got it on promotion and paid 10 euro.

    "body": "Here's a review that no one really asked for but is going to get anyways. AYLM isn't a very popular brand around here, I think other than /u/cadinsor 's love for the soap, my enjoyment and maybe a few others it's often overlooked for various and solid reasons. \n\n[Recently ALYM came out with a hard soap](https://abbateylamantia.it/en/shop/hard-shaving-soap/), a stark contrast to their soft Italian croap that we're use to. The intended purpose of this soap is to be a travel soap, it says it right on the lid and it's also 2.82oz but I was most intrigued with the new base than anything else, well the scent was interesting too but I'll get to that later.\n\n**Ingredients** \n\nHere is what AYLM lists as the ingredients for their hard soap: \n\n> INCI AYLM Hard Formula: Sodium Palmate*, Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Aqua, Sodium Palm Kernelate*, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Stearate, Glycerin, Parfum**, Menthol, Persea Gratissima, Glycerin*, Palm Kernel Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter , Sodium Chloride, Glycerin, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid, Pentasodium Pentetate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Crocus Sativus Stigma Extract*, CI 77891. \n\nThis does lead to a much harder soap than their normal offerings, the puck isn't rock solid it's soft enough you can squish if you press a bit you cannot scoop it like a cream. \n\n**Packaging**\n\nThis isn't a factor for most but I like to bring it up and AYLM always has top notch packaging. The tin comes in a box with label and ingredients, inside the box is the tin with a nice label and info, inside the tin is the wrapped puck left loose. It's great packaging if you're worried about plastic usages. \n\nThe tin is a little small but I had no issues loading a massive 28mm brush but remember it's a travel soap. \n\n**Loading & Lathering** \n\nLike majority of Italian soaps I loaded this with a shaken out brush as Italian soaps if you go in with a damp brush you get a lot of foamy mess, so unless you want to do the Marco method and use 1/10th of your soap do that. But shaken out brush the soap loads easy, lots of suds but it loads quick and easy.\n\nLathering was also very easy just get it on the face and do you thing. The lather itself I found to be denser and creamier than their standard base. To me it's kinda like Catie's Bubbles but a bit denser than that if it makes sense to anyone. It handles water very well, nice and glossy lather it definitely works for me. \n\nThere is menthol in this and it's nothing strong I'd say 4.5-5 on coldness depending on your sensitivity. It's definitely not painfully strong but it's present and cooling, a very enjoyable level of cooling I'd say. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nThis is what was the other main draw for me, the scent is nothing crazy they just listed it as a blue tobacco with menthol, sounds good to me. The scents are tobacco, eucalyptus and menthol. When I first got it I mainly smelled eucalyptus basically like a Proraso Green but now that I've used it a bit more it's a bit more powdery from the tobacco but still get a good amount of the eucalyptus and menthol but I enjoy it. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI always liked ALYM bases for their slickness, it was always great for straights and I've never had an issues with the performance of this soap. This base doesn't fall short of my expectations, maybe even a bit better honestly just for how much more water this could take vs their standard base. \n\nIn the shaves I've had with this I had a few days of growth and easily took off the bulk of hair in the first pass leaving me with a very close and comfortable shave. \n\n**Post Shave**\n\nNow this won't be a powerhouse like a lot of artisan soaps but I guess it's the saffron extract they use and this has a few extra butters but my face just felt smooth and comfortable. Wasn't overly soft or sticky/tacky like some artisan soaps, used a pretty simple splash and felt no needed for a balm and I was quite pleased. This kinda base and feel is great for me in the summer time but winter it may be a bit lacking just with how dry my skin is then, right now it's plenty hydrated. \n\n**The Price**\n\nI cannot avoid this but lets be quick, it's 21€, $24USD or $29CAD. That's up there for 2.82oz  for sure and you can get a lot more for less but I've also spent just as much for soaps I haven't enjoyed. If you like it money well spent, if you don't money wasted. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI enjoy this soap, it works for me in the warmer months, I like it for straights so for me I'll enjoy this tub. I'm sure there are others who would enjoy this too and others who will think it's lacking in a lot of areas. If you're a fan of Italian soaps or similar European soaps give this a try, if you're all in on US artisans and how their bases are now I'd maybe avoid it and buy something you like. \n\n**Disclaimer: I bought this with my own funds, I wasn't asked for a reviews or compensated for writing said review**",

    "body": "Waitrose have a skin/hair care line called 'Pure' which is fragrance free, hypoallergenic, cruelty free and uses mostly 'naturally derived' ingredients, whatever that means. It's also really cheap, and regularly on offer. I know this isn't a hair care sub, but their shampoo and conditioners are fab, and extremely good value. The dry/damaged conditioner is how I make it up to my hair for bleaching it to all hell. \n\nAnyway, I got a few of the skincare products a few months ago when they were doing 3 for 2. They're now on 1/3 off, so I thought I'd post some mini-reviews. \n\nI would describe my skin as oily, somewhat congested, and quick to anger. It’s also probably somewhat dehydrated by bad office aircon and just, like, winter in general. \n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Hot Cloth Cleanser** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-hot-cloth/508007-539993-539994\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Candelilla Cera, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Oryza Sativa Powder, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Triticum Vulgare Germ Oil, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Aqua, Tocopherol,  Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Phytate\n\n**Verdict:** God, I wanted to like this. I love hot cloth cleansers, and this one was so simple and cheap - and it even comes with a cloth! However, the rice powder totally ruins it for me - using a face cloth is exfoliating enough, and I don’t want even a gentle scrub on my face. If you are super into scrubbing your face, this might be perfect - it’s not going to rip you to shreds like walnut shells, and it’s not illegal  and murderous like microbeads. \n\nI was very sad about this until I realised that what I did now have was a super-luxurious body scrub. I used it the other day - I spent a long time massaging it into dry skin before taking a hot shower and washing it all off with a sponge. Because the cleanser’s so rich, my skin was very soft and moisturised afterwards, and a couple of days later the patches of KP I had were almost gone. I might do it again next weekend - it’s not really a weekday type thing because rubbing it all in takes ages, washing it all off also takes ages, and they’re both kind of the point (it’s sort of like a soothing diy massage) so you don’t want to hurry it.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Facial Oil** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-facial-oil/862289-541045-541046\n\n**Ingredients:** Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Vitis Vinifera Seed Oil, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Gossypium Herbaceum Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil,  Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Prunus Persica Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Citric Acid\n\n**Verdict:** Blergh. I sometimes do really well with facial oils - I really love the Boots Botanics Organic one - but this was just a nope all round. Bar the absence of smell, it just feels like I rubbed coconut oil into my skin. I shine with a thin film of grease. I might try it on my hair, maybe? Or try doing the OCM with it? I will say this, the packaging’s nice - a lovely frosted glass bottle - so I suppose if nothing else I can empty it out and put other things into it. As you can see, I’m trying really hard to find positives here.\n\n**Waitrose Pure Hydration Day Cream SPF 15** RRP £5, currently £3.33\nhttps://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-pure-hydration-day-cream-spf-15/450717-539849-539850\n(It says ‘this product is unavailable’ but it’s definitely for sale in multiple shops.)\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Zinc Oxide (Nano), Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sorbitan Olivate, Propanediol, Cetyl Alcohol, Simmondsia Chinesis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Phenoxyethanol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Aluminum Stearate, Sodium Phytate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Isostearic Acid, Alumina, Methylpropanediol, Tocopherol, Sodium Hydroxide, Gossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract, Lecithin, Polyglyceryl-3 Disostearate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate\n\n**Verdict:** Hell to the yeah. I really really love this moisturiser, and have just rebought it as I’m getting near the bottom of the jar and it’s on offer again. I think it’s just that my skin is a big fan of zinc oxide, since I find that Sudocrem also calms my skin down a whole bunch. It’s thick and creamy, and feels very protective against the winter wind, and it’s the only thing that seems capable of withstanding a day in the weird dry recirculated air in my office. It’s not every day you find a physical-only sunscreen for such a low price, either, even if it is only SPF15. There’s a slight whiteness as you rub it in, and people with darker skin tones might find it leaves a cast - I’m not sure, as I haven’t noticed one, but my underlying skin colour’s quite pale and so it’s not always visible on me. On days when I especially don’t care about ruining the SPF aspect (ie most days right now because it’s deepest winter and I’m barely leaving the house anyway) I will often mix in a bit of Sea Kelp Bioferment. \n\nThe Pure Natural line is even cheaper. In particular, I think it’s great that they offer some really basic thick face creams with no fragrance. I’m probably going to try out their SLS free face wash at some point.",

And this is the second time I’m purchasing it. \nI have sensitive skin and this one doesn’t sting ( even thought there’s perfume in it ? .. ) most of the time I take Korean sunscreen like Skin1004 centella sunscreen because this one is very oily and it peels a lot one the skin :( but for a summer sunscreen it’s cool 👌\n\nIngredients : Aqua (water), dicaprylyl carbonate, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, propanediol, decyl oleate, coco-caprylate/caprate, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, ethylhexyl triazone, lactobacillus ferment, cetearyl glucoside, lactobacillus, potassium cetyl phosphate, triacontanyl pvp, parfum (fragrance), tocopherol, cocos nucifera (coconut) fruit extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, glycerin, hydrogenated vegetable glycerides citrate, xanthan gum, sorbitan olivate, ethylhexylglycerin, sodium hydroxide, panthenol, cetearyl alcohol, maltodextrin, citric acid.\n\n—\n\nAnd finally, some peoples said that :\n\nLa Roche posay Cicaplast B5+ balm \n\nWas nice for sunburn, ( brought for 10,99€ ) I will not lie I wanted to buy this balm before not for sunburn but because I swim a lot and being in contact with chlorine too much can be irritating sometimes so I wanted to try it, don’t know if the aloe Vera gel would be better or not but I will try and see if one is better than the other for me. \n\nIngredients : Aqua/ water/ eau, hydrogenated polyisobutene, dimethicone, glycerin, Butyrospermum parkii butter/ shea butter, panthenol, Zea mays starch/ corn starch, propanediol, butylene glycol, cetyl PEG/ PPG-10/ 1 dimethicone, trihydroxystearin, Centella asiatica leaf extract, Polymnia sonchifolia root juice, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, alpha-glucan oligosaccharide, silica, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium sulfate, mannose, capryloyl glyc,, caprylyl glycol, vitreoscilla ferment, citric acid, trisodium ethylenediamine disuccinate, lactobacillus, acetylated glycol stearate, maltodextrin, polyglyceryl-4 isostearate, tocopherol, pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate, CI 77891/ titanium dioxide",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/ignjia8hSyc)   \n\nThanks to /u/hyvasuomi79 for the generous PIF of this soap for review.\n\nItalian Barber ([https://www.italianbarber.com/](https://www.italianbarber.com/)) brought to market a triple milled, budget friendly, shaving soap branded “What The Puck?!” in 2018. The thought behind this release was that there was enough requests coming in for a triple milled hard puck offering, that Italian Barber had to pursue it. They searched far and wide and landed on an Italian family versed in and still utilizing the methods desired to make a triple milled artisan shaving soap. Italian Barber remains committed to providing unmatched value to performance ratio in the wet shaving market. They represent one of the largest third party sellers in all of North America, and perhaps the world.\n\nRazoRock \"What The Puck?!\" Orange Sunrise is the straight forward scent of Sicilian Blood Orange. This scent is not sweet, but smells more like the peel of an orange. The scent is not the most realistic representation of an orange, there is a synthetic presence in the scent that makes it smell similar to a packet of Vitamin C supplement that you’d take at the onset of a cold. The scent is not unpleasant, it's just not exact in its intent. I would consider this a multi purpose wear, because it is light and inoffensive. I would also consider this a multi seasonal wear because it is a single note fragrance. Scent strength is light off the puck and remains light once lathered. A similar scent from wet shaving is: Dapper Dragon Naranja.\n\n\"What The Puck?!\" is a non-vegan, triple milled soap with ingredients of: Potassium Palmate, Sodium Palmate, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Stearate, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Glycerin, Aqua, Parfum (Fragrance), Palm Kernel Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate Caprate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Lanolin, Pentasodium Pentatate, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Geraniol. The soap is firm and care should be taken to load heavily due to the lack of water in the soap. The lather will require additional work and the slow addition of water but when dialed in will resemble whipped cream. It has high volume and mid density. Both primary and residual slickness are entirely average. Post shave is marginal and the need for a post shave product is present due to the soap base not providing any hydration. Given my experience with the \"What The Puck?!\" soap base, the ShaveScore it receives is a 70. Similarly performing soap bases are: Fine Accoutrements (triple milled) and Uncle Jon’s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - RazoRock \"What The Puck?!\" Orange Sunrise (PIF)\n* Brush - Elite Razor Disco Taylor (purchased)\n* Razor - Rex Supply Co. Ambassador (loaner)\n* Post - Stirling Soap Co. Satsuma (gift)",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

I'll talk about the scent more later as this wasn't my focus it was the base itself. \n\n When we think France for shaving we think of the classics, [Martin de Candre](https://www.martin-de-candre.com/en/), [La Savonnière du Moulin](https://la-savonniere-du-moulin.com/), [Le Père Lucien](https://www.leperelucien.com/), and other similar brands. What most of these have in common except for LPL is that they are hard triple milled vegan base soaps, where LPL is a much softer artisan style soap in some various bases. E&S is more like a traditional artisan tallow base with goat's milk, lanolin and other butters, their base is as followed: \n\n> Ingredients: Potassium Stearate, Caprae Lac, Glycerin, SodiumStearate, Potassium Shea Butterate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Safflowerate, Potassium Castorate, Parfum, Persea Gratissima Oil, Sodium Tallowate, Cocos Nucifera Fruit Extract, Sodium Shea Butterate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Cocoa Butterate, Sodium Castorate Potassium Cocoate, Silk Powder, Stearic Acid, Potassium Lanolate, Sodium Cocoate, Allantoin, Sodium Lanolate, Tocopherol, Adeps Bovis, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao Seed Butter, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuos Seed Oil, Cocianthus Annuus Seed Oil Nucifera Oil, Lanolin, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\n------\n\n**Loading & Lathering**\n\nThis soap took a bit to load, it could have been the brush I was using the tips were too soft, took a few seconds longer but got the brush loaded fine. Maybe some scrubbier tips would grab the soap easier but minor things people. \n\nThe lathering portion took a bit longer to get to where I wanted to but a few extra seconds of patience while properly hydrating lead to a very dense and heavy lather with a high water tolerance, I could have pushed it more but no need in my eyes. \n\n**The Shave**\n\nI had 3 days of growth and my straight just wiped away the hair like nothing on the first pass. The lather is plenty slick for straights and for our DE users would have plenty of protection and cushioning. A 2 pass shave and some extra clean up left my face with a very nice DFS shave, BBS is impossible for me. The residual slickness felt very nice and good for clean up spots if needed. \n\n**The Splash**\n\nThe splash is pretty simple with the ingredients as followed:\n\n> Alcohol Denat., Hamamelis Virginiana, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Parfum, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Coumarin, Limonene, Eugenol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Methyl 2-Octyonate.\n\nI got a pretty big bite from it, not sure if it was the alcohol or scent but after 10 min my face was smooth and comfortable. It didn't have that super soft and tacky feel like some soaps and splashes give but it was just normal as the best way I can put it. \n\n**The Scent**\n\nI'm not going to focus on this much as I just cared about the base more, but Zenith is a warm floral scent, they describe it as: \n\n> The floral and spicy notes of ZENITH will bring you softness and well-being while leaving your skin delicately scented long after its application. Balanced fragrance, breath of freshness at the top with bergamot, the heart is warmed with enveloping notes of iris, jasmine and rose, and a base marked by the imprint of vanilla and the roundness of woody notes.\n \nTo me it was like a cousin of [Mickey Lee Soapworks - Bodhisattva](https://trythatsoap.com/collection/835/?product_type=soap). This scent isn't quite for me so will sell it.\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nSimply put the best artisan soap out of France and a really good EU artisan base too, scents are different with a solid variety. I would personally ignore the splash if buying a soap, it's more than the soap and I don't think as good, but if you want to get it get it. But I wouldn't hesitate to try the soap new or used. \n\n**Disclaimer**: I already said it, bought it on the BST.",

    "body": "La Roche Posay’s Cicaplast Mains is a hand cream (sold in Europe and Canada), but lately I’ve been using it on my face as an occlusive with great results.\n\nIt comes out as an ointment similar to petrolatum-based products (Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe Ointment, etc.) but when it glides on, the effect is much less shiny than petrolatum and much less tacky as well. It also has somewhat of a pore-minimizing effect (probably on account of the dimethicone). When I wear this, my skin becomes so bouncy and plumped and moist, and it stays that way all day—signatures of a good occlusive!\n\nI highly recommend this as an alternative to petrolatum if you don’t like slug-lyfin’. This works especially well as a day occlusive. I don’t find I need to use additional lotion/cream under it either, since it’s “hydrating” (water + glycerin humectant) and emollient (fatty alcohols and shea butter)—so this is a 3-in-1 product for me. Bonus: It has 4% niacinamide!\n\n(Side note: I’m prone to breakouts and this has not exacerbated any problems for me. I’m one of those unfortunate people who get closed comedones from CeraVe-in-the-tube and CeraVe PM, so this may be worth trying if you’re in the same boat.)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nAQUA / WATER\n\nGLYCERIN\n\nBUTYLENE GLYCOL\n\nCETEARYL ALCOHOL\n\nNIACINAMIDE\n\nGLYCERYL STEARATE\n\nBUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER\n\nDIMETHICONE\n\nPEG/PPG-18/18 DIMETHICONE\n\nGLYCERYL STEARATE SE\n\nSODIUM POLYACRYLATE\n\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPHENOXYETHANOL\n\n[(Product page)](https://www.laroche-posay.ca/en/cicaplast-mains/3337872414145.html)",

    "body": "So I just discovered that Nivea did the unforgivable crime of reformulating their classic bestseller - their body milk in light blue bottle with Shea butter and almond-y scent. It’s called the Nivea Pampering Soft Milk (VERWÖHNENDE SOFT MILK) in the light blue bottle. it’s also called:\nNivea Smooth Sensation Body Soft Milk or Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion, depending on the country. The formula for all those three names is the same, I’ve checked (after going down this rabbit hole), and the colour of the bottle is the same. \n\nAnd if you are in the US, then the formula for a similarly-looking Nivea body lotion in the light blue bottle (which in the US is called Nivea Shea Nourish Body Lotion) is different from both old and new European formulas for the same product 😩 the old European formula is better, the US formula is much simpler (but should work in a humid climate where people don’t need as much moisture). \n\nback to European formulas:\n\nApparently, they’ve also reformulated their other body milks/body lotions, both in deep blue colour bottle and in the white bottle (which is why those products no longer work for my skin 😩). \n\nThe new formula isn’t as hydrating and occlusive as the old one (even though the new formula claims to give hydration for 72 hours, the old one was better). Basically, the old formula has a richer feel, stays longer on the skin and locks-in moisture better, for longer period of time bc it had stronger occlusives and emollients. But as the result, it was a bit tugging on the skin and took a few minutes to absorb. The new formula absorbs immediately,  is easier to apply but is less hydrating. And it now contains denatured alcohol (at least in the light blue and white bottles). So, if you live high humidity and have normal, combo or slightly dry skin, you probably will be okay with the new formula. But if you live in dry air or have extremely dry skin, then you probably would prefer the old formula. \n\nfor years the old Nivea Body Milk in light blue was my holy grail. Nothing could beat it. Even Lipikar or Vaseline Body Lotion weren’t strong enough for my skin. Nivea was the only lotion that would actually keep my skin moisturised for an entire day, without being too thick, too greasy, too difficult to apply or too slow absorbing. And now it’s gone 😢 \n\nFortunately, you can still find the old formula on Amazon and in some online stores who are still selling the leftover stock. The new formula has words 72 h  on the packaging. The old formula would say 5 in 1, 48 h. The old formula is still officially available in Ghana and some other markets around the world but in EU, UK, Ukraine it seems to be officially discontinued (so only can be found in old stock). \n\nIf you are curious about the formulas, here are all of the them: \n\nThe old European formula for Nivea light blue body milk/lotion: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C15-19 Alkane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum (this formula should be saved in some museum of skincare and studied by chemists bc it’s so good).\n\nThe new European formula for the same product: \n\nAqua,Glycerin,Alcohol Denat.,Cetearyl Alcohol,Ethylhexyl Cocoate,Glyceryl Stearate SE,Butyrospermum Parkii Butter,Isopropyl Palmitate,Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil,Sodium Hyaluronate,Tocopherol,Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil,Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate,Glyceryl Stearate hydroxypropyl starch phosphate, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerine, phenoxyethanol, linalool, limonene, benzyl alcohol, perfume.\n\nThe US version of the product: \n\nWater, Mineral Oil, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, C15-19 Alkane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nI’ve also found this version in the Polish market (but they have both the new and the old European formulas, too) - this is one is quite close to the OG formula in terms of the level of hydration and occlusion but less cosmetically-elegant, heavier, waxier, a bit slower to absorb and a bit more difficult to spread: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, C1316 Isoparaffin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Glucoside, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Linalool, Limonene, Hydroxyisohexyl 3Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, AlphaIsomethyl Ionone, Citral, Geraniol, Parfum.\n\nThe closest thing to the old formula that I’ve found so far is their new Nivea Irresistibly Smooth Body Cream in the light blue jar. The formula is different, slightly less hydrating but close enough. It should be more fast absorbing and easier to apply: \n\nGlycerin, Mineral Oil, Alcohol Denat., Stearyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Microcrystalline Wax, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, Myristic Acid, Arachidic Acid, Oleic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Citronellol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, BHT, Fragrance. - \n\nit’s not available in all countries, only in some. \nThe Polish regional variant is also close to the OG body milk formula but is less cosmetically elegant. \n\nSo since I now know these things, I had to share it with you 😂\n\n",

I had the cream a few years ago and found it more occlusive than Lipikar, so the balm should work even better.",

It can be bought in Müller only (it's their store brand), costs €3.95 for 30ml (a little goes a long way), and comes in an airless pump container (yay). It's also fragrance free and without fatty alcohols. My skin is sensitive, prone to breakouts, and a little on the dry side. I've had breakouts from many frequently recommended moisturizers (like Cerave in the tub, The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors), but this one really works great for me. I find the texture quite light, it sinks right in, doesn't feel greasy at all despite containing olive oil and shea butter. My skin feels super moisturized and it doesn't feel like there's moisturizer just sitting on top. It leaves a slight dewy finish on my skin, which I like. It also works really well under makeup and sunscreen, feels kind of like a primer, and in fact I've stopped using primers because this works just as well if not better for me. \n\nIngredients:\n\nAQUA, POLYGLYCERYL-6 STEARATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, COCO-CAPRYLATE, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE GLYCERIDES, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL, ALLANTOIN, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED OIL, TOCOPHEROL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CARBOMER, XANTHAN GUM, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PANTOLACTONE, CITRIC ACID",

    "body": "Not technically an offer because it looks like that's the actual RRP, but I found [this cleansing milk on Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/products/sainsburys-source-of-nature-cleansing-milk-white-tea-shea-butter) and thought it looked really interesting. I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ££ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it’s in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's £2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too. So pleased to see a budget skincare line formulated with care, and it's so cool that they made them fragrance-free so anybody can try them!\n\n**Source of Nature Cleansing Milk White Tea & Shea Butter:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbitan Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Squalane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycine Soja Oil, Disodium EDTA, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Polysorbate 60, Tocopherol, Citric Acid*\n\n**Source of Nature Facial Wash:**\n\n*Aqua, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Glycine Soja Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Tocopherol, Chloroacetic Acid*\n\nYou can find the rest of the product's on [Sainsbury's website](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchDisplayView?catalogId=10241&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=44&amp;krypto=%2FDRH%2BBsB4VVnkVm97G%2F8Mu8Bsx8j7NduAzxTe1ccgua5bGLF7lGU%2BINmM35%2B2Ncnumxpqa4cpZzK5G09peKvec46DINkM8jgRfYq%2FEK425jsHdBj5D%2FUSC1VzkdVHP3hM1%2BNZeRNnNz1owO8jHWT9E4cAhUumZ09bC0tuezO4nygeWTndXU%2FwOhCaWRr7qtwdGBbzetv5jrKnyz0vTzNkg%3D%3D), the full INCIs are there.",

It's marketed for dry and atopy prone skin for both babies and adults. It costs around 6$ for 400ml. Now, my skin is normal leaning to oily but dehydrated a good bit, handles actives really well and I get maybe a couple pimples in a month, so not overly problematic. \n\n\nI'm currently in the market for a nice rich (preferably cheap) moisturizer for my PM routine and I bought this one based on the ingredients and the price, primarily for my month old big leg tattoo but it seems to me there shouldn't be any issues using it on my face as well. I put it on last night after cleansing and a HA face mist and this morning my face felt nice and nourished, no breakouts or whiteheads.\n\n\nSo my question is, what do you think about its ingredients? Do you think it could be harmful to consistently use it in on my face in the PM routine? Here's the ingredients list:\n\n\n**AQUA / WATER • GLYCERIN • PETROLATUM • PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM / MINERAL OIL • NIACINAMIDE • GLYCERYL STEARATE • CETYL ALCOHOL • PEG-40 STEARATE • BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER • CETYL PALMITATE • DIMETHICONE • ASCORBYL PALMITATE • CHLORHEXIDINE DIGLUCONATE • CITRIC ACID • CORIANDRUM SATIVUM SEED OIL / CORIANDER SEED OIL • ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM SEED OIL • GLYCINE SOJA OIL / SOYBEAN OIL • PANTHENOL • PRUNUS ARMENIACA KERNEL OIL / APRICOT KERNEL OIL • RIBES NIGRUM SEED OIL / BLACK CURRANT SEED OIL • SORBITAN TRISTEARATE • TOCOPHEROL (F.I.L.

I have started following a skincare routine 11 days ago. It was a joyous Thursday for my face that, over the course of past 30 years, has been exposed to the winds, low temperatures, a late onslaught of chicken pox, persistent hormonal acne, and results of a poor diet. I also happen to have PCOS, which makes the challenge to have clear skin extra challenging.\n\nThis is our starting point. After reading through [the Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/index) on r/SkincareAddiction, I had come up with the following routine to improve the condition of my skin:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# ROUTINE\n\n**MORNING**\n\n* Cleanser \\(Step I\\): **Bioderma Sensibio H2O micellar water** \\(applied with a cotton pad\\)\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, PEG\\-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Propylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus \\(Cucumber\\) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Bromide.\n* *Moisturiser \\(Step I\\):* **Lumene Hydration Recovery Oxygenation** **gel** **mask**\n   * *Ingredients:* Water, Propanediol, Betula Alba \\(Birch\\) Juice, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth\\-20, Phenoxyethanol, Rubus Chamaemorus \\(Cloudberry\\) Seed Extract, Acrylates/c10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Peg\\-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Trehalose, Urea, Eriophorum Spissum Flower/Stem Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium Edta, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Pentylene Glycol, Serine, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Algin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Pullulan, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbic Acid, Potassium Phosphate, Linalool, Benzyl Salicylate, Alpha\\-Isomethyl Ionone, Limonene, Citronellol, Parfum \\(Fragrance\\), \\(Ci 42090\\) Blue 1, \\(Ci 60730\\) Ext.

Other concerns include enlarged pores, rosacea in the nose area, closed comedones, and a selection of pimples.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that my face must be as dehydrated as Gobi desert out of rain season, and so my first action was to moisturise, moisturise, moisturise! At the same time, I wanted to include products meant for sensitive skin, to decrease the risk of a breakout or adverse reaction. I also tend to avoid perfumed skincare, and that was another factor when I was picking the jars and bottles.\n\nAny critique of my routine would be most welcome! Do these products work together? Is there something crucial missing? \\(I am planning on incorporating exfoliation and sunscreen next. Also, please, don't panic — I have not seen the sun in months. Years. Or so it feels.\\) Is there something I should stop using? Am I truly a happy victim of clever marketing and a corporate\\-friendly whore? \\(You betcha.\\)\n\nSo far, the result has been a more even \\(texture, not colour\\) skin with smaller pores, but, of course, this is early days.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# QUESTION\n\nA crucial point of my morning routine, and not something normally suggested for beginners, is a mask. I apply it just before I sit down to meditate. It makes sense that, while I imagine 'a steady stream of liquid sunlight' pouring through my body, I am also using that time to take care of my skin. I have found that one action triggers the other and, altogether, that is a very happy combination.\n\nI have been using the Lumene Hydration Recovery mask for the past few days, and I want to hear your suggestions for alternatives. While I did not dislike that mask, I did not feel like it was doing much for me either. Plus, it was a gift from Finland and I am in Britain, and that does not work very easily. Lastly, I would like to try a number of masks \\(and continue to discover new awesome products\\), rather than settle on a single 'meh' option.\n\nCan you help me find the mask\\(s\\)? To sum it up, I'm looking for a mask that...\n\n* Has a 10\\-15 minute application period\n* Comes in a tube or a jar \\(i.e. not a sheet mask\\)\n* Is suitable for frequent use\n* Fits my routine \\(see above\\)\n\nSuggestions of mask combinations \\(alternating masks\\) are also welcome!",

        "body": "Maskholic here, checking in. \n\nI usually do a mask everyday, it’s my favorite part of my routine. My love for masks makes me always be on the lookout for a new one and I’ve tried many out there. \n\nI’m not really a fan of sheet masks, or I haven’t tried any that has impressed me so I won’t mention those. They feel nice and are relaxing, but that’s about it. \n\nI really love Freeman’s Apple Cider Vinegar Clay mask. You can use it as a cleanser scrub or use it as a mask, I’ve only used it as a mask. I think it can be used about 2-3 times per week, so it can be used to alternate with other masks. What I like: it’s inexpensive, makes my skin feel extra soft and clean, my skin tone looks brighter even after just one use. \n\nI got this face mask kit from [Fresh at Sephora] (https://m.sephora.com/product/picture-perfect-mask-set-P424612?SKUID=1998459&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939660_pla-420369839425_1998459_257731947998_9007386_m&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CKnR1YzD3toCFYPIswodzf8JcQ&gclsrc=ds) and I absolutely love every mask that comes in it. \n\nThe Umbrian Clay Mask I find really improves the appearance of pores, blackheads/white heads. It feels good and relaxing to have it on. It says to use for up to 5 minutes, but I always start doing stuff and end up using it for longer. I find this mask is nice to use as a “premask” for the Rose or Black Tea mask. I only do this about once a week, when I’m feeling fancy. \n\nThe Rose mask feels like heaven on your skin. It has this nice cooling feeling and I find it to be very hydrating, and it makes my skin look supple and radiant. \n\nThe Black Tea mask says to use 2-3 times per week. It tingles very intensely for the first minute, but after that it feels fine.  I find this mask seems to even the texture of my skin somewhat (I’ve only used it once so far). \n\nI’ve also tried FAB Ginger Turmeric Jelly Mask. I like this one better as I love the cooling jelly on my skin. I find that it gives my skin a nice radiant glow. You can use it up to 3 times per week. I tried FAB’s bouncy mask too (a sample) and I wouldn’t buy it because I didn’t see any difference and it didn’t feel as good as the other masks I love. \n\nClinique Pep Start Bubble Mask. This is a fun mask to use in the morning as you don’t have to leave it on for long. I like the bubbling effect, it makes my skin feel extra clean and revitalized. I’ve only used this 2 times in some samples I got. \n\nBoscia Luminizing black masks. I really love this one as I find it to be very clarifying, and helps with the appearance of pores. I love peeling it off, it’s so fun and i feel like it takes so much with it. \n\nI have a few others in my cabinet that I haven’t tried yet, but I’ll report back when I do.",

I don’t even have to follow up with an oil! I use niacinamide  in my hydrating or serum steps so I don’t need it in my moisturizer. If you want niacinamide in the moisturizer I would check out the Bioderma atoderm crème some folks love it. They also have a baume but it has no niacinamide. My reason for loving the la roche posay was the soothing nature of the thermal water and the occlusion so the avene ticks the boxes for even tho it’s pricey - well worth it with a coupon or discount on sale. Also if occlusion is very important to you I know the Uriage xemose cream and xemose oil balm are also great! I just can’t find them easily where I’m located. If you’re super dry I’d go for a baume if your combo to dry the crème could do the trick. Good luck on your search :)",

    "body": "So I’ll preface this by saying as always your mileage may vary as everyone’s skin is different and what may be someone’s skincare saviour maybe someone else’s disaster!\n\nSaying that, I am seriously impressed with the Avene Tolerance Hydra 10 Cream. My skin is combination type and of course I also have the joy of having rosacea 🙄I was going through a lengthy flare-up and my face was particularly sensitive; it felt quite sore and burny like a sunburn. My usual moisturiser (Cerave) stung and I was coming to the end of it anyway so I thought I’d try something new.\n\nI bought the Hydra 10 and I noticed even on first application my face felt calmer. It continued to calm down and after a month of using it twice daily it’s caused no irritation nor broken me out. My face feels really well moisturised (I use nothing else to moisturise) and I find I don’t need to use a ton of it. I wanted something oil-free as I find moisturisers with oil tend to feel quite heavy and suffocating on my skin but ones without oil are often way too light and don’t moisturise well enough for me. This is oil-free but moisturises beautifully. Works well under my makeup and sunscreen. \n\nI was suspicious that the lemon peel powder may cause irritation but it’s been fine!\n\nSince using it my face has been flaring up less (may be a coincidence)  but I can definitely say it’s a keeper in any case.\n\nThe ingredients are:\n\nAVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. GLYCERIN. BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER). CETEARYL ALCOHOL. CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE. CITRUS LIMON (LEMON) PEEL POWDER (CITRUS LIMON PEEL POWDER). DIUTAN GUM. SCLEROTIUM GUM. SODIUM HYALURONATE\n\nJust wanted to post a review on it as it may help someone out there. I know the frustrating struggle we can have with skincare! ",

I resorted to using a different spf cream (Vichy) just under my eyes and on my forehead, and this one as far as possible from my eyes. That worked, but it was annoying to have to do that. Eventually I just stopped wearing it altogether, now it serves as a backup cream.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I’m still at a loss, probably because I just don’t quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I’m sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn’t find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I’ve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I’m hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It’s A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I’ve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there’s a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I’ve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don’t despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn’t feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I’m using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn’t go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don’t think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

I think 5% or *maybe* 10% is the sweet spot as this will be a face cream and it seems higher percentages are used largely on hardened or calloused skin.\n\n**Eucerin Replenishing Face Creme** seems like a good choice.  5% urea, first ingredient is water so it looks hydrating and has some lactic acid.  Fragrance-free, non comedogenic and apparently listed as a light moisturizer.  $9.4 an ounce.\n\n-  Aqua, Urea, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Triisostearin, Cetyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Glyceryl Stearate, Benzyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Stearate, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Methylparaben, Lactic Acid, Lanolin Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Eucerin Complete Repair Moisturizing Lotion**.  Now this is meant for body use, but...  it looks so similar.  5% urea, some ceramide-3.  NMFs and Gluco-glycerol.  Water is first ingredient again so should be moisturizing.  Fragrance free as well.  Here's the real selling point $1.5/oz.\n\n-  Aqua, Glycerine, Ureum, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Glucoside, Cyclomethicone, Sodium Lactate, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Methylpropanediol, Octyldodecanol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Tapioca Starch, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Carnitine, Ceramide-3, Sodium PCA, Arginine HCL, Serine, Alanine, Histidine, Citrulline, Lysine, Lactic Acid, Sodium Chloride, Dimethiconol, Glycogen, Mannitol, Sucrose, Glutamic Acid, Threonine, Chondrus Crispus, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol\n\nI guess I'd love any guidance on either lotion.

It's moisturizing enough for me that I think it's a little much for twice a day and will be using toleraine fluid in the mornings and the eucerin at night once my new bottle comes in. \n\nThe main difference I can see between the two you mention seems to be that the one designed for faces has silicones, so your face would feel nice and soft and smooth after using it (I've got no idea about the other ingredients in the body one, sorry). \n\nThings designed for dry skin on the body tend to be greasy, so there could be a real difference in how your skin feels and looks after putting each of them on, and might affect the way your makeup sits if you wear it.

I started using them up in the interest of not wasting products and found that... I really love them? Slathering a stick on my face is, freakishly enough, a joy for me, the eye stinging is far less of a concern, there's no product to desperately spread around my face before drying, and the sticks are small and portable. I'm mainly using the Matas one right now--the mix of Uvinul A Plus, avobenzone, and Tinosorb S is a fairly rare gem, I find. I'm happy to review the other sticks in the comments as I use them more.\n\nMy one concern is UVA protection, but given the dearth of good options in the US, I'm totally happy using these for now. If anyone has any insight into sunscreen stick UVA coverage in general, I'd love to know more.\n\nFor those concerned, the mild grease factor of the Matas is either on par or better than with creams. I personally don't care because it's not an outrageous problem when Bioderma Family Milk exists, and also fuck customers, but powder users will probably want to bust it out for this one. The [Matas Sun Face SPF50](https://nordicexpatshop.com/ENG/matas-sun-face-spf50) is maybe even greasier than the stick, and it pills like nothing else I've ever tried. I'm using a stick to be lazy--I just cannot do sunscreen gymnastics in the morning.

Im sure that the ingredients above the ceramides make up at least 99,5% of the product. No way they can produce a high concentration ceramide product for 2,49€ in a 200ml bottle!! If the concentration was very high they would write the percentage on the bottle and market the sh*t out of it. But I 100% understand why that ingredient list def got your attention. It got mine aswell. That sad thing being said I would still say that it is on surface level a good ceramide product for such a low price!\n\nAnd tbh this ingredient list def is this way to make the impression that it contains a lot of ceramides. There are sooo many ingredients behind it and for example shea butter next to it doesnt make \"logical\" sense. In a way that the amount of Shea butter must be very(!) tiny for it to come up after the Ceramides and ingredients in such a low dose wont do anything.\n\nAlso it could be something else entirely!! I heard it one time and im really not 1000% sure. Someone might proof me wrong. But I heard there is a loop hole for the order of the ingredient list, where you can place an ingredient on the ingredient list NOT based on the amount in the product, if the percentage of said ingredient is very very very low. So maybe the amount of ceramides is sooo low that they could just place it further in the front.",

I have low porosity hair down to my chest, gets oily quickly although I’ve been brushing and no-pooing like a champion for more than a year now. I figured I need to clarify from time to time to get the build up out and not rely on the brushing promoted by no-poo so much. I went no-poo for ecological reasons and do not want to compromise on my zero waste statute for my hair care, so I’m a bit limited in products. \n\nI have a natural hair soap bar and wondered if any of you know if those ingredients are okay or too harsh/to mild? \n\nThat’s the ingredients listed: Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Brassica Campestris Seed Oil, Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Spinacia Oleracea Leaf Powder, Citral, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Backhousia Citridora Leaf Oil\n\nI’m also in the process of buying a natural conditioner bar that is “curly gurl approved”, any tips on that (located in Europe)? Or is it okay for wavy hair to have Sodium Coco-Sulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol in a conditioner? \n\nAlso, what do you do to train your hair to clump? I observed that I always feel the urge to brush them out when they’re almost dry because the stringy-ness of my waves makes me look super greasy and just ughhh and I can’t stand it for another hour (my hair needs about 6h to air dry after gently scrunching out the excess with a t-shirt).  \n\nThanks for your help in advance!",

Has a gel like texture. None of them shall work for dry skin. Although, it didn't cause any issue to us, i am stating to ignore it because first it's price point, its priced too much for what you shall be achieving, second is fragrance and it may irritate your skin due to this reason as you said yours is acne prone.",

    "body": "So I bought the creamy eye treatment with avocado from Kiehl’s a couple of days ago because my under eyes were very dry. \nAfter a couple of days I noticed it was getting worse and decided to take a look at the ingredient list (lol the only time I didn’t inspect it BEFORE buying a product) and saw there is ISODECYL SALICYLATE in it. I googled this ingredient and apparently it’s just salicylic acid.. my skin reacts badly to it every single time. \nNow my question is what would be the benefit of having a BHA in an eye cream for such a delicate area? Please correct me if I am wrong. Also does anyone have experience with returning something to kiehls? (Europe) \n\nHere’s the full ingredient list:\n\nAQUA / WATER\nBUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER\nBUTYLENE GLYCOL\nTRIDECYL STEARATE\nISODECYL SALICYLATE\nPEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE\nTRIDECYL TRIMELLITATE\nPERSEA GRATISSIMA OIL / AVOCADO OIL\nISOCETYL STEAROYL STEARATE\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL\nDIPENTAERYTHRITYL HEXACAPRYLATE/HEXACAPRATE\nSORBITAN SESQUIOLEATE\nMAGNESIUM SULFATE\nPHENOXYETHANOL\nHYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL\nSODIUM PCA\nOZOKERITE\nMETHYLPARABEN\nTOCOPHERYL ACETATE\nISOPROPYL PALMITATE\nDISODIUM EDTA\nCOPPER PCA\nBUTYLPARABEN\nETHYLPARABEN\nPROPYLPARABEN\nZEA MAYS OIL / CORN OIL\nBETA-CAROTENE",

In fact if you can find it in a slightly higher percentage, it has (very) small exfoliating properties, helping to rid the dry rough skin of eczema. IMO, one of the best moisturizers for skin like yours, and the fact that you know the percentage is just gravy (so many products just list it as a good NMF but don’t both to show how much or little of it is in the formula).

Extremely fair skintone. Acne prone, dry in some spots but also very oily in others. Dehydrated for sure. Eczema prone in the past but not recently. Sensitive in general. \n\nAll the products are overwhelming to me, so I need a routine and I need products. **I will NOT be trying out all these new products at the same time.** I'll start with a new moisturizer and go on from there. I'd rather ask for help before buying anything though! Hopefully you can enlighten me a bit :)\n\n_________\n\n\n**Moisturizer**\n\nI preferable need something for both mornings and evenings (trying to limit the number of products I use) so it should moisturize me, not make me greasy and if at all possible go well under make-up. \n\nMy coworker is going to the US this month and is getting me CeraVe from the tub, yay! However, I really need one right now, and I need one that I can keep buying when it runs out. CeraVe is just for me to try out, but I probably won't be able to get it frequently :( So my search continues. These are the options I've considered so far:\n\n\n* [Avène Hydrance Optimale Riche](http://www.avene.co.uk/face/products-for-daily-use/dehydrated-skin/hydrance-optimale-rich) - The Light (Legere) one is also an option but reviews say it doesn't moisturize enough. \n\n> AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA) MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM) GLYCERIN PPG-15 STEARYL ETHER CYCLOMETHICONE CETEARYL ALCOHOL CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL) GLYCERYL STEARATE PEG-100 STEARATE BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA BUTTER) (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER) CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE BENZOIC ACID BETA-SITOSTEROL BHT C13-14 ISOPARAFFIN CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE CHLORPHENESIN DISODIUM EDTA FRAGRANCE (PARFUM) GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SEED EXTRACT (GLYCINE SOJA SEED EXTRACT) HYDROGENATED COCO-GLYCERIDES LAURETH-7 LECITHIN PEG-32 PEG-400 PHENOXYETHANOL POLOXAMER 188 POLYACRYLAMIDE SODIUM CHONDROITIN SULFATE SODIUM HYDROXIDE WATER (AQUA) XANTHAN GUM\n\n\nThe alcohol bothers me, but I've previously had great experiences with Avène... However, there's also parfum in it. Low on the list, but still...\n\n\n* [La Roche Posay Hydreane Light](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Hydreane/Hydreane-Light-p6266.aspx). I'm worried this might not be moisturizing enough for the evenings, therefore also considering [La Roche Posay Hydreane Rich](http://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Hydreane/Hydreane-Rich-p6264.aspx) but I've read this might make you greasy. \n\n\n>AQUA / WATER\nGLYCERIN\nCYCLOHEXASILOXANE\nHYDROGENATED POLYISOBUTENE\nAMMONIUM POLYACRYLDIMETHYLTAURAMIDE / AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE\nMYRISTYL MYRISTATE\nSODIUM HYDROXIDE\nSTEARIC ACID\nPOLYPHOSPHORYLCHOLINE GLYCOL ACRYLATE\nXANTHAN GUM\nCAPRYLOYL GLYCINE\nCAPRYLYL GLYCOL\nACRYLATES COPOLYMER\nPOTASSIUM CETYL PHOSPHATE\nGLYCERYL STEARATE SE\n\nNot too set on either Avène or LRP, but they are OK in price range (I guess... I'd rather go cheaper but I'm desperate) and readily available for me.\n\n____________\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\nIt needs to be a physical/mineral sunscreen as chemical ones irritate my eyes. SPF doesn't need to be crazy high - Netherlands.\n\nI need help here honestly. I have so much trouble finding one. The top one right now seems to be my fav because it's cheap and I can get it anywhere. If it sucks I won't be too sad...\n\n\n* [Eart Line Argan Bio Sun Face Age Control](http://www.vannaturebeter.nl/biosunfaceagecontrole.html) (SPF 15 but they also have SPF 20)\n\n>Aqua, Macadamia Ternifolia (macadamia oil)**, Titanium Dioxide, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin (soy), Helianthus Annus (sunflower oil)**, Simmondsia Chinensis ( jojoba oil)**, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter)** , Prunus Dulcis (almond oil)**,Stearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Oil (argan oil)**, Cocos Nucifera (coconut oil)**, Chlorella Vulgaris/Lupinus, Albus Protein Ferment, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract (anti-dark spots), Porphyra Umbilicalis / Porphyra Umbilicalis Extract (red algae), Calendula Officinalis Extract **, Symphytum Officinale Extract (comfrey)**, Plantago Lanceolata Extract (plantain)**, Zinc Oxide, Fragrance (natural perfume)**, Aloe Barbadensis (aloe vera)**, Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10), D-alpha Tocopherol (vitamin E), Daucus Carota (vitamin A), Camellia Sinensis (white tea), Squalane, Ascorbyl Palmitate (vitamin C),  Sucrose Stearate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-2 Caprate, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Xanthan Gum, Glyceryl Caprylate, Aluminium Stearate, Phytic acid, Citric Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Isostearic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Citronellol*, Limonene*, Linalool*, Farnesol*, Geraniol*\n\nYou probably haven't heard of this one, I think it's a European brand. Hopefully you can glance something from the ingredients that I can't. Sorry for the editing, they put stars next to some ingredients which makes it bold, but I don't know what the stars mean :)\n\nI like this one because it's a physical sunscreen, SPF 20 seems fine enough for me, it's not expensive and I can buy it in many stores around here. Not too fond of the alcohol in this one again, but maybe I shouldn't be bothered so much? \n\n* [Paula's Choice RESIST Super Light Daily Wrinkle Defense SPF 30](http://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-super-light-daily-wrinkle-defense-spf-30.html) - Or maybe not this one specifically as I don't like the coloring. Paula's Choice seems to have many SPF creams though. \n\n\nOther PC's options are also in my mind. I don't know. I've never used anything from PC. Everyone seems really happy with it and considering the trouble I have finding a good mineral sunscreen, I'm willing to try it. Definitely above my budget to be honest though...\n\n____________\n\n**Exfoliant**\n\nPaula's Choice, no doubt really. Can't seem to find another one that's cheaper and with all the positive responses I'm willing to spend the money on it. BHA Regular probably. *Not starting this until I have the rest of my routine sorted out though!*\n\n____________\n\n**Cleanser**\n\nCeraVe! My coworker is also bringing me CeraVe cleanser and I can't wait to use it. Until then I'll finish the cleanser I'm using now. It's not great, but it's alright (Dutch brand). I'm really putting my money on the CeraVe for the moment and I'll wait to see what that does before I worry about it any more. Finding a good moisturizer and sunscreen is difficult (and expensive) enough for now.. But if you have any options for me, please let me know! I was told I should look for one with low PH?\n\n______\n\n\nWhat else do I need? Something that's glaringly lacking? I feel like a serum sounds wonderful, but maybe I should prioritize something else. Or maybe I should chill and see what the new products over time will do for me. I don't know. I still need advice and you guys really helped me clear my mind earlier. Thanks again everyone. You're lifesavers. ",

Personally, I only buy sunscreens which are somewhat cheap (I guess around $3-4/oz) because I go through more sunscreen than any other product.  You also have to consider how much protection you want and whether a white cast on your face will bother you or not.  Most physical sunscreens do leave a white cast, so keep that in mind.  They can be a little drying too.  I think the Earth Line could be worth a try.  Asian products tend to be cheap (although small) and ship worldwide for reasonable prices.  This [Innisfree](http://www.innisfreeworld.com/product/productView.do?prdSeq=10131) sunscreen is physical and supposed to be good.  You can get more info on which website to buy from at /r/Asianbeauty. \n\nThe cleanser should be around pH 5.5  [Sebamed](http://www.sebamed.nl/nl) is known for this!

I immediately went through the list of ingredients (below) but I don't see anything too bad?

    "body": "Hello everyone, I am new to this fungal acne as I recently discovered that it is what I have. I have only had problems for about 3 years (I am 37 years old). My problem is that I recently bought a lot of products (before I understood that I have fungal acne), and I am not well-read yet on which products are suitable or not. Below, I have a list of products that I use but am unsure if they are fungal acne safe. Some I can see are not safe, but as I said, I am not sure. Therefore, I need help with the ingredients list of these products. Which are okay and which are not okay? If some kind soul who is knowledgeable about this could just look through the list and mark \"OK\" or \"NOT OK\" on all the products, I would be so grateful so that I can sell or give away these products as they are new. \n\nTheese are the products i use:\n\n  \n**FACE MASKS**\n\n**Evolve organic beauty, bio retinol gold mask**\n\n**INCI:** Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Glycerin [\\[2\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-2)KaolinPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)MicaCi 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)SilicaCi 77491 (Iron Oxide)Sucrose LaurateRosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Perfume (Fragrance) [\\[3\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-3)Bidens Pilosa ExtractAstrocaryum Murumuru Seed ButterGossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed OilLinum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed OilCitrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Water [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Vanilla planifolia fruit oilTocopherol (Vitamin E)Sucrose StearateSucrose PalmitateTin Oxide\n\n1. from controlled organic agriculture\n2. made using natural raw ingredients\n3. from natural essential oils\n\n**Mantle, The dream mask**\n\n**INCI:** Aqua (Water), Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Leaf Extract, Bakuchiol, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Ubiquinone, Phospholipids, Sphingolipids, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Beta-Sitosterol, Squalene, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Litsea Cubeba Fruit Oil (Parfum/Fragrance), Citral, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol\n\n\n\n**La prairie, 3 min peel mask**\n\n**INCI:** water (aqua), lactic acid, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, glycolic acid, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine, polyglyceryl-3 laurate, peg-8/smdi copolymer, hexylene glycol, sodium hydroxide polyglyceryl-6 caprylate, polyglyceryl-4 caprate, salicylic acid, malic acid, hydroxyethylcellulose, glycoproteins\\*, panax ginseng root extract\\*, equisetum arvense extract\\*, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract\\*, lactobacillus ferment\\*, sucrose, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glucose, fructose, glycerin, urea, tocopheryl acetate, sodium nitrate, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, dextrin, polysorbate 60, octyldodecanol, sorbitan isostearate, sodium stearoyl glutamate, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, echium plantagineum seed oil, alanine, polyquaternium-7, tocopherol, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance (parfum), alpha-isomethyl ionone, linalool, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, titanium dioxide (ci 77891)     i75\n\n\n\n**La prairie, Luxe sleep mask**\n\n**INCI:** Water (Aqua), Propanediol, Dimethicone, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Oil, Squalane, Glycerin, Sorbitan Stearate, Jojoba Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Alcohol, Nylon-12, Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Carrageenan, Caviar Extract, Caulerpa Lentillifera Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide NP, Sodium DNA, RNA, Hydrolyzed Rice Bran Protein, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Tetrapeptide-3, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pullulan, Panthenol, Coco-Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Pantolactone, Sucrose Stearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Yeast Extract, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 60, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Red 4 (CI 14700), Blue 1 (CI 42090) i74 \\* New patent pending for la prairie’s exclusive Cellular Complex in addition to US Patent 5,840,309 \\*\\* The declaration on the packaging prevails.

    "body": "Hello r/curlyhair, this is my first post here.\n\nLately I’ve been trying to make my routine more environment-friendly (and hair- friendly!) by switching to solid shampoo. So I’ve purchased the first one that was available to me locally, which was Balade en Provence brand. On paper it seemed great - 100% vegan, ethically made in France, no harsh ingredients (list included below) and all that jazz.\n\nBut after few tries the effects are... underwhelming to say the least. Granted, I’m aware that after years of using regular shampoos, it takes some getting used to for the hair and scalp to work with milder cleaning agents and that I shouldn’t give up just yet, but I’d really love an opinion from curlies who have more experience with shampoo bars than I do. Is it my technique that’s wrong or is this shampoo just not suited for my hair?\n\nMy complaints/questions are as follows:\n\n- I can’t get the bar to lather well. I’ve tried both rubbing it against my hair and lathering it in my hands first and then putting it in my hair but in either case the foam disappears very quickly and I don’t feel like I’ve actually washed my hair clean\n\n- I’m rinsing A LOT, way more than with regular shampoo, but this one seems to make a gummy layer in my hair that doesn’t wash out with water. When it’s soaked, my hair feels nice and soft, but once it dries even a little bit, the gummy feeling returns\n\n- My hair takes much longer to air dry, but once it finally does, the length and ends are nice enough, with good definition but my roots still feel a little gummy and look stringy and flat. Not a great look, overall. I can tell that the shampoo is still there, because I can smell it when I run my hands through my hair. How the hell do I get it to rinse?\n\n- Can I still put oil in my hair before washing it with a shampoo bar? I feel like it makes all of the above effects worse.\n\n- Should I cut down on styling products? So far I can’t imagine a shampoo bar could deal with product buildup well.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated!\n\nFor reference, I have long, fine (but lots of it) 2c/3a type, medium porosity hair and the products I normally use are:\n\n- Garnier Fructis Hair Food Aloe Multi-Purpose Mask\n\n- Boots Essentials Curl Creme\n\n- Umberto Giannini scrunching jelly\n\n- Umberto Giannini Weather Proof Curls finishing cream\n\n- Organix Coconut Water, Hydration Oil for the ends\n\n- walnut oil before washing\n\nAnd the shampoo bar ingredient list:\nCocos nucifera oil, Vitis vinifera seed oil, Aqua, Sodium hydroxyde, Butyrospermum parkii butter, Brassica campestris seed oil, Limonene, Citrus nobilis peel oil, Citrus paradisi peel oil, Citrus sinensis peel oil expressed, Illite, Eugenia caryophyllus bud oil, Pinus sylvestris oil, Eugenol.",

This page explains it well: [https://ethique.com/blogs/how-to/why-are-our-bars-so-much-more-than-other-shampoo-bars](https://ethique.com/blogs/how-to/why-are-our-bars-so-much-more-than-other-shampoo-bars) . The shampoo bar you are using is basically a soap (contains sodium hydroxide) so the pH is likely way too high for your hair. I have also had this issue with Chagrin Valley shampoo bars. I would recommend trying a shampoo bar that does not have sodium hydroxide in its ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have similar hair to yours and I get good results just cowashing and using a curl cream or mousse.

    "body": "Hi there!\n\nPrior to 2021 I had perfect skin and used very standard supermarket cleansers and moisturisers without issue.\n\nHowever my skin slowly deteriorated as I tried out different products and got to the point where any cleaners or moisturiser would just burn my skin (even the ones I had been using for years) and leave it completely red and pimply (inc all the classic cetaphils, la rouche etc).\n\nThe dermatologist at the time prescribed me soolantra and told me to just keep trying different products which I did. The soolantra worked a tiny bit though if I used it with most cleaners or moisturisers my face would still have the same reaction and look terrible.\n\nDuring this time I finally found 2 products that did not make face burn or give me any kind of reaction which I was thrilled about; because of this I was able to compile a spreadsheet of all the ingredients for all the products i'd previously tried and compare them with these 2 products and realised the only difference was that everything else had Cetearyl Alcohol in them and the 2 products that didn't make me react did not contain this.\n\nThese products were;\n\nCleanser: Lumin Charcoal Face Wash  \nCorrector: Lumin Instant Redness Corrector.\n\nSkip forward a year to now and while these products are fine, my skin isn't perfect, it's like it's crying out for a proper moisturiser but every single thing I try in this department gives me a reaction.  \n  \nI've recently tried a few Paula's Choice Moisturisers (making sure they don't contain Cetearyl Alcohol of course) and while I'm not getting an extreme reaction I feel like there's something still in there that makes my skin look a bit worse for wear afterwards.  \n  \nMy first question is; from the list below (Paula's Choice Resist Barrier Repair Advanced Moisturiser) what would still be giving me a slight reaction? Are some of these also alcohol's under a different name? I felt like based on the ingredient list this would be fine.  \n  \nAnd if so, will I just have a reaction and not be able to heal/fix my skin as everything contains some kind of alcohol?  \n  \nThank you so much if you read this far, any help would be really, really appreciated.  \n  \n \n\n||\n||\n|Water⁠,|\n|Dicaprylyl Carbonate|\n|Ethylhexyl Stearate|\n|Glycerin|\n|Cocoglycerides|\n|Squalane|\n|Sodium Polyacrylate|\n|Butyrospermum Parkii Butter|\n|Ceramide NP|\n|Ceramide AP|\n|Ceramide AS|\n|Ceramide NS|\n|Ceramide EOP|\n|Sodium Hyaluronate|\n|Adenosine|\n|Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5|\n|Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Seed Oil|\n|Glyceryl Stearate|\n|Caprylyl Glycol|\n|Hydroxyacetophenone|\n|Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate|\n|Hexylene Glycol|\n|Tocopherol|\n|2,3-Butanediol|\n|Xanthan Gum|\n|Ethylhexylglycerin|\n|Sodium Phytate|\n|Sodium PCA|\n|Urea|\n|Hydrogenated Lecithin|\n|Trehalose|\n|Polyquaternium-51|\n|Triacetin|\n|Cholesterol|\n|Phenoxyethanol|\n\n",

        "body": "Most moisturizers are made up of water, alcohols, fats/oils, and wax esthers. Most products have so many ingredients that it's hard to narrow down which ones you're sensitive to.\n\n\nSorry, I can't answer your question. However, I have extremely sensitive skin and break out if I even look at product that contains an oil with a comedogenic rating higher than 1 (one). I also produce waaaaay too much oil. Here are some products that work for my skin that do not contain Cetearyl Alcohol:\n\n\nToner:\n\n\n- Dickenson's Original Witch Hazel Hydrating Toner with Rose Water (Alcohol free)\n- First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner\n\nMoisturizer:\n\n\n- First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Oil-Control Moisturizer\n- First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Oat & Hemp Seed Dry Oil\n\nEye Cream:\n\n\n- First Aid Beauty Hydrating Eye Cream with Hyaluronic Acid\n\n\nSerum:\n\n- First Aid Beauty Bounce Boosting Serum\n- Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex Serum\n\nExfoliator:\n\n\n- First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads\n- Naturium BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2%\n\n\nAnother thing you might consider is applying a non-comedogenic oil with a rating of zero or one after your water-based moisturizer has absorbed into your skin. My whole life I was told not to use oil on my face because of my acne. One day I decided to go against that advice and it did wonders for my skin. Hemp oil is a zero on the comedogenic scale and does a great job, even though it stinks a bit. My personal favorite oil combo is argan oil with a drop of squalane.\n\n\nSorry you're on the skincare struggle bus. I hope you find something that works for you!",

There are still alcohols and synthetic components in these.\n\nYou’re starting from too complicated of a controlled perspective. You say you wish to determine what ingredients are subjectively preferred by yourself, and I doubt even the most oil-affluent human on the planet would be able to independently judge each of these 10 ingredients in each bottle. Too much combination happening at once. \n\nAdvice:\nIf you can’t pronounce an ingredient, don’t use it. If you were to use your own judgement system and be successful with finding the right oils, you’d be using natural stuff in the end. Save yourself the time now. \n\nIt was said before, but stay simple. Use your classic base oils, a little essential, and added vitamin E if you’d like. Parfume and Fragrance typically refers to alcohol-based, and you don’t want that on your skin or hair. \n\nSpend $50-75 on amazon and you’ll be able to make yourself quality beard oil for at least a few months.",

    "body": "Long story short I am new to actually caring for my skin and am needing some help. I used to cleanse and sometimes moisturize only. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am allergic to everything under the sun from plants, animals, mold, dust, foods, and chemicals. I've had pretty extensive allergy testing done at the doctor. Tested \"positive\" for 60 of 60 \"natural\" allergens (I reacted to all plants, pollen, animals, mold). I reacted to the tape done for the chemical test, so that has to be redone. I have not yet done the food allergy test. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as chemicals go, I know for sure I am allergic to Stearyl Alcohol. I have also decided to try to avoid Cetyl Alcohol and thus Cetearyl Alcohol (Cetyl and Stearyl alcohols combined). I also prefer fragrance free or very low fragrance/odor (due to other allergies and migraine triggers)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have combonation skin, leaning towards dry. I get very flaky skin easily (it will peel off in patches or sheets). I also have relatively sensitive skin, turning red very quickly and also breaking out into hives, rashes, and contact dermatitis. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is my current skin care routine with products I use with a link to the product and the ingredient list. (the links are just generic to sephora mostly because that is where i bought these products)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I am wanting help with a few things\n\n1. are all of the products i have listed safe from the above alcohols?\n2. Is this the right order?\n3. do I need to add or subtract anything from my routine?\n4. any other suggestions or advice?\n5. several product replacements i need\n   1. eye cream\n   2. exfoliate \n   3. lotion!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will update later with my makeup list, but one step at a time.

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: This product, verified by the EWG, generally does not cause significant problems for children, and can be a good option for many parents. This baby lotion contains mostly beneficial ingredients such as plant oils and extracts which provide moisture and soothe the skin. The inclusion of Avena Sativa Kernel Flour (oatmeal) and Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract can be particularly beneficial for sensitive skin. Tocopheryl Acetate, a form of Vitamin E, provides antioxidant benefits. However, Cetyl Alcohol, though generally mild, can occasionally cause skin irritation in very sensitive individuals. The preservative system with Caprylhydroxamic Acid and Glyceryl Caprylate is gentle and less likely to cause reactions. Xanthan Gum is a safe thickening agent but might cause issues if your baby is allergic. Always do a patch test before using it extensively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**  Water, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Spiraea Ulmaria Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Emulsifying Wax\n   * Emulsifying Wax is a common ingredient in many types of creams and lotions, including baby lotion. It's used to help mix oil and water, creating a smooth, creamy texture. This allows the product to evenly spread and absorb into the skin. Generally, emulsifying wax is considered to be safe for topical use and is not associated with severe side effects. However, like any ingredient, it may cause problems for certain individuals.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some rare cases, emulsifying wax can cause skin irritation. This can result in redness, itchiness, or a slight burning sensation. This is more common in people with sensitive skin.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though very rare, some individuals might have an allergic reaction to emulsifying wax. This could lead to more severe skin redness, swelling, itchiness, hives, and in the most severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Clogged Pores: Depending on the type of emulsifying wax used and the individual's skin type, there may be a risk of clogged pores, which can lead to breakouts. However, this is less likely with baby lotions, which are typically formulated to be gentle and non-comedogenic.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tocopheryl Acetate\n   * Tocopheryl Acetate, also known as Vitamin E Acetate, is a form of Vitamin E that is often used in skincare products and cosmetics, including baby lotion. It acts as an antioxidant and skin-conditioning agent. While Tocopheryl Acetate is generally considered safe for use in skincare products, some people may experience side effects, particularly if they have sensitive skin or a specific allergy to the ingredient.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience minor skin irritation when using products containing Tocopheryl Acetate. This can manifest as redness, itching, or dryness.\n      * Allergic Reaction: Though it's rare, some individuals may have an allergic reaction to Tocopheryl Acetate. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include severe skin redness, swelling, hives, and in severe cases, difficulty breathing.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing Tocopheryl Acetate comes into direct contact with the eyes, it may cause eye irritation.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

Food-grade requires a higher purity standard than cosmetic-grade oil. Most cosmetic grade oil is more expensive than even the priciest organic artisanal cooking oil, but that's all marketing. \n\nHowever, a bottle of sunflower oil doesn't have all those other ingredients so it may not have the scent and texture you prefer. But I've used coconut oil and macadamia oil as moisturisers before and would definitely recommend it.",

    "body": "**Background**:\n\nI recently decided to just toss out my old \"hair care\" routine entirely and start following the CurlyGirl method after I got fed up with how the years of bleaching, dyeing, and constant straightening had pretty much ruined my hair's texture and curl pattern. I started a pretty decent beginner routine with mostly cheap, but CG friendly products from the HG list, and in an attempt to not waste anything that I had already bought (I have a problem with impulse purchases lol) I decided to run their ingredients through curlsbot.com and found that the Sephora brand curl cream is actually CG friendly. There's several raving reviews about this cream on [Sephora's website](https://www.sephora.com/product/sephora-collection-curl-cream-P453607?skuId=2192227&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825938260_aud-764261819446:pla-420321919913_2192227_257731947827_9009783_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=CjwKCAiAu9vwBRAEEiwAzvjq--bnp9KCjkUw2a3OYsFYkaDMTmouQkPGNEgR7ZxEZJW1xgqufWL5LhoCokYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) if any of you want to do more research, but here are a couple things I have noticed since I began using it in conjunction with the CG method about two weeks ago.\n\n* It's really *really* orange. This isn't necessarily a turn off, just something I definitely was not expecting when I first opened it.\n* I've never smelled anything like it. It's got a very distinct fruity/floral scent with an almost \"minty\" undertone that literally cleared my sinuses the first time I put it in my hair and I'm addicted. If strongly scented products bother you this might not be a good choice, but I did notice that the smell fades to nothing by the time my hair dried.\n* My hair is the smoothest it has ever been. My curls usually tend to frizz up no matter how much conditioner, mousse, or gel I use but this curl cream seems to soak right into my hair and provides me with the most defined, frizz-free curls I have seen since I was like 10 years old.\n* The texture of my hair has also vastly improved in the last two weeks, I used to straighten my hair every day because it always felt coarse and gross when I let it dry naturally but now it seems like my curls are progressively getting softer and less stringy with each wash!\n* It's a bit on the pricey side ($14 for 7 oz) but that being said, I do think it is a worthwhile product to try out for sure.\n\n**My Routine** (for those curious):\n\n1. Co-wash with Botanique Nourish and Replenish.\n2. Work about a fist-full of the same conditioner into the length of my hair using the S2C method until super slippery.\n3. Detangle with a wide-tooth comb and rinse around 80% of the conditioner out.\n4. With hair soaking wet; squish in Shea Moisture raw shea butter detangler, Sephora Hair curl cream, and Herbal Essences totally twisted gel (usually about a palm full of each).\n5. Plop for the rest of my shower (about 15 mins).\n6. Unwrap my hair and add a bit of Herbal Essences totally twisted mousse to my roots for volume. Air Dry.\n7. Scrunch out the crunch for some increasingly awesome 2c/3a curly waves.\n8. Optional: Clip roots for added volume if I have extra time, or diffuse with cool air until dry if I don't.\n\n\\*Once a week I deep condition with Shea Moisture JBCO mask and I'm considering adding a bit of Colorful neutral protein filler to my conditioner once/twice a month to help with the integrity of my bleached-to-death ends.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nIf you've got a little bit of splurging money, want to try something new, and/or have noticed harshness in your texture or frizziness to your hair; then I definitely recommend giving this curl cream a shot. It smells fantastic and certainly provides some unbelievable results in the way my curls come out. I've tried doing the same routine above without the curl cream several times and I find that my final curls come out much less defined and slightly drier to the touch, especially at the ends. If anyone else has tried this product or has recommendations for another HG curl cream let me know what you think!\n\n**Ingredients**:\n\nAqua (Water), Butyrospermum Parkii Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cocos Nucifera **(Coconut) Oil**, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum (Fragrance), Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Limonene, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Trideceth-6, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Linalool, Citronellol, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), Citral, CI 15985 (Yellow 6), CI 16035 (Red 40).\n\nEdit: Added ingredients.",

Some people don't follow with another cleanser but I personally need to, to make sure I get everything off. These types of balm and oil cleansers are the bomb for removing makeup and sunscreen. I would definitely use a cloth to remove the balm, I don't see any emulsifiers so it probably wouldn't wash off well just with water.\n\n2. I wouldn't. I have no particular reason for saying this, just that it's not a product made to be left on your skin. There might be an ingredient in there that could cause problems if you do that.\n\n3. If you're not sensitive to fragrance, not that I know of. The tocopherol has the potential to be comedogenic, as do the oils, but that's a ymmv kinda thing too. I don't know anything about this emollient/skin conditioning ingredients so can't say anything about them.\n\n4. Yes. Even if you use super clean hands in the tub, it's still more hygienic imo to use a q-tip or some sort of spatula.",

I'm actually quite pleased with it. I have dry, sensitive skin, but am not acne-prone.\n\nThe Cleansing Butter feels like a bridge between OCM and cold cream. I think it really only compares to cold cream while it's in the tin. In the tin, the product is thick and waxy and looks similar to solid perfume. It's easy to swab enough out with a Q-tip and the products melts in the heat of your hand, becoming very delicate and easy to spread over your face. It's got more substance than oil, but the balmy feel is similar on your skin. Once on your face, it's silky and invisible. \n\nOn your face, it feels smooth and moisturizing. I have moderately sensitive skin and had no adverse effects. You can wipe it off with a cloth or rinse it. I dabbed it off with a cotton pad and then rinsed my face. My skin felt moisturized afterwards and probably didn't need additional cleansing, but I like the feel of a traditional cleanser and usually double cleanse when I wear makeup.\n\nMy biggest surprise was how easily it melted off mascara and eye makeup with no stinging or irritation. I was skeptical when I first used it and compared it to The Body Shop's [Camomile Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover](http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/makeup/makeup-removers/camomile-waterproof-eye-makeup-remover.aspx). I used the Cleansing Butter on one side of my face and the Waterproof Remover on the other. The Cleansing Butter got the mascara on the first try with very little residue, while the Waterproof Remover took a little more effort and rinsing to clean my lashes.\n\nI will happily continue using it and am pleasantly surprised that an impromptu purchase turned out so well.",

I’ve had problems for a few months since my holy grail moisturiser (Avene tolerance extreme) was discontinued, and they brought out a replacement formula containing SOMETHING that irritates my skin (maybe shea butter or behenyl alcohol???). The replacement formula has really bad reviews online with people saying basically the same, that it causes irritation and rashes.\n\nFor the past few months I’ve been desperately trying to find a replacement moisturiser, but pretty much everything I’ve tried seems to make matters worse, even the basic drugstore/derm favourites, so I’ve just stuck to this new version of the Avene cream, which contains: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, GLYCERIN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER (BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER), CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL), BEHENYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, WATER (AQUA). It sort of moisturises, but also seems to make my skin irritated, flaky and slightly itchy.\n\nI think my desperate attempts to moisturise and remove flakes (tried natural oils, mineral oils, glycerin, vaseline on damp skin, other French skincare like LRP, Bioderma etc, zinc soap(!!)) have just totally jacked up my skin barrier and my face is now rough like sandpaper, flaking, blotchy and pink with sore areas.\n\n I’ve managed to get my hands on a tube of the old version of my moisturiser. I’ve been using it a week but my skin looks awful still! I think I accidentally manually exfoliated a week ago when the cream arrived, as I massaged it in for ages trying to remove all the dead skin, and woke up the next morning with actual raw weepy patches. The cream contains: AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). GLYCERIN. MINERAL OIL (PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM). SQUALANE. CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS (SAFFLOWER) SEED OIL (CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS SEED OIL). CYCLOPENTASILOXANE. GLYCERYL STEARATE. CYCLOHEXASILOXANE. SODIUM CARBOMER. TITANIUM DIOXIDE. WATER (AQUA) I used it for 10 years + before it was discontinued with no problems.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I look so bad that it’s impacting my work. Does anyone know how long the skin barrier might take to improve again? Should I avoid washing? I’m so confused!\n\nThanks in advance for your advice guys :(",

YES! Allow your skin time to replenish natural oils! If you have to wash use cold water, hot water  and soap will strip your skin bare.\n\n4) Check for allergy triggers if possible, nickel, cats, plants, synthetic fabrics, fragrances, unclean pillowcases, feather pillowcases are common problems.\n\n5) Have you tried vaseline over night? It can help when you are red raw, and the looks don't matter when you are asleep. It will mostly end up on your pillowcase by morning (you can wash that to remove) and you can use a lighter moisturiser during the day.\n\nFinally, dont lose hope - good luck",

The Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating serum worked nicely but I still need a richer moisturizer. The day cream in the same line appears to have been reformulated recently: it has all the good stuff in the serum -- hyaluronic acid, ceramides + cholesterol, urea -- and it has dropped the bad ingredients it used to contain -- ceteareth-20, a.k.a. why Cerave breaks me out.

[New version](http://www.superdrug.com/Superdrug/Superdrug-Simply-Pure-Day-Cream-75ml/p/342863), by contrast, looks promising. Note the slightly different packaging, higher price, and/or ingredients if you want to go buy it in stores.\n\n**Edit #2:**  False alarm. I thought it was new (on the basis of its being labeled \"new\"...)  But when I asked after it at my local shop, they said it was no longer sold in stores but still available online. ",

    "body": "I'm a guy who only started thinking about skincare a year ago. My issue is that at warm times my skin is very greasy, but during the winter it's dry as hell, I have **a flaky T-zone**. A year ago I started buying moisturizers, but I still can't find the one that would fit me! The last few products I tried recently were a moisturizing cream and a lotion from **Cerave** and a moisturizer from **Cetaphil**. From all three moisturizers I have **closed comedones** on my forehead which go away right after I stop using these. I obviously didn't apply all of them at once, I tested one by one for a 1.5 month, the same result. This is disappointing, I don't understand why would all products that clearly say that they are tested by dermatologists and anti-acne, actually cause these problems? I don't even know how am I supposed to find anything that would fit my skin? I'm sick of throwing everything in the trash right after I bought it. I don't know why but here nobody ever gives you free testers and there are no tiny versions of a product, only full huge versions. I don't think I should give a chance to other similar brands like La-roche Posay, because I bet it will cause closed comedones just like Cerave and Cetaphil. So I guess my only choice is considering a korean market? I've been using a korean Innisfree Broccoli lotion, it never gave me any problems, but it doesn't hydrate enough, even after I apply a few layers of it, you can still see the skin flakes on my nose and forehead. But still, how should I choose a moisturizer if I don't even know which ingredient causes comedones on my forehead? Cerave and Cetaphil have a lot of the same ingredients so it's impossible to guess:\n\n**Cerave**:  AQUA / WATER, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL,  CETYL ALCOHOL, DIMETHICONE, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYSORBATE 20,  CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE,  SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE,  DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP,  PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, SODIUM  HYALURONATE, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP    \n\n\n**Cetaphil**:  Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus Seed  Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane,  Cetearyl Alcohol, Sorbitol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate,  Allantoin, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol,  Citric Acid, Dimethiconol, Disodium EDTA, Disodium Ethylene Dicocamide  PEG-15 Disulfate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Hydroxypalmitoyl  Sphinganine, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium PCA,  Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopheryl Acetate.   \n\n\n**Innisfree Broccoli** (the one that didn't cause any problems):  Water, Hydrogenated C6-14 Olefin Polymers, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl  Carbonate, Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose  Distearate, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Cyclomethicone, Cetearyl Olivate, Citrus  Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate,  Carbomer, Tromethamine, Salvia Hispanica Seed Extract,  Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Crodata Extract, Gaultheria  Procumbens Leaf Extract, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Disodium EDTA, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl  Caprylate",

I don't with this one! It's like a lip-balm just bigger, and I just run the stick around on my face and then rub it with my fingers to make sure to get it everywhere. But I don't know if I apply enough, and on the product it only says to \"apply often and especially after bathing/sweating\". I just continue until I look like a glazed donut lol.  \nOtherwise it has good ingredients and good filters, so I'm not too worried, but I just wondered if there's any tips when it comes to sunstick dosage.

I \"buffer\" it when I apply it by mixing it with a hydrating serum - either straight up HA or more recently the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence. I found when I don't mix it directly I get some dry or flaky patches, but with even that bit of padding it's okay!  \n\n\nAlso, I use Differin MAYBE 2x a week - I never escalated up. Didn't really feel like I needed to? I had sort of a rough start with a lot of purging for up to 2 months, but now my skin is really clear except for a few hormonal pimples that come up and go away much quicker! It was super worth the unpleasant part and my skin feels hardier than before. If I use it more than twice a week my face starts to feel too sensitive.\n\nFrom what I've read, you can buffer with almost any simple moisturizer so you should be find with the FAB or your Cerave. I think its better to just take it slow and listen to your skin.",

No wrinkles, tends to get oily..especially here in Florida. \n\nI typically use Cerave night cream before bed, but have used others in the past without an issue too like Eucerin. Also hyaluronic acid and a retinoid religiously. Retinoid for years...then I stopped due to a long illness and not caring. I started again about 2 months ago and went through the whole purge of peeling, red skin and back to the lovely benefits.\n\nI switched to a snail mucin night cream a month ago. I RARELY get pimples. And for the past 3 weeks, I have been getting multiples of them. As soon as I think they are healing...I wake up with a few more. I never wear makeup on my skin because I don't need to. But now, I'm getting self-cautious. I also have very fair skin, so they take a long time to heal. Even retinoid doesn't seem to stop them!\n\nHas anyone tried snail mucin and actually had issues with it? I've read tons of great things about it, but it seems like it doesn't agree with me. It's a shame, because I love the glow this cream gives me! But I hate feeling like a pubescent teenager again that has to wear concealer.

I had seen people saying that you might have a reaction if you're allergic to dust mites, but I've never had allergies/been allergic to anything, so I ignored those comments. After nothing worked, I figured I'd stop the snail mucin for a little bit to see if that was the issue - and it was! Skin cleared up within 3 months. I must've developed a dust mite allergy over the years that I never knew about.\n\nAlso - I see this product contains **shea butter & isopropyl palmitate,** which are both pore-clogging ingredients. If you don't have a dust mite allergy, those might be the ingredients breaking you out. I'd recommend checking the ingredients of all your skin products to make sure there's no pore-clogging ingredients.
