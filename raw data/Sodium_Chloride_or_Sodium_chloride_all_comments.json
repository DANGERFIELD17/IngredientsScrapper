This is vital information for our establishment to keep track of profit in order to thrive. Also, I'm sure some customers would like receipts of their order to ensure you did not miscalculate their transaction. I'm not saying you did as I am confident in your abilities dude, but the average everyday dude can not instantly prove this and may feel uncomfortable with you quoting them their change in your head. You are very smart Jimmy, but you have nothing to prove it. I just wish you can see this and to also think a little deeper on your actions, dude. !<",

This season I managed to scrape my way up into Diamond IV, mostly by always trying to play with at least one buddy when going into ranked and always using my mic, even if my random teammates weren't using theirs. I never dashboarded and I'm not even that good (1.19 lifetime k/d).\n\nI have no sympathy for the dashboarders who are gonna get chopped. Grind it out like the rest of us or face the music, simple as that.\n\n[EDIT] I'll also note that while dashboarding definitely happens in Plat, it's absolutely fucking *rampant* in Diamond/Pred. Literally my first game in Diamond, my buddy and I are playing with a random third. We fight one squad, knock 2, third one poofs into a box while running away. Later my buddy goes down, random goes down, as I try to make some kind of play the random DC'd. Played two more games, same shit. I honestly haven't touched ranked since because 1) I'm probably not getting further than Diamond IV this season and 2) the dashboarding is making it ridiculous. I can't wait for this to be fixed.",

Skeet doesn't try to intimidate the customers by being pretentious unlike Jimmy. Jimmy calls salt sodium chloride in public! Like yeah, salt is sodium chloride but, but you don't fucking call salt sodium chloride in fucking public Jimmy what the fuck? that's fucking autistic you autistic bitch cunt, god I hate Jimmy, Jimmy kept being a cunt by not listening to Skeet. Jimmy did not use the cash register because he thinks he is smarter than the fucking cash register. Jimmy is actually a fucking dumbass because the cash register is used for inventory tracking. Skeet had every right to fucking fire this pretentious asshole Jimmy, but Skeet kept giving Jimmy more chances because Skeet is a man of morals. Skeet knows Jimmy, Skeet knows Jimmy, Skeet knows the chaotic shit that Jimmy has cursed on Retroville. Because Skeet has a set of morals and he is a kind humble man Skeet sees this as an opprotunity to change Jimmy's life so Jimmy can be a productive citizen of Retroville. Skeet wants Jimmy to succeed. And how does Jimmy repay Skeet? Jimmy illegally break into McSpanky's at night to change McSpanky's a once proud fast food chain into some souless artifical robotic nightmare he puts rockets in the fucking resturant, what the fuck Jimbo? Jimmy's robotic ways corrupts the resturant and the resturant just fucking flys and destroys the resturants with people in it! Seriously, the corrupt McSpanky's resturant just fucking annihilates these resturants not everybody could have made it out in time. Someone could have been taking a shit in there and fucking died, could you imagine that? Using the restroom in a resturant minding your own business but you fucking died because some stupid kid couldn't use the fucking cash register? McSpanky's get destroyed and a dream gets destroyed. Years of joy within that resturant just all fucking gone Skeet's entire life was dedicated to McSpanky's that was his purpose. Noboy knows where Skeet went after that incident, the dream is dead.

This is because they easily nucleate on dust particles, clump together and form inclusions.\n\nDespite this, I've kept trying to grow them over the past 3 years, and I've developed a somewhat reliable procedure to get transparent \\~1cm crystals. The last time I posted them on this sub, some of you wanted to know the procedure.\n\nTherefore, I have decided to write a detailed guide so that everyone can give it a try. There are pictures for every step and things to watch out for.\n\nYou can find it [here](https://crystalverse.com/sodium-chloride-crystals/).\n\nI think salt cubes are really cool - and the fact that they crystallize from such a common chemical makes it seem even more beautiful.\n\nFeel free to ask me if you've any questions, and have fun!",

    "body": "\\[A/N: First thing of mine on this subreddit that isn't a bastardization of some other, better author's work.\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tellamani people were not alone in the universe.\n\nAt first, it was just a whisper of radio signals, too regular to ignore but too brief to really place credence in.\n\nThen came another, then another, then a constant stream.\n\nOnce the scientists realized it was more than a fluke, it took all of two seconds to point a hypercom generator at the planet of origin and send a signal.\n\nAs ecstatic as the Tellamani had been to receive even the distant hints at intelligent life off of their own small blue moon, they were even more so to receive a return hypercom signal.\n\nAt first, it was nothing but unintelligible hash, the signal formats too different to read. There was intelligence behind the signal, but no sure meaning.\n\nSo they started from the ground up, with a short burst of mathematical sequences. They got the completed set, with another from the other people for them to complete. Within a single day, it was solved and sent, winging across the void with another set of Tellamani design, more complex than the last.\n\nFor dozens of revolutions, the scientists of two worlds labored so that they may one day talk in more than simple numbers and notation.\n\nThey failed. Every attempt to bridge the gap in cognition between the two people was foiled by some twist. Images were too complex, the computers unable to comprehend the radically different architecture of the others.\n\nWords were utterly unintelligible. Letters are images, after all. Pictograms couldn’t be deciphered, and even if they could, there would be no guarantee of a common frame of reference. The common interactions of the universe, gravity, electromagnetism, radioactivity, could be used, perhaps as metaphors, but there was no sure way to know if the others had interpreted it properly.\n\nBut as always, both peoples had numbers, math, and the concept of space. Everything needed to mark a place and a time. It took a few revolutions, but eventually the Tellamani managed to impress upon the others a desire to send a meeting in a certain place at a certain time. Or at least they thought they did. They could not be sure.\n\nThey would send a ship anyways. If the messages had not been interpreted, that would be fine. There would be no loss and both peoples would simply resume their attempts to translate each other’s messages.\n\nIf the others did send a representative, though, the reward would be immeasurable. A whole new civilization, with new science, new perspectives, and maybe, as some dared to hope, other contacts among the stars.\n\n\\-----\n\n“Realspace transition in 3… 2… 1…”\n\nThe bridge “windows” clear into a bright starscape as the diplomatic cruiser *Psilar* slides into position with barely a whisper of wasted radiation.\n\n“Status report!” Captain Clarix calls over the whine of deploying radiators as the *Psilar* began dumping the waste heat it had accumulated over the long slipspace journey.\n\n“All departments report nominal functioning of ship systems. Engineering clears for maneuvering,” calls out Nekamreh, the internal officer.\n\n“Slipspace eddies indicate that we have arrive 84 ticks ahead of indicated time,” reports the navigation officer.\n\n“Hold position! Internal, ensure that the diplomatic team is ready for contact.”\n\nClarix’s wings shuffle and his chest feathers flush a happy orange as he briefly contemplates being the officer presiding over the first meeting between two completely separate intelligent species.\n\n“Diplomatic team reports full readiness. All members–” The science external officer cuts off the internal officer’s report.\n\n“Energy surge bearing 488 by 673! Gamma radiation!”\n\n“Raise shields! Any chance this can be an anomaly?” Clarix snaps as he snaps himself out of his fantasies of first contact. His ship was in danger. This was in no place for something like that.\n\n“Scans indicate no proximate anomalies!”\n\n“Shields raised!”\n\nClarix watches as a shimmering film of blue energy slides over the *Psilar*, sparking as it shunts aside the gamma energy, glowing brighter as the energy surges ever higher.\n\nRadiation alarms begin to wail as the energy worms its way through the shield, battering at the fragile hull of the *Psilar*.\n\n“Energy increase is plateauing! Shields are keeping radiation below lethal–”\n\n“Contact!” The external combat officer, this time. “Bearing 488 by 673. *Large* contact!”\n\nOne window snaps to display the ship that had just appeared in what was an incomprehensible maelstrom of energy.\n\nClarix can’t prevent a small gasp from escaping his beak.\n\nAn immense iron construct, vaguely seed-shaped, floats placidly inside a deadly vortex of radiation. Readouts and overlays blink into existence around it, giving it scale.\n\nIt’s the size of a small island. And nearly solid armor.\n\n*It’s a warship.*\n\n“Radiation decreasing. Returning to safe levels,” The external science officer calls out, but Clarix is barely listening.\n\n*Have we been so naïve? Were we so eager to converse with some other soul in the universe that we overlooked something? Did we offend them?*\n\n“Contact is not maneuvering. Radiation is decreasing to baseline, communication is now possible.”\n\n*We may have just doomed everyone. If this is how they build warships, we have no chance of standing against them.*\n\n“Captain? Captain!”\n\nThe internal officer shakes him out of his reverie.\n\n“Yes, officer?”\n\n“Diplomatic team is reporting readiness. They are… eager, sir.”\n\n*Did none of them see it?*\n\n“Contact is sending a signal!”\n\n*This is it. The final threats*.\n\nOnly, it wasn’t. It was nothing more than an enthalpy equation describing the formation of sodium chloride. An incomplete one.\n\n*Do they want a response? Why the song and dance of sending a warship, but not attacking us immediately?*\n\n“Captain? Do you want to send a response?”\n\n*What it it’s not a warship? They came in a massive flash of radiation. That level of armor would certainly be necessary to withstand that.*\n\n“Captain!”\n\n*No. Yes.*\n\nClarix contemplates the decision for only a moment longer. They were not making any hostile moves, and nothing existed to be gained by fleeing.\n\n“Send the complete signal. Contact the diplomatic team. Initiate contact.”\n\n*If I’m wrong, their blood will be on my hands.*\n\n\\-----\n\nAmbassador Kaquila floats in freefall, halfway between the vast iron construct of the other people and his own comparatively tiny ship, trying to keep his thrilling heart in check.\n\nThe being before him is strikingly similar to his own. One head, albeit a round one. The helmet of the figure made no allowances for a beak. Two arms, ending in five blunt fingers instead of his four clawed ones. Two legs, with similarly structured boots. No wings at all.\n\nIt’s dressed in a white, reflective suit, with some sort of sleek pack on its back, which occasionally emits a white burst of gas to keep it centered, much the same as his own EVA pack.\n\nHesitantly, or so it seems, it raises one of its arms, extending all five of its fingers. The pack on its back pulses in a complicated sequence to compensate for the motion.\n\nHesitantly, Kaquila raises his own, reaching out and not quite touching.\n\nWhatever being was in the other suit seem to come to a decision, reaching out further, but it still seems hesitant as its hand hovers over his.\n\nKaquila is acutely aware of every single camera of the *Psilar* pointing at him, acutely aware of the eyes of the Tellamani people counting on him not to screw up.\n\nThey don’t stop him as he finally takes that last step, wrapping his own fingers around those of the other person.\n\nFirst contact. For real, this time.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n[Continuation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yq01cg/wp_when_humanity_developed_ftl_the_specifics_of/)",

Nothing could have prepared them for that encounter though.  \n  \n=== 7 hours earlier ===  \n  \nA brick block shaped Grargian ship exited FTL travel relatively smoothly, the field dampners not used to such long hauls producing vibrations and frying some power conduits.  \nSeveral others, smaller and sleeker war escorts, arriving shortly after with similar reports, nothing unusual really.  \n  \nThey had arrived at a orange-yellow star orbited by a single large cobalt blue gas giant, a predetermined meeting point between the two species long before. They themselves had brought some millitary backups just in case as experience had taught that some of the more warmongering species liked picking a fight as a test of sorts and signs showed this species was likely to be such a case.  \nThe escorts would stay a ways back, on standby, rarely needed with the feeling of additional security always a welcome one. \n  \nMany hours had passed and we nearly expected nothing to come of the meeting for one of a plethora of possible reasons. They came though, they sure did.  \nAt first every sensor aboard went haywire, detecting large quantities of radiation forcing all ships to raise their shields. It only grew worse from that moment on, but before we could leave it was like a portal to the bowels of the underworld itself were opening, our viewscreens barely able to display the growing tear of chaotic pulsing radiation energy.  \nA ship came through, if it even could be called a ship.  \n  \nShield generators were screeching and waste heat was vented wherever it could when these things, gnarly and blocky yet rounded and sleek in their overall design bumbled it's way out of that tear into realspace.  \n  \nWe had expected something regular, ships about half our size and we had fairly sizeable ships at that with a respectable 4km diplomatic block and several 2.5km warships respectively. Yet this thing dwarfed us with impunity and was easily the size of a large city reaching as much as 20km in length. Drinks were spilled, clothes soiled and the computers were finding weapons all over.  \n  \nThen we were hailed, happily one of their scientific members had spoken to one of ours, glad they could finally see face to face. detecting ours they had asked if it was a problem that they too had brought an escort and nobody dared to defy them making the scientist happy. Moments later a second ship appeared, even larger but not by much.  \nThis one clearly built for war making other look like a harmless toy, as it arrived one of our ships suffered severe damage from the burst of radiation energy it was assaulted by.  \n  \nThese \"humans\" as they called themselves were quick to help and got our comrades back up quickly, all the while apologies flooding our comms and sending some resources.  \n  \nOfficial business after that was taken care off and they left much as they had come, gifts were in our holds but it all felt very meaningless as what were they to tell the federation when even their most basic diplomatic mediation vessel was a behemoth armoured to withstand flying into a star if they so pleased it seemed. And versus them? We got these fancy shields...  \n  \nAs if that were to stop a hypervelocity slug the size of a porter... No, Harg thought, we best either befriend or avoid them or make sure we can meet them next time we meet.  \n  \nHarg laughed and spat in defeat before walking out back into the command center to fly them back home as fast they could manage.",

Second, what chemical form(s) is each element found in? To be found in seawater in large quantities, an element needs to preferentially form stable, water-soluble species. \n\n[This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust) shows the raw abundances of elements. As you can see, sodium is one of the most common elements on Earth. All of the more common elements are components of water, also found dissolved in water or tend to form insoluble chemical species. Chlorine isn't quite as common, but is still present in large amounts. However, the elements more common than chlorine don't prefer to form water soluble species in the presence of water, oxygen and each other. Thus, we are left with large quantities of sodium and chloride.",

Sodium and Chloride are the most concentrated ions in the ocean with respect to river waters (due to their extremely high solubility and low particle reactivity in the ocean). If it were due to sodium and chloride having the largest sources, they would also have to be the most abundant ions in river water, which they are not. \n\nSulphate and phosphate are used rapidly in the ocean by organisms and incorporated into organic matter. Lithium and potassium are certainly more soluble, but they have faster sinks - they can be removed by the hydrothermal circulation of seawater through the hot ocean crust. \n\nThis idea as a whole, is known as the kinetic model for seawater and is how chemical oceanographers understand the composition of the ocean - [Broecker 1971](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003358947190041X )",

The sources for these elements to the ocean is from the weathering of rocks on land, like all other major constituents of seawater. \n\nThe difference between sodium and chloride is their sinks from seawater a pretty different than other elements. The largest sink (exist mechanism from seawater) for these elements is basically drying up of ocean basins at the end of the Wilson cycle (the life cycle of oceans). This, as you can probably imagine, takes hundreds of millions of years. They are not significantly used in biological functions like other major constituents in seawater. \n\nOther major constitutes of seawater like calcium, magnesium, sulphate, ect. can get incorporated in the shells of phytoplankton or in their cells. That means these elements when the plankton die, or are consumed by the higher food chain and nicely packaged into fecal pellets are heavy enough to sink out of seawater and into ocean sediments.

        "body": "This is a good question. I've read some of the top upvoted comments and while there are parts of them that are close to the truth, they are all missing some *key* factors that adequately explain why Na+ Cl- are the dominant *ions* in sea water.\n\nFirstly, the comment by u/shieldvexor is accurate in the discussion of abundances (the usual term is crustal abundance, not concentration 'on earth'). Crustal abundance is a term used to describe the availability of a particular metal or element in the crust, since the crust is really the source of *most* of the elements we find in nature. This isn't 100% true, but it's true accounting for geologic time.\n\nSecond, We **must** look at solubility product of some other common salts in order to assess or conclude why those salts/ions are not more common in sea water. Lets take the obvious example of calcium carbonate. CaCO3 would be a strong contender for dissolved concentrations in seawater, given the incredible store of *solid phase* CaCO3 (consider all the detritus of millions of years of shellfish, bones and coral in the ocean), if the solubility product of CaCO3 was significantly lower, there would be a lot more Ca+2 CO3-2 in sea water, which would (could) make these ions contenders for the top salts. Lets look at another example: Since iron and oxygen are some of the most common elements on earth, we might expect that iron would make up a significant portion of of the ion strength in sea water. The reason iron isn't one of the top ions is because any iron that does go into the ocean is immediately precipitated out as iron oxy-hydroxide (FeOOH). Furthermore, iron which might have travelled down streams and rivers to the ocean would almost always be removed by settling out of the water column before it reached the ocean. Because iron oxy-hydroxide has a very , very low solubility product, there would be almost zero opportunity for any iron to reach the ocean unless mobilized by turbulent water. Since turbulent water hardly ever reaches the ocean (turbulent water carries a lot of energy and will erode mountains much more quickly than slow moving water, it means that turbulent water will always rapidly erode the source of the turbulence thus creating (eventually) a shallower slower moving river on account of the built up sediment. This slow moving water is a perfect place for iron precipitates to settle out of the water column.\n\nThirdly, and arguably most importantly, we have to account for source term liberation and mobility. Because sodium and chloride, potassium and some other mobile ions *are* mobile, they are rapidly leached out of rock. Since rock is gradually 'weathered' by wind and water, the process of weathering releases (liberates) the most mobile elements first. Other elements that are bound by higher energy bonds such as silica, aluminium, are slower to be released. This means that those elements that are released more rapidly are more heavily partitioned into the liquid phase, while elements (even when they are more abundant (e.g. iron, silica) are partitioned more heavily into the solid phase. We can consider the previous two points in context of this point: If silica or iron was not bonded so strongly, what would happen? The liberation would elevate water in contact with source terms, but, since mobility isn't as high (also KSP's lower) then transport from the source term to the ocean would still take longer, and thus other elements with higher mobility would still out-compete these elements.\n\nIn summation, the reason why Na, Cl is elevated in comparison to all of the other potential salts is because of source term liberation mechanics favouring partitioning into the liquid phase, higher mobility (higher solubility product) in water, and finally elevated crustal abundance concentrations in the source term.\n\nThere are a few other more technical reasons regarding extremely high salinity water adversely affecting solubility constraints and the hydration spheres (positive/negative ion density of the ions and associated water molecule arrangements) but I'm not going to go into detail on these because they are largely irrelevant given the scale of the differences we are discussing - hyper salinity will adversely affect *all* salts with the possible exception of some Ca+2, Na+ and K+ salts as a function of Debye & Huckel's observations (and others) as early as 1920's.\n\nThere is good reading on this topic and many advancements in the last 40 years (since the early 1980's) with special note to Kenneth Pitzer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitzer_equations",

    "body": "M42, 5’11” (180cm), SW: 178.2lbs (81.1kg), EW: 163.2.6lbs (74.0kg)  \n  \n**TL;DR**: Not as transcendental of an experience as I thought it would be.  The lows of hunger were not bad.  The highs of first food after a week were not that high.  I lost a little weight. My sense hunger is a little better calibrated.  I survived.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n# Background  \nFirst extended water fast – 7 days (Sunday to Sunday).  Previously I had done hundreds of 24-hour dry fasts and one 48-hour dry fast.  \n   \n**WHY**: curiosity, test of will, to reign in my abysmal snacking habits, and I wanted to hit *CTRL+ALT+DEL* on my sense of hunger.  I expected to lose wieght, but gain most of it back, which was fine.  \n\n&nbsp;    \n# The Fast\n  \n**DIET, SUPPLEMENTS**: I drank about 3 liters (12 cups, 96oz, 0.75gal) of water a day.  In the morning I would take 3/4tsp (4g) of sodium chloride with water.  In the evenings I would take 1/4-1/2tsp (2-5g) of potassium chloride with water. I took a bath with 2 cups (500g) of epsom salt for magnesium (got tired of drinking salt water, so made the skin do the work). For sit down meals or social settings, I would drink a pellegrino mineral water.  I also chewed probably 60 peices of sugar-free gum...\n  \n**CIRCUIT BREAKERS**: I decided upfront I would stop the fast if I experienced:  \n\n* vomiting/nausea > 24hrs  \n* sustained lower blood pressure  \n* unusual heart rate patterns  \n* consistently low blood glucose  \n* diarrhea > 24hrs  \n  \n&nbsp;    \n# Results\n  \n**DATA:** I tracked 9 sets of data during the fast from hourly to daily.  Resulting charts can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/yN4QtU9).  Discussion of the data can be found on [this post in r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8ify4f/i_ate_nothing_for_a_week_drank_water_here_is_the/).\n  \n**HUNGER:** \"How hungry do you feel?\"  #1 question if someone discovered I was fasting.  I asked myself once an hour and recorded it.  I used a 4-point scale:  \n  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 - no hunger  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 - hunger that I could distract easily  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - hunger that was difficult to ignore  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 - really wondering if I am going to make it \n     \nPre fast, I averaged hunger of 0.2 over a day.  During the fast my hunger averaged 0.8.  Post fast, hunger has been 0.0.  Around 20% of fast was hunger that was tough to ignore.  Only twice did I get any real pangs (Days 3, 4).  For me Days 2, 3, 4 were all about the same average hunger.  \n  \n**WEIGHT:** Peak to trough, I lost 15lbs (6.8kg).  My guess is half of that was muscle/liver glycogen stores and associated water and the other half was split 50/50 between fat and muscle.  I gained 5lbs (2.2kg) within the first 24 hours of breaking the fast.  I suspect weight will bobble around 170lbs (77.1kg).  \n  \n**ACTIVITY:** Nothing changed for me.  I worked M-F 5am-4pm.  I ran/walked 16 miles for excercise during the week.  I cooked dinner for my family. I felt fainter Days 5, 6.  My heart rate would go higher than expected for a particular activity (i.e. vacuuming or painting).  But nothing was \"off limits\" becuase of the fast.  I did go on one hike with two friends on Day 5.  Very steep climbs.  Heart rate hit 180bpm.  I was exausted for several hours after that - even the rest of the fast.  \n  \n**BLOOD SUGAR:** My lowest reading was 65mg/dL.  As I got further into the fast, my blood sugar would increase after excercise.  My average was 78mg/dL throughout the fast and never became a concern.  \n  \n**KETOSIS:** I used urinalysis to test for the presence of acetoacetic acid, indicating ketosis.  First traces showed up 18 hours into the fast. By day two test strips were pink (moderate).  Day 3 and beyond were purple (high). Coming off the fast indcators fell sharply after my first meal, but low readings persisted for about 48 hours after the fast. \n  \n**OTHER VITALS:** Heart rate and blood pressure never manifested any persistent readings that were of concern.  \n  \n**STRESS:** My work is quantitative and results driven.  Each day I know how my results compare to the last twelve months and can tell if it was above or below average.  During my fast, I had 20th, 12th, 21st, 14th, and 71st percentile days (the week was a 12th percentile week).  They were the types of days that would normally drive me to a package of oreo cookies for self-medication.  The fast prevented some bad habits from surfacing, but I didn't feel like the days were more difficult becuase of the hunger.  I didn't notice any increased curtness or impatience.  \n  \n**COMPLICATIONS:** I came into the fast with two injuries.  A pulled hamstring and an injured back joint/disc, which I had been nursing with informal physical therapy excercises daily.  Both injuries persisted through the fast with no real change.  I had two notable complications during the fast: diarrhea and back pain.  \n  \n|#|descrpition|  \n|-----|-----|\n|COMP #1|Diarrhea presented on Day 6. Normal bowl movements had ceased since Day 3.  I had determiend to stop if diarrhea persisted for more than 24 hours, but since I only had 24 hours left, I just pressed on.  But I suspect the issue may have been related to Complication #2.|\n|COMP #2|Back pain was masked by the back injury I had coming into the fast.  Around Day 3 I noticed the pain as different from the injury.  Day 5 I was worried.  I have Gilbert’s syndrome, a recessive genetic mutation that results in my liver underprocessing biliruben. Usually it has no effect, but its symptoms (yellow skin and eyes) get worse during episodes of intense excercise, menstration, and NOT EATING! Day 4 my wife noticed my skin and scleras (whites of the eyes) were yellow. Day 5 they were worse.  Biliruben is elimnated via kidneys (after gut bacteria work on it) through urine and via liver (after gut bacteria work on it) through stool.  So now my concern is that my with nothing in my gut, billiruben is backing up in my blood and causing problems for my liver, hence the back pain.  I also suspect that may have been the cause of the diarrhea which was very liquid and very yellow. I debated stopping Day 5 and Day 6.  My eyes looked a little better on Day 7, after the diarrhea. It certainly gives me pause before considering a fast longer than a week. The back pain subsided by morning after I broke my fast.|  \n   \n&nbsp;    \n#Experience vs Expectations  \n   \nI read a few fast journals/videos, so I was curious to see how my experience compared to others'.  Here are a few observations:  \n  \n**Things I expected that did happen**  \n\n* **I was cold:** I wore a sweatshirt/sweater all day with colleagues in short sleeves.  \n* **Mouth tasted metallic/fruity:** that has even persisted some after breaking the fast.  \n   \n**Things I expected that didn't happen**   \n  \n* **Skin:** I didn't notice any clearer, more elastic, more youthful skin.  Just more yellow...  \n* **Sleep:** I was worried about hunger interrumpting my sleep.  I hit 7-8 hours.  No issues going to sleep.  No problems waking up (other than the usual). The only interuption was urinating during the night later in the fast, which is usually not an issue.  \n* **Emotional:** I didn't find myself more cranky or impatient.  \n* **Mental clarity/focus:** I kept hourly figures on this one along side my hunger statistic, but nothing came of it.  I didn't feel any enhanced ketone high.  I found work more productive becuase I was tyring hard to avoid thinking about how hungry I might feel.\n* **Tummy grumbles:** I expected a lot of grumbles.  I experienced significantly less than on my normal diet.  Almost non-existant.  \n* **Vision:** I didn't feel my vision improved any.  \n  \n**Things I didn't expect that did happen**  \n  \n* **Salts were huge:** I didn't think salts could have that much of an impact on me.  But after the illness of swiging brine wore off in a few seconds, I felt MUCH better after.  It made me realize how much of my past dry-fast discomfort was not food, but water and salts...\n* **Mucus/sneezing:** I didn't have any allergies or runny nose during the fast, but I sneezed more.  When I ate, drips and sinus inflamation came back.\n* **Muscle soreness:** I was surprised how little my legs hurt after runs and hikes.  I thought it was the epsom salt baths.  Within hours of eating, a week's worth of muscle soreness hit my legs - crying for attention.  \n* **Flatulence:** intestines clear out, stay empty, but then fill back up after breaking the fast.  They will push out any air left in there.  It was a lot.  \n  \n&nbsp;  \n##Breaking the fast  \nI ate 200 calories every 2 hours for the first 24 hours (the portion I was awake).  The meals I had were:  \n\n1. watermelon, bone broth  \n2. cucubmers, half a banana, bone broth  \n3. mashed potato, 1/2c kiefer yogurt  \n4. salad greens, potato leek soup, 1/2c kiefer yogurt  \n5. 2 eggs, tomatoes, onions, herbs, bone broth  \n6. bell bepper, Raw Juicery Mucho Matcha (cold pressed kale)  \n7. carrots  \n  \nI didn't have any negative reactions to reintroducing food.  Blood sugars were all over the map after these simple meals.  I expect BG will remain high until muscle and liver replenish sugar stores. My blood sugars were not that reactive before the fast, so that new behavior concerns me somewhat.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n##Benefits  \nI feel better after the fast.  Hard for me to say if I am better than a week ago or if my body is just telling me \"Thank you for feeding me, please don't starve me again.\"  \n  \nI expect to gain back most of the weight.  I haven’t changed my lifestyle other than this last week, but if some of the weight stays off, great…  \n  \nHunger and snacking is different post fast.  It's dangerous to forecast what will change based on a few days after the fast, but I feel like my sense of hunger has recalibrated.  I don't feel as snacky.  I don't finish a meal and have a hankering for something sweet to finish the meal.  I can eat a big meal and not feel an energy crash.  The reflex of dismissing the thought \"let's go see what is in the kitchen\" is still here from the fast so far.  If that all persists, it will be a pleasant take away - exactly what I was looking for. \n\n&nbsp; \n**EDIT** *2018.05.22*: [2-week follow-up can be found here on r/fasting](https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/8lbzfh/2week_followup_to_7day_water_fast_only_1_chart/) \n",

        "body": "I’m no doctor, but based on your data and information that you have given, I think your immune system slightly deteriorated while on the fast (emphasis on the “slightly”). Here’s my explanation: \n\n1) You had two minor injuries going into the fast. Your immune system was already working on those. Vitamins B, C, and iron help keep your immune system in shape, but according to your data you weren’t taking in those nutrients (I’m not sure what was in the mineral water, so I could already be wrong at this point). \n\n2) You said you had diarrhea. Drinking plenty of water is necessary, especially when fasting. Water always has stuff in it, few times it’s bad stuff, but mostly stuff that doesn’t really do anything. With a healthy, working immune system, your body should have no problems getting rid of those pathogens without you even noticing. While you were fasting, you were drinking more amounts of water, which gave you a higher chance of receiving a pathogen. With the slightly weaker immune system, you ended up with diarrhea.\n\n3) Your lack of sore muscles. When we exercise, our muscles rip on a microscopic scale. Sore muscles are due to your muscles healing from those tiny little rips. A weak immune system may attribute to a lack of soreness.\n\nAgain I’m no doctor so I could be completely wrong. I’m just using my limited knowledge of biology and wellness. I’d be interested if you did this experiment again, but without having any injuries, whether minor or major. Thanks for doing this experiment! I’ve always wanted to try fasting but my Hispanic family makes everyone eat like it’s their last meal, so it’s hard to make myself start. Hopefully you keep some of the benefits from fasting!",

She then realized that the room was apparently empty. Nadine was neither in her bed nor at the desk. Also, the wardrobe was open for some reason, even though there was nothing in it. After a few steps into the room, Githaiy finally spotted her. The small alien was... lying on the ground?\n\nNo, that was just how it looked at first. In reality, she was holding her body in a straight line, using one hand to repeatedly push herself upward while the other was resting on her back.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Training.\"\n\n\"Is that the \"light exercise\" you mentioned?\"\n\n\"No, this is heavier stuff,\" she said without pausing. She gave herself a stronger push so she was now at a 45° angle, switched the positions of her hands, and then continued the exercise with the other.\n\n\"I am used to a stronger gravity. If I don't do this, then my muscles will deteriorate. It's also a good distraction from... ah, not important.\"\n\nThat remark made the doctor clairaudient.\n\n\"Distraction from what?\"\n\n\"Nothing, it's fine.\"\n\n\"But why would-\"\n\n\"I SAID IT'S FINE!\"\n\nThe doctor took a step back, startled by the sudden outcry. Nadine's voice, even though it had been soft as always, had just gotten LOUD. Louder than any Vanaery could shout, and way louder than she had ever expected this meek voice to ever become.\n\nThe room fell quiet. Only a moment later, Nadine's eyes sprung wide open in realization and she scrambled to her feet.\n\n\"Ah, I-I'm sorry, I didn't want... I-I didn't mean to... I just didn't sleep well and... n-no, that's not an excuse, I'm so sorry, I...\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Githaiy reassured her as soon as she pulled herself together. \"No harm was done. Let's just get to the taste-testing. I also brought some of the guthra fruits you seemed to like yesterday, just in case none of the other stuff makes a proper firstmeal.\"\n\nThe corners of her mouth moved slightly upwards. Apparently, this so-called \"smile\" was a gesture that could mean a load of things depending on the context, but it usually stood for either friendliness or joy. It was one of many, MANY expressions the alien girl's face was capable of. Sure, there were endoskeletal races in the alliance, but none of them were able to move their faces that much.\n\n*Just how many muscles does her face have? Not to mention those color changes...*\n\n\"You know,\" Nadine's soft voice pulled her out of her thoughts, \"it is kinda interesting that the translator calls it \"firstmeal\", even though it is not exactly what my people would call firstmeal.\"\n\nThe doctor cocked her head.\n\n\"What else would that refer to? Firstmeal simply is the first meal of the day, I mean, it is literally those two words together.\"\n\nOne of Nadine's eyes seemed to close slightly, while the other opened further, before both opened all the way.\n\n\"Oh, so that's what you hear when is say...\" she took off her translator and said a word Githaiy couldn't pronounce.\n\n\"The word in my language doesn't actually mean \"first meal\". Anyway, what I was getting at, my people usually eat firstmeal right after getting up, not multiple hours - sorry, invas into the day.\"\n\n\"Really? Isn't that a very long pause until lastmeal?\"\n\n\"We eat three meals per day, so no.\"\n\n\"If you need food more frequently, you can just say so.\"\n\n\"Nah, don't sweat it.\"\n\n*Don't... what is \"sweat\" supposed to mean?*\n\n\"It's not that I NEED it in that frequency, we just do it that way because it fits our daily routine. There are also people who skip firstmeal. Also, that meat stuffs quite a bit. Anyway, did you get some of those tikros? ...tikro? Tikri?\"\n\n\"The plural is also just tikro. Though I have no idea why you are so excited about those.\"\n\n\"Well, it's cattle feed, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, especially onrics love it. Why?\"\n\n\"Well, that means it's probably highly nutritious. Sure, they might need other things, but worth a try.\"\n\nGithaiy pointed to one of the platters and took the lid off.\n\n\"The ones on the right are raw, the left boiled, just as you wanted. But be careful, the raw ones are quite-\"\n\nWith a loud crunching sound, half of the tuber disappeared in the small alien's mouth.\n\n\"...hard. How strong is your jaw?\"\n\n\"Not shure, I shink it wash around 80 kilogramsh, sho... ah, right, we forgot to weigh me, dunno how mutsh that ish. But it'sh at leasht 700 veysh.\"\n\nBefore Githaiy could comment on that, Nadine held her hand in front of her mouth and spit the piece she bit off back on the plate.\n\n\"Tastes like dry flour, bah!\"\n\nShe then took a boiled one. It had soaked quite a bit of water and was now bigger and a bit squishy. Taking a bite caused some of the water to get squeezed out, but it didn't stay in Nadine's mouth for long.\n\n\"Ugh, how the hell can something be that moist, yet STILL taste like dry flour?\"\n\nThe rest of the taste-testing didn't go too bad, Nadine could eat around one-quarter of the things prepared this time. However, Githaiy had one more thing for her.\n\n\"This powder contains sodium chloride, potassium, and the like. If you mix a bit with our normal tap water you should be able to cover some of your necessities.\"\n\n\"Wow! Thanks, Doc, that's-\"\n\n\"But remember: this stuff is toxic to us, so be careful!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I'll-\"\n\nA knock on the door interrupted them.\n\n\"I have a package for Lady Nadine,\" one of the maids said upon entering. \"Together with a message: \"I tried to finish the first set as quickly as possible, the rest will take a bit longer\".\"\n\nWith a bow, she placed the small box on the desk and left. It only took Nadine a few moments to practically rip it open. The first thing she took out was a strange, small wooden plate with leather straps on it.\n\n\"Would you look at that, those are actually proper sandals. And the rest... what fabric is that, it feels amazing!\"\n\n\"Probably goan-silk, one of the highest quality materials you can find on Hohmiy.\"\n\n\"Okay, the baby blue thing is the top, and the mint green looks like a skirt. Let's see!\"\n\nNadine jumped off her chair, threw away her blanket, and put on her new clothes. The \"baby blue\" top covered her upper torso in a slightly triangular shape while leaving the shoulders free. The \"mint green\" skirt was fairly long as it almost reached her knees, and was held in place by a thin belt with three blue gems in the buckle. The \"sandals\" were apparently a kind of shoe.\n\nWhen she finished dressing, Nadine's pale face became a bit more reddish.\n\n\"Wow,\" Githaiy marveled. \"You really look like a proper noble lady now.\" Was that how parents felt when they saw their kid in clothes for the first time? Maybe finding out Nadines relative age had awoken some motherly instincts in her. After all, at sixteen cycles, she was already fairly old for an unmarried woman.\n\n\"You... sure?\" Nadine asked, not sounding very convinced.\n\n\"Do you not like it?\"\n\n\"N-no, it looks great, it just a bit... skimpy. I mean, it fits the warm climate, but it's more something a human would wear to a beach party than a noble's estate. Also, I'm not really used to having my midriff exposed.\"\n\n\"Really? To me, you look ready to be greeted by the king himself!\"\n\nNadines face became even redder.\n\n\"W-well, when in Rome... I'm sure I'll get used to it. Definitely better than running around in bedsheets.\"\n\nGithaiy took a deep breath. There was no point in postponing it, she needed to talk about the things Kiyrtin had discovered, even if it was just to confirm they were normal for her kind.\n\n\"By the way, I never asked you about your sleeping habits.\"\n\n\"Sleeping habits?\"\n\n\"Yes, just to confirm your needs are covered. Krsnelv for example need fairly large beds because they move a lot during their sleep.\" That was a lie, no species she knew moved in their sleep. \"Do humans move as well?\"\n\n\"Not really. Some do it a bit when they dream or have a nightmare.\"\n\nThe doctor cocked her head.\n\n\"Dream? What's that?\"\n\n\"Wait, seriously? You guys don't dream? It's uh... how do I explain that... when we sleep, our brain processes the information it gathered. During that time we see things, sometimes lucid, sometimes weird, sometimes complete bullshit.\"\n\n\"So a hallucination?\"\n\n\"Not... really? Or is it? Now that you ask, I wonder if that is similar.\"\n\n\"And that happens every night?\"\n\n\"Yes, although most of the time you forget it the moment you wake up.\"\n\nGithaiy nodded in fascination. Was her thrashing around because of a dream?\n\n\"And the other thing you mentioned, um...\"\n\n\"Nightmare? That is a... bad dream. Imagine... imagine your worst fears coming true, and you are right in the middle of it. Your heart is pounding so loud that it feels like you're alarming the whole world of your presence. You try to hide, but you always get found immediately. You try to fight, but your arms are so weak you almost can't lift them. You try to flee, but your legs are so heavy that you barely move forward. You scream for help, but all you can muster is a faint whisper. And when it seems as if everything is too late, you wake up, but you are not fully awake yet and can still see the horrors in the darkness of your room, you don't know what is real and what isn't. Slowly, everything calms down and the dream starts to slip your mind. You can't remember what exactly you have seen, all you remember is the fear and despair you felt. You are exhausted, you want to sleep, but you dread what you'll see when you close your eyes again. You...\"\n\nWith her head jolting up, Nadine snapped out of the trance she had seemingly talked herself into.\n\n\"S-sorry, I didn't mean to... I... I'll take a walk, I need air.\"\n\nWith that, the small alien left the room. Githaiy said nothing. Even if she had wanted to say something, she wouldn't have been able to. She just sat there, not moving a single muscle. She was a doctor. Throughout her career, she had seen a lot of gruesome and horrible things. Never in her life could she have imagined that one day, mere words would make her freeze in fear.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rmacpo/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_1/)\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/tz87eh/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_15/)\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/uastap/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_17/)",

We dream during deep sleep and REM phase.   \nAlso our brains often shut down our motor functions during sleep in order not to injure ourselves during sleep trashing when we fight our nightmares. Makes a preety frightening experiance when you wake up and can't move, especially when you experiance it for the first time.   \nAnd boy is the doctor gonna be suprised, when she learns of sleep walking. \n\nActually Nadine is going in the right direction with her excercisses. Not only is she keeping herself in shape but helps with stress relief as well. \n\nOne study profiled college students during their examination periods and found that exercise and physical activity can reduce test-related stress. Regullar excercisses also help with disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. \n\nWhile it would be a slow process, training yourself to the point, where you simply collapse on bed, is quite likely to lessen the nightmares she is experiencing. There is still gonna be some trauma at the back of her head, deep in her mind, but it should be manageble and could lessen in time, especially if she is in a safe envirnoment. \n\nAlso could make for a fun chapter where she pushes her physsical limits and the royal guards/soldiers try to keep up :) \n\nDisclaimer: I am not a medical professional, just an enthusiast. :)",

They might try either drying them to see if they make a flour, or cutting and soaking them, then drying the fluid.\n\nEDIT: Not that I've ever eaten whole boiled cattail roots, that's just what I thought of when I read the chapter. \n\nOf course, things will still be difficult if they don't have gluten- the bread will have a hard time staying together, even if its a flatbread- and heaven forbid Nadine try to make a leavened dough.\n\n>I mean, it fits the warm climate, but it's more something a human would wear to a beach party than a noble's estate.

Considering the modern ubiquity of short shorts and tank-tops in warmer parts of the US, I wonder if the pendulum swung closer to the Victorians in the intervening centuries.\n\n>Krsnelv for example need fairly large beds because they move a lot during their sleep  \n>  \n>\"Dream? What's that?\"\n\nSo they dream but don't remember it? How odd.\n\nIf the conversation ever turns to AI, this could be an interesting point- modern AI research has verified (experimentally, at least in some parts, not merely as theory) that one of the functions of dreaming is to avoid overfitting to data, as well as to practice data learned during the day by inventing new scenarios, and to avoid cascading failures of the neural network. If their researchers realize this, they could ask Nadine about it in order to improve their own AI.\n\n(No, seriously- scientists created a neural network that had similar waveforms and growth patterns to animal brains. Creating sleep-like patterns and self-learning was required to stabilize the network.)",

All that's left is somehow getting Kiyrtin under control.\"\n\n\"Your Highness, if I may\", the steward asked, \"when are you planning to inform your parents regarding your... guest?\"\n\n\"Whenever I deem it the right time to do so.\"\n\nThe steward, getting the hint that the conversation was over, took a bow and left the room, seamlessly trading places with Doctor Githaiy, who was now entering.\n\n\"Stressful day?\"\n\nSilgvani sighed.\n\n\"Well, the Tystrie ambassador is coming in a few days, I need to prepare everything for our new trade route with the Krsnelv, and then there is also the aftermath of the Kiroscha attack. By the First Ones, the only thing missing would be my melt-molting beginning early. But those aren't your troubles. How did your talk with Nadine go? Could you figure something out?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite a few things, actually. Something you should know first: as it turns out, Nadine is a noble.\"\n\nSilgvani paused. That was indeed pivotal. Sure, it didn't change anything in the short term. Nadine was already treated as a royal guest anyway, and since she hadn't said anything so far, she didn't seem to put much emphasis on her rank. However, it would be vital information should she interact with anyone outside of the star palace, not to mention when they would make contact with her people. However, something was bugging her.\n\n\"When I first talked to her, she was extremely nervous and had no idea how to address me. Even if their etiquette is different from ours, she should've still gotten educated in it. Or is she maybe a first-generation noble like you? But even then, she would've met their king when she got the title. Or is their culture THAT different from ours?\"\n\nThe doctor chuckled.\n\n\"It is, yes, but not the way you think. But to answer your other question first, no, she is not a first-generation. On the contrary, she can trace her lineage back almost seven hundred years, which is equal to over a thousand of our solar cycles.\n\nNow Silgvani was dumbfounded. Even the founder of her clan, Kiyron, had \"only\" risen to power around six hundred cycles ago, two hundred cycles before the unification war. And Nadine's family was almost twice as old?\n\n\"So Nadine is not only not a commoner, she is the descendant of the currently oldest noble family in the alliance? Yet she never said anything? Well then, please do tell me how their culture is different in \"not the way I think\", doctor.\"\n\n\"It is... a bit complicated. I think it's best to give you my full report.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm sorry for the inconvenience Doc,\" Nadine apologized as the two of them entered her room. Her face's color was fairly pale compared to before, and dark shades had appeared under her eyes. The small alien had explained that she didn't really know *how* this came to be, but had insisted that this was just a sign of her being tired and nothing noteworthy.\n\n\"Don't worry. The palace is big, getting lost is something that can happen if you're not accustomed to it. Although you could've just asked one of the servants to bring you to my office.\"\n\n\"I-I thought they were busy and didn't want to disturb them.\"\n\n\"You are right, they are busy. Busy serving the people in this palace. Which includes you. But I just wanted to ask you some more questions, so whether we do it here or in my office doesn't really matter.\"\n\nShe held up a small device.\n\n\"And should an emergency arise, all one needs to do is press the button next to my door and I'll get notified.\"\n\nAs they walked over to the chairs, Githaiy sneaked a glance at the desk. There was a small pile of sheets, the top one filled with a script the doctor had never seen. That had to be Nadine's native language. She also noticed that some words were crossed out.\n\n*Ah, yes, the pain of physical writing.*\n\nGithaiy couldn't even remember when she had written in physical the last time. Then again, their datapads couldn't reproduce the foreign script, and not being able to delete mistakes was a smaller annoyance compared to handwriting on a screen. Still, there were A LOT of words crossed out. Probably had been a while for Nadine as well. There were also some spots where the writing appeared to be slightly washed out as if someone had dribbled water onto the sheet. Had she spilled her drink?\n\nNext to the sheets, there was a box of molting tissues. Or, to be exact, a box that had at one point contained molting tissues. Its former contents could now all be found in the trashbin below the desk.\n\nNadine pulled her chair away from the desk, turned it around, and climbed onto it. It once again showed how tiny she was. She had even put a pile of pillows on the seat so she could reach the desk.\n\n\"I heard the dressmaker will need a few days, will you be fine till then?\"\n\n\"It's quite warm, so yeah, I'll manage. Though I'm curious how the sandals will turn out, he got really eager when I described those to him. But anyway, you wanted to talk about the food issue?\"\n\n\"Correct. We still have some leftover meat from the Kiroscha storage, but that won't last long. I also can't imagine that it gives you everything you need.\"\n\nThe alien girl nodded.\n\n\"The problem is that your list can only do so much as my knowledge is only rudimentary. The best course of action would probably be to rule out the things that are poisonous to me and then just experiment. I'm not a nutritionist after all.\"\n\n*She isn't? Then how come she knows so much about it? Well, I can ask that later, there are more pressing things I have to figure out first.*\n\n\"A different question. Just to make sure, you... wouldn't happen to be a noble, would you?\"\n\n\"I... well... I mean... if the options are just yes and no, then yes, I am a noble.\"\n\n*Oh, thank the First Ones I asked!*\n\n\"... technically.\"\n\nGithaiy stopped taking notes and looked up.\n\n\"What do you mean, technically?\"\n\n\"Well... it's true that my mother's family holds a title, but...\"\n\n\"Did she lose it? Because she married a commoner?\"\n\n\"What? No! I meant... you know what, let's go back to start. Yes, I am a noble. No, that fact does not carry any weight. I have the same last name then some dude from the early 16th century, but that's it. The title doesn't mean anything.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Doesn't mean anything??\"\n\nThe doctor nodded.\n\n\"According to her, being a noble only means, and I quote: \"that I can write a fancy word in front of my last name\". They once had nobility similar to ours, but nowadays, it is mostly viewed as an archaic concept. Most countries of her homeworld have either abolished their ruling class or transformed it into something called \"constitutional monarchy\", which I have to admit, I didn't fully understand. It is still an important takeaway, just a different one than we expected: should we ever make contact with the Humans, treating some differently based on their heritage is what would offend them, not the other way round.\"\n\n\"I'll make sure that get that noted. What about... you know, the other thing?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Regarding those,\" Githaiy said, pointing at the empty tissue box. \"You seem to have used up quite a lot. Is everything alright?\"\n\n\"I... yes, you don't need to worry about it.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I apologize if I sound pushy, but I am aware that there are things one doesn't like to talk about. Please do remember that I am your doctor though.\"\n\nNadine was quiet for a while before she took a deep breath.\n\n\"I am aware. But I assure you, there is nothing wrong with me physically, and I am in no need of medical attention.\"\n\n\"... very well. Different question, would you mind if I took the bin with me?\"\n\nThe small alien cocked her head.\n\n\"Why would you want some used tissues?\"\n\n\"To run some chemical analysis. One never knows where important information hides.\"\n\n\"Um, okay, suit yourself then.\"\n\n\"Thank you. By the way...\"\n\nShe didn't finish her sentence, as her emergency alarm called her back to her office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"... that concludes my report.\"\n\n\"I see. But what did you hope to get from the analysis?\"\n\n\"A lot, actually. Most of it was already dried, but it appears as though she used the tissues for two different things. One was a rather clear liquid that, interestingly, contained sodium chloride and hyaluronic acid among other things. The other was some yellowy mucus made out of some proteins as well as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium.\"\n\n\"It's not blood, is it?\"\n\n\"No, her blood is red. But whatever this mucus is, she probably needs everything in it. It is... interesting to call that a nutrient list, but we should be able to procure all of that.\"\n\n\"That is good news. What about the emergency?\"\n\n\"What emergency?\"\n\n\"Well, the one that sounded your alarm.\"\n\n\"Oh, that. No one was there when I returned and none of the servants knew anything, so I assume Prince Kiyrtin was just pressing the button for fun.\"\n\nSilgvani didn't answer. She simply groaned and buried her face in her hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rmacpo/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_1/)\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/tpr049/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_12/)\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/tw2g4b/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_14/)",

    "body": "So before I start please take everything I am about to say with a large dose of sodium chloride. What I am about to tell you is all theory and speculation about what we might encounter in The Witch-Queen.\n\nNow we all know that Savathûn is indeed [The Witch-Queen](https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2020/06/09/destiny-2-witch-queen-lightfall-news_feature.jpg) known for her cunning and intelligence. But hearing \"Witch-Queen\" so often had me eventually start asking... \n\n*Which Queen?*\n\nNow for the record I don't necessarily think this play on words was intended, but nevertheless its got me thinking. Which Queen will we fight in the The Witch-Queen?\n\nAs it stands there is not one, not two but **three queens** (four if you count the Darkness as The Queen of Final Shapes but I don't think She counts for reasons I will explain).\n\n**Mara Sov**, **Queen of the Awoken** \n\n**Savathûn, the Witch Queen** \n\nand her sister **Xivu Arath, God of War** \n\nThree powerful women vying for the right to rule. For the right to be queen. (This is why I did not include the Darkness as the Darkness is interested in the final shape, not in being the final shape)\n\nI couldn't help be reminded of Toland's parable of Three Queens in the [Ghost Fragment: Darkness 3](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-darkness-3?highlight=three+queens) lore book.\n\n>*Imagine three great nations under three great queens. The first queen writes a great book of law and her rule is just. The second queen builds a high tower and her people climb it to see the stars. The third queen raises an army and conquers everything.*  \n>  \n>*The future belongs to one of these queens. Her rule is harshest and her people are unhappy. But she rules.*   \n>  \n>*And as the universe ticks on towards the close, the great players will face each other. In the next round there will be three queens and all of them will have armies, and now it will be a battle of swords - until one discovers the cannon, or the plague, or the killing word.* \n\nNow we could try to make one-to-one connections between the Queens. We know Mara built a great tower in the Dreaming City. Savathûn has wrote books and laws on Hive Arcana and recently the law of Imbaru. Xivu Arath is literally corrupting an army to her will.\n\nTo do so would be missing the point though, the reality is all three of the queens have armies, laws and towers. The illustration he is making is that nature obeys the law of the jungle, survival of the fittest. Sword logic. The winner gets to decide the shape the future will take. \n\n What is interesting however is what Toland mentions in the last two paragraphs.\n\n>*Of course, it* ***might be that there was another country, with other queens, and in this country they sat down together and made one law and one tower and one army to guard their borders****. This is the dream of small minds: a gentle place ringed in spears.*  \n>  \n>*But* ***I do not think those spears will hold against the queen of the country of armies****. And that is all that will matter in the end.* \n\nToland believes the Queen of Armies will win. Toland if you don't know is a follower of the sword logic and derogatorily calls us Opener of Vacancies for not taking our rightful mantle as Taken Kings when we defeated Oryx. If Toland was a betting man I can guarantee you which queen he would be placing his money on. \n\nXivu Arath.\n\nAs far as Toland is concerned, all of Mara's secrets and Savathûn's cunning will not save them from the Hive God of War who's entire goal it seems is raising an army to achieve just that purpose. But this right here is in fact a perfect opportunity to settle the wager that the Gardner and the Winnower originally made.\n\nThere is one thing Toland isn't banking on, and that is Savathûn and Mara Sov forming an alliance the defeat the queen of armies herself, Xivu Arath.\n\nNow if you had asked me this a few weeks ago I would have told you you were crazy. But that was until we got the [Hawkmoon lore](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/hawkmoon?highlight=hawkmoon).\n\n>*What is this feeling?*  \n>  \n>*I did not ask for it. I do not understand it. I do not want it.*   \n>  \n>*They are celebrating their victory over the Taken. The Crow is making a gun shape with his hand, swinging the nearly empty bottle of wine around in the other like a Sword. The Guardian looks pensive, sitting on a rock by the fire, contemplating the secret they are keeping. The Crow notices, but tries not to show it. He wants the Guardian's spirits to be lifted. He wants to be supportive, so that they may share in their triumphs together.*  \n>  \n>*As equals.*   \n>  \n>*There is a growing kinship here. Against better judgment.*  \n>  \n>*What is this feeling?*\n\nNow when I first read this on the forums there was growing consensus that Savathûn had in fact grown a heart. I of course was far more suspicious and thought this was simply a master play on her part. But over time I began to realize that two things can be true at the same time.\n\nI believe for probably the first time in Savathûn's life she is beginning to realize the merit in cooperation and kinship. Savathûn as we know from her conversations with Nokris has already begun to doubt the sword logic. She has seen first hand it's failure in her brother Oryx. Savathûn of course is not her Brother. She is a master at cunning. It is her nature. And her very power - even life - depends on her acting according to her cunning nature lest her worm devour her.\n\nWhat would be more cunning than Savathûn aligning her interests with ours in order to defeat Xivu Arath?\n\nWe also have to consider that the mystique around Savathûn has been building for three years now. For her to simply be a boss we defeat in our final mission or even a raid would be a complete disservice to who she is and what she intends. Xivu Arath on the other hand has really only just been introduced to us, and the army she is corrupting right now is Chekhov's gun hanging on the wall.\n\nI do not necessarily think that Savathûn will become our friends, but I do believe she will form an alliance of sorts with us and Mara Sov and that Xivu Arath will instead be the main antagonist we defeat in the Witch Queen. I think Savathûn will continue to play a role over the next year culminating in Lightfall. And given the likelihood that we may end up gaining the corrupting powers of the Hive as a new subclass - who better to teach us?\n\nWhether my prediction comes true or not only time will tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR : I believe Savathûn will not be the main antagonist in Witch-Queen but rather Xivu Arath will be. Savathûn will instead use her cunning to form an alliance (real or temporary) with Mara Sov and us in order to defeat Xivu Arath. I believe it is through this alliance that we may ends up learning new darkness powers and potentially freeing the Dreaming City from it's curse.*\n\n\n\n\n*Edit: I realise the huge gambit I am taking with this post. As Savathun said: “I shall gather tribute from every false prediction, misguided theory, fearful rumor, and ominous supposition which derives from the thought of me. And in time, I shall pin my quiddity upon these rumors. I shall discorporate, so that I exist wherever my schemes and conspiracies also exist. And so I will be immortal, as long as anyone seeks to understand me and fails.“*\n\n\n\n*Edit 2: these comments are what I love most about this reddit sub. Such delicious spinfoil and wild conspiracy theory garnished with a hint of hysteria. Savathûn and her coven thank you Guardians for this banquet.",

Humanity has no connection in sword logic. Xivu-arath has been feeding her worm constantly since the taken king and which may have made her as powerful or almost as powerful as oryx(or to some people, Auryx). This means that since she is this she could very well be the raid boss or story antagonist.  However,  savathun is the aspect of trickery which means she is almost just as likely to be the story antagonist.",

Massive cannons on its back, missile launchers that looked more like air defense batteries, battle-screen projectors capable of putting out the equivalent of a Space Force Heavy Frigate's screens.\n\nIt wasn't the only one. There were hundreds, possibly thousands of them on the grassy plain. Most were still, others were moving with deliberate slowness, exaggerated movements that telegraphed what they were going to do.\n\nThe leader was knelt down, one fist grounded into the earth, the knuckles dug deep into the soft ground. Birds kept taking off from trees and landing on the massive cyborg before taking off again when it spoke.\n\n\"We shall protect these ones as you have requested. The Warsteel Cossacks of Siberia know what it is to be forced from our land,\" the massive cyborg rumbled. \"We of the Tuvan Warsteel Horde will ensure no harm comes to them and shall protect them from any who seek to harm them.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Warlord Chugunkin,\" the Tnvaru matron said. She barely came up to the top of his foot, but she held her warsteel gripping stick tightly and stared with eyes clear of fear into the glowing cyberoptics of the massive cyborg.\n\n\"Are all of your people so brave as to enter the Tuvan Ranges, Tnvaru Matron Sangbre?\" the cyborg asked.\n\nSangbre shook her head. \"Like all peoples, my people have those who are brave and those who are not,\" she said.\n\n\"Much like those you have charged us with protecting,\" the Vodkatrog ruler said. He turned and looked behind him at where Lanaktallan females and calfs were moving around the high tech yurts, looking at the gardens, and milling around nervously. A few of the younger ones were looking up and talking to the massive cyborgs standing still in the middle of the area.\n\nSangbre watched as the massive cyborg slowly stood up and walked to where the transports had taken off. The grass and flowers were untouched by the counter-grav, just a slight  twisted, almost runic pattern left behind. She hustled after him, Captain Manners right behind her.\n\nThe huge warlord of the Tuvan Warsteel Horde stopped and slowly, carefully turned around before kneeling again. He leaned his head down close to Sangbre, who managed to avoid flinching at the smell of lubricants, hot warsteel, and steam. The cyborg's eyes were red and his customized head looked like a warsteel skull with horns and fangs.\n\n\"My chrome witches have warned me, have warned all of the Warsteel Cossack Warlords, that should we fail to protect these innocent ones, then we fail in our eternal duty to Mother Rossiya,\" the cyborg said softly. \"We vodkatrogs are strong, strong as warsteel, but we are defined by our mercy, or willingness to protect those weaker than ourselves.\"\n\nSangbre nodded, carefully and slowly. She had read that these people were touchy at the best of times, prideful and easily offended in the ways of honor.\n\n\"The witches, they wish to see you. See the Mother of the Defiant One with their own blind eyes,\" the warlord rumbled. He made a motion and a smaller cyborg, only three meters tall, moved up. \"D-Mee3 will take you to them,\" he leaned a slight bit closer. \"You will be the first non-vodkatrog to enter Mother Rossiya's embrace since the Glassing.\"\n\nThe new one, D-Mee3, gave a short, curt bow and straightened up. He held out one finger, where a sharp  gleaming spike was raised up. \"I must have a drop of blood from each of you. It is tradition.\"\n\nCaptain Manners stepped forward, tapping his palm against the spike. Sangbre saw it gleam with a drop of blood for a moment then there was a faint crackle.\n\nMatron Sangbre had been exposed to enough of TerraSol's culture to know better than to back down, to show any fear, and she stepped forward and touched her catching hand's palm pad to the spike. She felt it flicker into her skin and withdraw.\n\nD-Mee3 nodded and stepped back.\n\n\"Follow me,\" the crude appearing cyborg said, leading Matron Sangbre toward one of the caves in the cliff that bordered the area that the Cyborg Warlord of Vodkatrog Siberia had promised to defend. Sangbre had learned that the apparent crudity was an aesthetic choice, something to do with a long ago conflict that they could barely remembered called the War of the Bear and the Eagle.\n\nThey moved into the cave, the mouth opening into a much larger space full of gantries, loading mechanisms, and everything else needed to keep a Cyber-Cossack in fighting condition. It felt old to Sangbre in a way that she couldn't describe, despite the fact she knew it was less than 10,000 years old.\n\nBeyond the cave was an elevator large enough to fit a dozen of the massive Warlord they had left outside. It felt strange to Sangbre that the three of them were the only occupants as the cage door rattled shut and the elevator began to move downward.\n\n\"We journey into the arms and bosom of Mother Rossiya,\" D-Mee3 intoned. \"Here our ancestors, our forebearers, worked in honest labor to earn an honest ruble. For centuries they worked, generation after generation, all working deep beneath the earth.\"\n\nHe motioned at the wall and Sangbre realized with a shock that there were skulls staring at her. Human skulls. Rows and rows of them cemented into the wall of the elevator shaft.\n\n\"We placed our dead to watch over us, to keep us safe, their names for all to see,\" D-Mee3 said.\n\nSangbre realized that there were names carved into the skulls, the carving inlaid with some kind of glittering white crystalline substance.\n\n\"My ancestors look upon me, Tnvaru,\" D-Mee3 said. \"Can you say the same?\"\n\n\"No,\" Sangbre breathed. \"I was stolen from their sight.\"\n\nThe ride was silent for a few minutes, slowly moving past the row after row after row of engraved skulls. It suddenly hissed and came to a stop. D-Mee3 moved up next to Sangbre and pointed at a grouping of skulls.\n\n\"These are the Childless Ones,\" he said, his voice somber. \"Your hand.\"\n\nSangbre gripped her gripping stick tightly as she held out one of her catching hands. D-Mee3 lifted a finger and a blade popped out. Sangbre looked at Captain Manners, who just nodded, his face serious. Before she could look back the cyborg had cut her palm-pad, gashing it so that blood oozed.\n\nSangbre gritted her teeth at the pain but showed no other sign of it as the cyborg pulled her forward and pushed her hand against the forehead of one of the skulls. Her blood soaked into the crystals on the forehead, the slash starting to burn. Sparks, then flickers of red, blue, and white lightning began to move down Sangbre's arm and she clamped her jaws to keep from crying out as it covered her in a cocoon.\n\n\"She sees you,\" D-Mee3 intoned as the white crystals in the eyes turned slowly red. \"She accepts you.\"\n\nThe lightning vanished, leaving Sangbre gasping.\n\nThe cyborg released Sangbre's burning hand and stepped back. The elevator started to move again. Sangbre looked at her hand, noting the way crystals glimmered in the wound, how the bleeding had somehow staunched. She sniffed it, then lapped at the wound.\n\nSodium chloride.\n\nSalt.\n\n\"A sea died here to give our people life,\" D-Mee3 said. \"We dug deep, and we left our mark where we had been.\"\n\nThe elevator came to a stop and Sangbre swallowed thickly.\n\n\"You will need this,\" the cyborg said, stepping forward with a face-mask. She pulled it on, inhaling and feeling air rush against her face as Captain Manners put one on. The cyborg looked at Captain Manners. \"Long ago, your forefathers labored here too. Your ancestors see you, Space Force.\"\n\nCaptain Manners gave a slight jerky bow as the heavy door slid open.\n\nThe cavern was dark ahead and Sangbre followed the cyborg into the darkness. Her skin prickled with the feel of low air pressure as her shoes clanged against the floor panels that made up the walkway. She was halfway across when the lights slowly came on.\n\nMatron Sangbre gasped and stopped, looking around her.\n\nSalt had been carved to look like the front of buildings. Salt stalagmites had been carved to look like people, the stalactites had been carved to look like what Sangbre had learned were angels. The details, the artisanship was undeniable and it took her breath away.\n\nIt was all carved of salt.\n\n\"Our forefathers, and yours, created art to bring life to these caverns, beneath the earth,\" D-Mee3 said, still leading them forward until they entered tunnels.\n\nThe tunnels were carved on every inch of the walls and ceilings. Human faces, animals, pillars, windows, building facades.\n\n\"Then the Mantid Attack came,\" D-Mee3 said. \"Many of our people died, but many more fled down here, to the mines.\"\n\n\"How long must live as troglodytes?\" a woman's angry voice asked as they passed a statue of a woman with heavy cybernetic arms that were obviously designed to help her mine. \"Crouching down here while others fight to wrest our planet back from the bug men?\"\n\nIn the next cave a crowd was gathered to listen to a woman in front of bas-relief of a cave. The crowd was full of cyborgs, all of them slated for mining to Sangbre's eyes.\n\nAll carved from salt.\n\n\"Are we going to huddle in the darkness and drink vodka till the Mantids kill us all? Or will we fight?\" the woman's voice was angry. \"What will you do when the vodka is gone?\"\n\nAnother cave, another carved diaroma done life-sized.\n\n\"Troglodytes the city dwellers called us when they mocked us! Perhaps, but the legends all agree, troglodytes would leave their caves at night and kill those who displeased them,\" the woman's passion was fiery and Sangbre found herself nodding with it as she looked at the salt statue of the woman, who had her fist upraised. The crowd had their fists upraised. \"Let the Mantid fear us then! We dwell in darkness and rule the night and the Mantid have displeased us!\"\n\nThe next few caves had mining cyborgs fighting against the Mantid, crushing them with hammers, splitting them apart with jackhammers, ripping them apart with rock chewers.\n\n\"MOTHER ROSSIYA WILL NOT YIELD!\" a hundred voices bellowed out in the next cave. \"VODKA, WARSTEEL, AND BLOOD!\"\n\nThe tunnels became more winding, leading downward, became tighter. Still D-Mee3 led them on until finally he stopped next to a door made entirely of Mantid skulls.\n\n\"Beyond here are the Daughter's of Chrome Baba-Yaga, who hunted in the night in a hut carried by Mantid Speaker legs,\" D-Mee3 said. He rapped on the door and then looked at Captain Manners. \"Their words are for the Tnvaru Matron Sangbre and her alone.\"\n\nCaptain Manners nodded, folding his arms and waiting.\n\nThe door swung open and Sangbre entered the darkness beyond, her hands holding tight to her gripping stick.\n\nThe door shut behind her.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time the door opened and Sangbre half fell out, catching herself barely and leaning heavily on her gripping stick, breathing hard.\n\nThe door shut silently.\n\nShe looked up at Captain Manners with warsteel eyes, the fur around her eyes stark white. She had a red streak in her fur from the back of her head, up between her ears, down between her eyes, and to the point of her nose.\n\n\"The Unified Council is coming. We must get the refugees to the Defiant Caverns,\" she gasped. She looked at D-Mee3. \"Hurry, Faithful One. Do not let the blood of innocents spill upon Mother Rossiya's bosom.\"\n\nThe bulky crude looking cyborg bowed. \"As you say.\n\n\"Matron.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ibvnx9/first_contact_282_total_war_the_confederacy/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/icexj1/first_contact_284_total_war_terrasol/)\\]",

    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

He was talking to one of the Human pilots as the ambassadors were all having appropriately prepared nutrient bars.  Worlid always found ambassadors were too careful with what they said, it was better to get to those escorting them if you wanted the truth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“That’s a Shemp?  I am so sorry!” Howard replied in shock, his skin changing to a slightly reddish hue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe poor Shemp laid there naked and limp.  His race’s natural defense was to go limp when threatened, which he promptly did when picked up by the Human.  Unfortunately, this would not have been the first time they lost a Shemp to a new race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorlid watched as the Human proceeded to take Xi’tel to the sink and dunk the Shemp into the water a few times before piling his decorative shell back on him.  ‘The Shemp probably be fine,’ he thought to himself,  'well, after some therapy...'\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“My god, I hope that the cocktail sauce I dipped him in doesn’t hurt him too badly.” Howard was obviously distraught over the near catastrophe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorlid looked the Human over carefully.  Worlid’s species was mineral based and generally got along well with everything except the plant-based species.  That is partially why they were normally selected to meet new species.\n\n \n\nAnd they don’t get much newer than the humans.  They had only developed FTL because of a failed invasion attempt of their homeworld.  Not even a generation had passed since they suddenly discovered they weren’t alone.  They hadn’t been properly introduced to all the races.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Tell me, what does your race normally eat?”  The human’s features appeared to have both carnivorous and herbivore features.  Something rather rare among the higher functioning creatures in the universe, Worlid mused. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Uhm, well we are Omnivores.  But we don’t like to eat anything sapient.” Howard responded.  He still looked shocked and kept looking back at the Shemp.  He obviously missed that he had the attention of every Xeno within earshot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, this will be fun, thought Worlid.  “Omnivorous you say?  That means your kind eats meat and plants!  How do you determine if something is sapient?” He exclaimed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe could see the discomfort on the faces of all around him.  The humans had made a name for themselves early on when attacked by the Sikleta.   The Sikleta were some of the most feared predators in the galaxy, eating any fleshy creature they could catch. The humans not only stopped them but captured and reversed engineered their technology.  The following counterattack had been so vicious the Sikleta had actually turned to the council for protection.  Centuries of raids against the other council races had stopped overnight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Well…  “Howard started, suddenly aware of all the eyes upon him.  “Its self-awareness.  The ability of abstract thought, empathy, and such.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorlid features were impossible to read, being mostly solid.  But he was enjoying the obvious discomfort of the many other Xenos around him.  “So your species would never eat a Sapient?  How can they tell if one is?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoward looked a little uncomfortable, “Generally by their demonstrated behavior.  And most of us wouldn’t eat a Sapient… there have been a couple of incidents in extreme situations.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorlid had heard the rumors, but he was enjoying the nervous looks of the Xenos around.  Occasionally he would catch as they glanced at the Shemp and then back to the Human.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Perhaps you can elaborate on some of the foods native to your world? For Xi’tel’s sake, maybe start with what you mistook him for?” Worlid asked.  A part of him loving the fact that every race present was nervous to be around an omnivore.  He was glad to be mineral based, Xi’tel still wasn’t moving but looked to be watching.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Well…” Howard started looking towards the Shemp, “ he looked like a shrimp.  “We serve them as appetizers with cocktail sauce before big meals.  We eat a lot of meat and vegetables to sustain ourselves.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoward’s admission causing several nearby Xenos to step back.  Seeing his opportunity, Worlid couldn’t help but ask, “What about fruit?”  He knew a Yanga was behind Howard.  They would gladly have fed on him.   He knew they were sensitive to the fact most herbivores loved their fruit, which was their young.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Yeah, we eat fruit too.  Even make medicine with bark sometimes.  We also do a lot with the wood.” Howard answered, oblivious to the look of terror on the Yanga behind him.  Worlid could not think of anything that could make this better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorlid was enjoying this, “Well at least you don’t eat your own kind.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoward looked really uncomfortable, “Well… there have been a few occasions where Humans have done that, but cannibalism is very rare.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this, even the carnivores present backed off some.  Worlid was momentarily speechless, he looked at Howard a long moment, trying to determine if he was serious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“But we would only do that as a last resort, generally anything else will get eaten first,” Howard explained, completely oblivious to the impact this was having on the other Xenos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“The Sikleta claimed your race had eaten some of them?” Worlid carefully broached the topic warily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Well, when they attacked earth, they burned our crops… they also killed a lot of our domestic animals.  They caused massive food shortages.  So when their colony ship landed… and they looked like feral pigs... well, we had to eat something.” Howard responded.  Worlid was a little taken aback, he had heard the reports, but had thought the Sikleta had made it up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, he was much happier to be a mineral based race.  In the food cycle, it seemed only he was safe.  So far, it sounded like he was the only Xeno present not on the menu if they got stuck.  It seemed Sodium Chloride was about the only thing these creatures didn’t eat.  He had heard them refer to it as a food pyramid, but it wasn’t driven home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was until Howard continued, “They actually taste great with a little ground salt.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Author’s Note: I know it’s short and not one of my better pieces, but was a moment of madness I needed to get out to work on other stories… guess I’m hungry.  As always, I hope you enjoy and open to feedback.*",

Unless you have anything to add, Lady Githaiy?\"\n\nGithaiy suppressed a sigh as the two of them kept walking through the hallways.\n\n\"Lord Jarkiyna, I am by no means here to undermine your authority,\" she insisted to the head physician of the Calhanar Hospital. \"Her Highness simply wishes that the transport of her brother happens without any trouble.\"\n\n\"I am more than sufficient to ensure that,\" the head physician retorted.\n\n\"Tell her that. I am simply following her orders. Or do you want me to ignore them?\"\n\n\"O-of course not! I'm just saying that sending two doctors of... at least *comparable* qualifications are excessive!\"\n\nGithaiy once again didn't let her feelings show. She knew Doctor Jarkiyna was fully aware that their qualifications were more than just \"comparable\". But as the royal physician, she technically outranked him despite her being \"only\" a baronetess. Most nobles, especially those from older clans, usually didn't like that.\n\nGranted, she didn't know for sure if that was really what had ticked him off. She might have told him otherwise, but the fact that she was here insinuated that Her Highness didn't fully trust his abilities. Maybe she should have answered in a less confrontational manner.\n\n\"I agree, it *is* a bit much. But please, don't understand this as her mistrusting you. She is simply worried about her brother.\"\n\n*I'd wish she would treat her own health with the same level of care. But as long as I am her subordinate, all I can do is give her my advice. If she insists on not following it, there is nothing I can do.*\n\n\"And to be completely honest, she has been under a lot of stress lately, so don't hold it against it her.\"\n\nA sigh from Jarkiyna was the answer.\n\n\"I guess you are right. Besides, it might not be that excessive after all. Since we are approaching the long rain, the weather is a bit unstable. The shuttle will be forced to fly slower, so in the worst case, it might take us an entire day to reach Viyrminar. We can take turns in monitoring his condition.\"\n\n\"A good idea.\"\n\n\"Oh, First Ones, get a room you two!\"\n\nThe sudden call from the sickbed reminded the two that they weren't alone. They had been walking alongside the assistants who were currently in the process of transporting the young prince to the landing platform. Apparently, as the discussion had grown a bit heated, both of them had forgotten about their surroundings.\n\n\"I apologize, Your Highness,\" Jarkiyna said with a bow. \"The behavior I displayed was highly unprofessional.\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" Githaiy added. \"I am not familiar with the phrase you used though, so I assume it's from Nadine?\"\n\n\"M-maybe.\"\n\n\"Figured,\" Githaiy chuckled. Maybe she should one day ask the small alien what some of her more curious idioms meant. \"Say, Your Highness, you wouldn't happen to know what the request to \"get a room\" is supposed to convey?\"\n\n\"I, uh, no. Nadine said she'd explain it when I'm older.\"\n\nWhen he was older? Why would one's age be a relevant factor in that? Well, that was a topic for a different day. For now, they had reached the ambulance shuttle. While the assistants carried the injured prince inside, Githaiy and Jarkiyna did one final check that they had everything. Kiyrtin's injuries were almost entirely external, so they didn't need many monitoring devices. The most important things were bandages, hardening agents, and larco-resin, in case a new tear opened in his shell.\n\n*I guess the silver lining is that he only touched Nadine with his front side. Thanks to that, he can at least more or less safely lie on his back. Let's hope we don't get caught in a storm.*\n\nThere shouldn't be one according to the forecast, but flying to the other side of the planet was a long journey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe flight was mostly uneventful up until around ten invas after the start. Kiyrtin had fallen asleep a while ago when the datapad of the head physician gave off a message sound.\n\n\"Something important?\" Githaiy asked, more for the sake of small talk than actual interest.\n\n\"Lab report,\" her colleague murmured. \"Her Highness managed to acquire a sample of the unknown substance that put the prince in this situation.\"\n\n*Ah, right, that story,* Githaiy thought. *Though I wasn't aware she sent in a sample of Nadine's sweat. Well, I wanted to do a thorough analysis myself, so I won't complain.*\n\n\"Could you send me the report later?\"\n\n\"Sure. Okay, let's see... water-based solution, containing traces of ammonia, potassium, sodium chloride, something... that is unknown but potentially toxic, a variety of salts... what in the world is that concoction?\"\n\nGithaiy did her best not to chuckle at that remark. What her colleague would say if he knew the true origin of this?\n\n\"Just what were they trying to achieve with this?\" he mumbled as he kept reading. \"Or was it maybe a byproduct? But even then what was the... hm? WHAT BY THE FIRST ONES...?!\"\n\nThe sudden outcry made Githaiy perk up. That reaction *after* already going through the previous contents... was there something Nadine hadn't told her?\n\n\"What does it say?\" she carefully asked.\n\n\"The solution contains an insane variety of microbes! All of them unknown! A plethora of Bacteria, Viruses, and something uncategorized!\"\n\n\"Pathogenic?\" questioned, shocked by what she had just heard. It wasn't that rare that a species had one or two types of symbiotic microbes in their body, but this amount... and what was the unidentifiable thing?\n\n\"I, uh... probably not? I mean, his Highness is fine right? I will definitely give this to the Viyrminar hospital, but we examined his highness often and thoroughly. We would have noticed if he had shown any symptoms.\"\n\nThat was true. Maybe it didn't affect them because they were used to Nadine's organism, which was so fundamentally different from the Vanaery? Still, she needed to look into this, just to be sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey reached the planet's capital, the great city of Viyrminar after a bit under a day. Sleeping in the shuttle hadn't exactly offered the most satisfying rest, but the prince's well-being was more important at the moment. After Kiyrtin had safely reached his new hospital room, Jarkiyna announced that he would stay for a few days to make sure everything went over smoothly. Githaiy on the other hand went back immediately to not be absent from the palace for too long.\n\nThe ride home was expected to go faster because there was no need to fly as carefully as before. Despite being tired, Githaiy did her best to stay awake so as to not mess up her sleep cycle. But apparently, she had dosed off for a moment as the pilot's voice tore her out of her stupor.\n\n\"Milady?\"\n\n\"Mh? Huh, what?\"\n\n\"It's now the 17th inva in Calhanar. You wanted me to tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, thank you.\"\n\nIf they went by schedule - which was to be expected - the negotiations should have a break right now. As Githaiy issued a call to the Star Palace, the servant in charge informed her that her Highness was indeed free at the moment, and after a short waiting period, the princess's face appeared on the screen.\n\n\"Doctor,\" she greeted. \"Is there an issue?\"\n\n\"Not so far, Your Highness. I merely wanted to inform you that your brother's transport went over without any problems.\"\n\n\"That's good to hear. Do you know when you will return?\"\n\n\"Probably not until tonight, you will likely be already in bed by then. But I also called for another reason. How are your headaches?\"\n\nWith a worried expression, the princess took a long pause before answering.\n\n\"In all honesty, it's been getting worse. During yesterday's negotiations, I did... I did exactly what I wanted to prevent from happening. And I don't feel like the medicine is working.\"\n\nNo effect? Sure, she had given the princess a weaker version of the medicine, but there still should've been a noticeable improvement. Maybe the headaches weren't from the stress. But what then? Headaches were unfortunately a symptom that could have a plethora of causes.\n\n\"Did you notice anything else?\"\n\n\"Um, I... don't think so?\"\n\nThat wasn't helpful.\n\n\"Can you cancel the talks for the rest of the day?\"\n\n\"Actually, today aren't any. Lady Kykla proposed a day off so I could rest.\"\n\nGithaiy needed a moment to process what she just heard.\n\n\"The Tystrie ambassador?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Your condition is so bad that even the *Tystrie ambassador* proposed a break?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I hope you are taking it. Treat yourself with care. If it gets worse, don't hesitate to call for another doctor. I don't know how long exactly the rest of the flight will take, but if you're still awake when I come back I will take a closer look. If not, come to me first thing in the morning.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sun had long disappeared when Githaiy finally reached the Star Palace. Tired from the long flight, she entered through the side entrance and made her way to the west wing. While the lights in the corridor were still on, not a single servant was in sight around the princess's room. This could only mean Her Highness had already gone to sleep. There was also no one waiting for her. Relieved that it at least hadn't gotten worse, and glad that the princess had gone to bed early for once, Githaiy entered her office, and through it her private chambers. Her tiredness won as soon as she laid down and she fell asleep.\n\nShe didn't know how long she had been sleeping. All she knew was that a loud and obnoxious beeping noise made her wake up. Why was her alarm clock going off? It was still the middle of the night!\n\nNo, this wasn't her alarm clock. This was the emergency alert. Great, so it wasn't enough for Prince Kiyrtin to annoy her during the day, now he even had to rob her of her night's rest. And the worst part? To make sure she wouldn't miss it, she had made it so the alarm wouldn't stop on its own. She actually had to get up and open the door to turn it off.\n\n...wait, Kiyrtin was at the hospital.\n\nIn an instant, she was fully awake and practically jumped out of her bed. Whoever this was, if they pressed the emergency button in the middle of the night, it was important. She was just about to leave her bedroom when suddenly, she froze upon hearing some sort of impact, so violent that it made the floor vibrate. What by the First Ones was that?\n\nA second impact made her overcome the moment of shock. She ran through her small living room, but her left foot got caught on the doorstep, she stumbled into her office and fell to the ground - which was luckily cushioned by the soft carpet. Just as she pulled up her head and looked towards the entrance, the third impact hit.\n\nWith the sound of metal failing its duty, the lock got ripped out of the doorframe. The door burst open, crashing into the adjacent wall with so much force that the upper hinge broke apart. In the corridor, there stood Nadine, one foot raised. The door and lock were - or, well, had been - reinforced, just like all doors in the palace. Had she seriously just... *kicked* it open?\n\nBut before Githaiy could voice her bafflement, she noticed the princess's unconscious body draped over the small alien's shoulder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rmacpo/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_1/)\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ym1api/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_34/)\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/zcqfwd/the_princess_and_the_human_ch_36/)",

If you couldn’t tell by my Redditor name, I love dragons. I know it may seem weird and childish for someone who’s 16 years old, but that’s just the way I ended up I guess. I’ve recently discovered a series called Wings Of Fire, and it feels like it was MADE for me. I’d explain the plot and stuff but I don’t want this post getting too long. Now, my Aunt. Oh boy. Here in the UK, Karens are a rarity compared to what seems to go down in the US. But this lady ticks all the checks. Overly controlling, thinks the world revolves around her, believes in stupid stuff she read on totally trustworthy websites (/s), owns annoying pets and refuses to teach them to behave, and of course is Christian. (I’m not saying you’re not allowed to believe in Jesus, if you wanna do that go ahead. This lady just takes it to a whole new level though) she even has the stereotypical haircut. She even almost killed me once, but that’s a story for another day. Also, my parents also don’t like this woman as well for all the reasons I do, but don’t want to cut her completely out of our life since they’d feel bad, and they feel she’s bearable. Plus, her 2 offsprings are surprisingly sane & nice people.\n\nAnyway, onto what happened.\n\nHere’s the usual cast blah blah blah:\n\nOP- Me\n\nEA- Entitled Aunt\n\nSM- Step-Mum\n\nD- Dad\n\nMy aunt decided a few days ago she’d come round our house to just say hello and do the normal middle aged mum thing of have a chat while their kids just wander around waiting to leave. We were told she was coming in advance and of course my parents, not wanting to come across as rude, let her. It had been a while since I had last seen her for obvious reasons, and hadn’t started my dumb obsession with Wings of Fire back when I had last seen her.\n\nAnyway, so EA comes in, says her usual greetings to SM & D and then comes and greets me, in my room, playing games and just trying not to say the wrong thing (trust me the slightest thing can set off this woman). I have the WoF book that i’m currently reading through. (Moon Rising) on my table next to my games, and it’s literally one of the first things she sees. Obviously, a book about dragons would have a dragon on the cover, so she instantly puts two and two together and figures out the book is about those funny looking winged lizards. Instantly, she starts off saying stuff like ‘You shouldn’t be reading those evil books, OP!!1!’ and ‘Dragons are an embodiment of Satan, I will NOT have my cousin raised on Satanic books!1!!1’ because apparently in her totally believable book of biblical wisdom there was something about dragons & satan being connected. Same book that said homosexuality was a sin, just sayin’.\n\nWanting to stop her tirade, SM & D pull her out of my room, apologise profusely for her shut the door. Thankfully she’s not dumb enough to try and come back in, though I can still hear her vaguely speaking in that hush shocked tone of voice judgemental people do when telling people how to raise their kids, though I can’t make out what she’s saying. I end up laughing hysterically over her mini rant over how apparently a book series meant for 10 year olds is demonic, and go back to playing my game.\n\nLater on, after she leaves (she didn’t even bother saying goodbye to me lmfao) D & SM sit me down and have a chat about what she said to them. Apparently she thought I was being brainwashed by the devil and being made to go down an evil path.. she literally straight up said the author of the WoF books worships the devil and drinks baby blood… you can’t make this shit up, honestly. SM & D reassure me i’m not in any trouble and just wanted to share what unhinged BS she had to share because they’d know i’d get a good laugh out of it, and damn I did.\n\nSo here I am, on reddit, telling this story to you. I knew my aunt was crazy before, but this is new levels. What a squid-brain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[UPDATE: Entitled Aunt sends my Wings Of Fire book to the shadow realm](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/yjsdld/update_entitled_aunt_sends_my_wings_of_fire_book/) \\- November 1, 2022\n\nUh, so remember my entitled aunt from my previous post? If you don’t or didn’t see it, she basically thinks a book about dragons stopping an ancient dragon on a murder spree is satanic and that it’s brainwashing me. I know, pretty full on enough. But what happened to me a few hours ago was just so unhinged, It’s literally taken me until just now to comprehend what happened.\n\nSince the events of last story, my parents and I have basically gone no contact with EA (Entitled Aunt), which is a lot harder than it sounds due to her offspring being genuinely nice people and not christian nutbags like her (Nothing wrong with being Christian, it’s when you start thinking ‘ANYTHING WITH SCALES IS THE DEVIL AND MUST BE KILLED AT ALL COST 😡😡😡😡😡’, then it’s beyond too much) and we don’t want to cut them out too.\n\nAnyway, onto this batshit story.\n\nI’m currently going to a type of school that isn’t really a school per se, more of a ‘know how to act in the workplace and get insight on the job you want’ type place. Quite laid back place and we do a lot of fun stuff there. Normally I would have picked up these skills earlier, but due to my autism, Aspergers and major health problems that kept me off school for a couple years (i’m fine now dw), I never really got to pick those up.\n\nBasically everyone in my family knows where I go, even my Entitled Aunt’s side somehow despite us never telling them. Most likely through relatives telling other relatives, idk. Anyway, this was the problem, knowing where I went.\n\nWe finish our work early today so we get 10 minutes to do whatever as long as it isn’t disruptive or overly loud. ‘School’ ends at 3:00pm, and it’s 2:50pm now. A lot of people just go outside to smoke and wait for the day to be over but me, being the nerd I am, decide to have a quick read through the next chapter of my Wings Of Fire book. Moonwatcher has visions again, Qibli’s a witty gigachad and Winter is just as insufferable as ever. I finish up my chapter just as it turns 3pm and i go outside, still holding my book by my arm. SM (Step-Mum) is waiting for me outside (yes i still get picked up from school at 16, i live a solid few miles from my school don’t judge). She asks me how my day was, the usual stuff. We’re about to get into the car when I hear a voice that just about makes me shit myself. EA’s voice. ‘STOP!’ I turn around to see her walking towards me like she just came out of a fucking Jo-Jo episode. ‘I TOLD YOU OP TO NOT READ THOSE BOOKS, THEY’RE MAKING YOU EVIL!’\n\nMe: ‘Excuse me but how in the world did you get here in the first place?’\n\nEA: ‘I’ve been waiting for you for ages to come out with those NASTY books so I can finally take them off you. I don’t want your mind getting any more corrupted by Satanism than it already is!’\n\nAt this point I just started hysterically laughing because it’s been implied she’s been waiting outside for days now just to take my books. SM loses it at her and tries to get her the fuck away from me, but EA somehow manages to snatch the book off me while my guard is down. Me & SM immediately go to try and take it back but before we can, she… well you read the title. She slams the book on the dirty pavement (keep in mind it had been raining), picks it up again (ew) and starts ripping it into pieces. I pretend to be hysterical and crying because oh no! She’s ruined my book! If only I had a spare copy so I could continue! Oh wait I totally have a spare copy lmao. Yep by some miracle Moon Rising is the ONE Wings of Fire book I have a duplicate of due to a miscommunication with my Uncle who’s really nice but, and i mean this in the kindest way possible, a little thick. I don’t tell her this & SM knows about my duplicate as well. SM just glares at EA holding the soggy, tattered book. ‘You know, I could call the police on you now for damaging personal property…’\n\nEA, just now realising the gravity of the situation and for some reason now holding ‘’holy’’ totally not tap water, throws the book on the ground, yeets the water at me and legs it. We did try reporting this to the police but they said there wasn’t enough evidence sadly and due to the area being quiet no-one managed to get it on film. Who knows if my tattered copy of Moon Rising still lays on that pavement right now, i guess we’ll find out tomorrow.\n\nI’m just…done with this lady. She gets more and more cuckoo by the day. I wouldn’t be surprised if she ended up in a mental asylum by the end of the year the rate she’s going lmfao\n\nUpdate: So I woke up today to the news that Karen herself had been investigated by the police anyway despite them saying there wasn’t evidence and apparently when the police arrived she legged it. Police being police caught her and she’s currently under investigation for a whole myriad of charges. Hope that bitch ends up serving some jail time.\n\nUpdate 2: I managed to convince my parents to take legal action, we’re currently seeing if we can get a restraining order put in place like everyone said I should. Karen is still under investigation, but it ain’t looking too good for her thankfully. Oh, and the book isn’t there anymore unfortunately. Some trash-man must have got rid of it. One final thing, some people asked about where my uncle is in all of this, and, well, simple answer is he divorced Karen after she almost killed me lmao, i’ll get to that story once everything legal and that is over and done with. I’ll keep y’all posted on how this develops.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wings of Entitled Parents: The Final Chapter. Entitled Aunt almost KILLS me & tries to adopt me against my & my dad’s will](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/109c03a/wings_of_entitled_parents_the_final_chapter/) \\- January 11, 2023\n\nHey there. Been a solid minute huh? If you don’t recognise me or missed my last few posts, my insane aunt destroyed my book from my beloved Wings Of Fire collection. It’s about dragons. Used to think my obsession considering my age (16) was weird but i’ve learned not a lot of people’s gonna judge someone based on their taste of 10yo-aimed books. Anyway, enough rambling, let’s get into what’s happened and the story i promised about how she was almost responsible for my death.\n\nFirst, what happened after my story about her sending my book to The Backrooms. Long story short, Big Karen got slapped into jail for a solid few weeks for assault of a minor and a few other charges, we reported what happened to the authorities and she broke down as soon as she was investigated. We also managed to get a restraining order put in place on her. Not gonna get into more detail than that since it’s boring legal stuff.\n\nNow, the big story. The one you’ve all been waiting for.\n\nMy mother was very ill during this story and due to the illness (not gonna say what for personal reasons) everyone except naive 11yo me knew she wasn’t gonna make it. Due to my father drowning in paperwork that needed to be finished ASAP to sort out my mother’s illness he decided it was best for me to stay round my Aunt & Uncle’s place for a few weeks until everything was sorted out. Lot of people wondered where my Uncle was in all this and here he is, he’s since divorced my Aunt since he couldn’t deal with her BS presumably which is why he was never mentioned in the previous story. Anyway, first few days went fine, this was before my Aunt went all christian and crazy presumably to try and make up for this incident. ‘I’vE cHaNgEd Op!! I’m FoLlOwInG tHe LoRd NoW!!’ my brother in christ you sound like the pope took cocaine. (Not offending anyone christian BTW, you believe what you want) Anyway, after a few days, i start feeling unwell. It’s nothing, just a cold, right? Right?…..I fucking wish it was. Shit REALLY hit the fan after that, i couldn’t lay down without my back or anywhere else aching like crazy, i felt absolutely wrecked 99.9% of the time, i had no appetite, and i was vomiting like every day. HUGE Red flag to my aunt, right? Nope, she just dismissed it as stress due to my ill mother. Even when i requested to go to the hospital she just said ‘it’s just your stress from your mother, try not to worry about it’ LIKE BITCH DOES MY ENTIRE BODY ACHING 24/7 SAY STRESS TO YOU?? CAUSE I DON’T THINK SO. At this point my Dad realises shit’s going so far south we’re basically at Antarctica so he tries to get involved but never can do. Not because of paperwork this time, because of what i was unaware of until very recently. I’ll get into that later. Eventually after a few more days of living in hell my dad just says ‘fuck it’ and gets me to the hospital without my aunt’s permission and gets a blood test done. The result? I HAD FUCKING LEUKAEMIA. Treatment happened ASAP and thank FUCK I lived to tell the tale. I’m doing fine now, don’t worry. But my dad told me something about her after she got sent to the clink which just baffled me. I knew this lady was insane but the levels of insanity of tried to do behind my back the english language does not have a suitable word for. She tried to adopt me from my Dad, against his will. That’s right. Apparently she thought the only reason my Dad dropped me off there was because he didn’t WANT to take care of me, not because he COULDN’T for the moment. That could not be further from the truth, my Dad is an amazing person who would love their child as much as any sane person would. But… that’s why he never came round. My Aunt refused him over. The levels of absolute audacity… it’s unreal. If I knew any better, i’d go so far as to call this attempted murder.\n\nI’m gonna close this post by saying thanks for all the comments on the last 2 posts about this Bitch. It’s thanks to you my family decided to take the steps needed to hold this Rhinoceros accountable. Hopefully I never encounter this waste of a human being again. And sorry about the long gap between this post & the last one, we were getting everything legal sorted out and i wanted to make sure this story was DEFINITELY over.\n\n **Reminder - I am not the original poster.**",

Drinking any water with a higher salt concentration than that will lead to an osmotic imbalance. Now, when you're  talking about drinking water in a survival situation, you always hear that drinking seawater will kill you, but in fact a small amount of seawater can be used to extend your available water supply, provided it is diluted (or rather, that on average, salt intake is reduced) below the 0.9% normal equivalent. Thus, for every part seawater you ingest, you must also ingest a minimum of three equal parts of fresh water (3.5%/4 = 0.875%) for that to be a viable survival tactic.\n\nEdit:  It has been pointed out to me that my description of the physiology of salt elimination in the body is inaccurate. There are many posts in this thread by medical subject matter experts with more accurate descriptions of both the physiological processes at work in the elimination of salts, and the quantitative information regarding tolerable ingestible concentrations and typical blood chemistry. Nevertheless, I stand by the practical survival advice of 1:3, 1:4, or better integer ratio of seawater to fresh water for extending a fresh water supply in a survival scenario.",

        "body": "The reason that sea water is a problem is that its sodium chloride concentrations are at, or just above, the maximum concentrating ability of the human kidney, so in order to remove salt that is in excess of your body's needs, it must excrete an equal (or slightly greater) amount of water than the salt was in.\n\nAt night when human antidiuretic hormone secretion is at its diurnal peak, we produce urine with an osmolarity of \\~1,200 mOsm/L ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709207/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709207/)). The body does this in order to minimize the amount of urine you make so that you don't have to get up more often to go pee in the middle of the night and can get better rest. It's helpful because while we're sleeping we're not taking in additional fluid, so minimizing the amount of free water that we eliminate while we're not drinking any more maintains homeostasis.\n\nSea water is more or less the same as 3% sodium chloride that is used to treat symptomatic hyponatremia, so I'll just use that as an example. The osmolarity of 3% saline solution is \\~1,000 mOsm/L.\n\nSo let's imagine that you are in a situation where you only have sea water to drink and you're thirsty. The thirst suggests that your body serum osmolarity has risen to \\~290 mOsm/L (normal is \\~280 mOsm/L), which is usually due to enough free water loss (by sweat, diarrhea, voiding, whatever) to raise your serum sodium by 5 points.\n\nBecause you're thirsty and surrounded by sea water you drink 1,200 mL of 3% saline. This solution is very hypertonic to your plasma, which would normally be fine as your kidneys could just excrete the salt and hang on to the water, but because it's \\*so\\* concentrated, your kidneys will need to get rid of 1,000 mL (the denominator of the maximum concentrating ability) of of the 1,200 mL that you drank in order to get rid of all the NaCl (per the maximum concentrating ability cited above).\n\nThat only covers the salt handling portion of the mental exercise. The kidneys still have to handle excreting quite a lot of other waste products that have osmolar effects and make it so that you don't actually net out +200 mL of H2O from drinking 1,200 mL of 3% saline.\n\ntl;dr: Sea water will eventually dehydrate you because its sodium chloride concentration is higher than the kidney's maximal concentrating ability that can be sustained for long periods of time. Plasma sodium only matters in that as you become dehydrated it will rise, and your kidneys won't be able to lower it using sea water because they're just not good enough.\n\nEdits: Typo fixes, grammar cleanup.",

    "body": "If you’re like a lot of people, you might’ve seen those Chinese noodle pullers and thought to yourself, “that seems cool. I kind of want to learn how to do that”. Then you go online, give it a quick google, and’re greeted an absolutely bewildering mix of discussion on the topic: everything from people that say it’s impossible to makes outside of China, to people playing around with adding nutritional yeast or L-cysteine to mix, to Buzzfeed videos claiming an easy foolproof version.\n\nSo with this post, I want to (1) try clear the air a bit, and clarify what a hand-pulled noodle actually is (2) teach you three different ‘hand-pulled noodles’, for three different skill levels and (3) teach a couple ways to actually enjoy them. It’s… a lot of ground to cover. This is a novella of a post, I know – I’ve actually had to put parts of it in the comments below because I hit reddit’s character limit (40k for a post, who knew?). Save it for later if you’re not in the reading mood. But I hope by the end of it all, you’ll understand – or at least appreciate - Chinese hand pulled noodles a little better.\n\n###What is a hand-pulled noodle?\n\nSo one of the things that makes it awkward to give a ‘recipe’ for hand-pulled noodles is that hand-pulled noodles aren’t really a ‘dish’ per se. They’re a technique. And to make things even more complicated, that English translation of ‘hand pulled’ really refers to **two separate techniques**: *Lamian* and *Chenmian*. \n\nThis distinction’s important. It’s why /u/oliverbabish tried and failed mightily at hand pulled noodles, while Inga Lam over at Buzzfeed seem to make them without a hitch – because Babish was trying to make Lamian (infamously difficult) and Lam was making Chenmian (common enough in home kitchens in China). Some other similarities/differences:\n\nLamian (拉面) | Chenmian (抻面)\n:--|:--|\nMade in restaurants | Made at restaurants or at home\nOften learned by going to special schools or apprenticing | Easy to pick up \nAlkaline Noodles | Non-alkaline Noodles\nRequires a finely milled flour (more on that later) | A finely milled flour is nice, but AP Flour can also be used\nRequires a special type of alkaline called penghui (more on that later) | All you need is flour, water, and salt\nRequires many fancy movements to get it to a pullable consistency, as alkaline stiffens dough | Only needs a long rest (three hours or more) to get to a pullable consistency\nOriginates from the Northwest, Lanzhou specifically, popularized throughout China by the noodle shops that bear its name | Can be found all across north China and even out into other spots in Central Asia\nDelicious | Delicious\n\nNow, both Lamian and Chenmian can come in different shapes. Likely the most classic version of both would be those spaghetti-looking sort, the kind that you’d probably immediately recognize as ‘noodles’. In this shape, Lamian is still called… Lamian. Easy enough. But perhaps confusingly, Chenmian in this shape can also be called Latiaozi (or, in some parts of the country, also Lamian… ugh).\n\nBut besides that, another common shape is wide-and-flat. If following the Lamian method, those flat sort are generally called *kuanmian* (宽面, literally ‘wide noodles’); if following the Chenmian method, they’re called… Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNow, we’ve already covered Biang Biang noodles, but I’ll include them too because they make a *great* introductory pulled noodle. So the way I’ll organize this post is by going over:\n\n1. *Biang Biang Noodles*. Wide-and-flat Chenmian that make for a great ‘my first pulled noodle’.\n\n2. *Chenmian, a.k.a. Latiaozi*. Spaghetti-like Chenmian that’re slightly more involved than Biang Biang (they’re at slightly more risk to break, and are a touch tougher to get thin).\n\n3. *Lamian.* Spaghetti-like alkaline noodles that are… a beast. The mount Everest of Chinese cooking. \n\nBefore we jump in with though, a quick word on flour.\n\n###What flour to use for pulled noodles?\n\nWhenever we do any sort of dough related thing, we end up getting a lot of questions on the subject of “Chinese flour”. Is it bleached? Is it lower gluten? Etc. There seems to be this nagging misperception out there that flour here is somehow materially different than flour in the West.\n\nIn truth, there’s nothing overly different about Western flour and Chinese flour. That’s not to say that everything’s 100% the same – it’s just that that there’s an equally large difference between, say, King Arthur and Gold Metal as there is among those and Chinese brands.\n\nAs always, there’s a few different variables that’re important when picking out flour:\n\n1. *Gluten/Protein content.* For this, we want a high gluten flour. Gives the noodle more bite. For Lamian you want a flour that’s more than 12% protein. For Chenmian, anything over 10% protein should work ok.\n\n2. *Age.* Flour changes as it ages. Fresher flour is stretchier than older flour. In an ideal world, your flour would be less than 6 months old. Matters much more for Lamian than Chenmian (notice a trend?)\n\n3. *Fineness.* The best flour for noodles and dumplings is quite finely milled, akin to an Italian 00 flour. Nice to have for Chenmian, but critical for Lamian.\n\nFor making Lamian, there’s actually a certain brand of flour most of the noodle shops tend to reach for called ‘塞北雪’ – [this is what it looks like, if you’re curious](https://imgur.com/TpccLTw). It’s 12.2% protein, usually used within a couple months of milling, and is extremely finely milled. But while that brand of flour is certainly a beaut to pull noodles with, extremely similar flours *do* exist in the West… in the form of Italian 00 flours.\n\nSo the TL;DR on flour is:\n\n* For Lamian, use an Italian 00 Pizza Flour. In the videos we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour, which’s available online and popular among home pizza makers. It’s finely milled, pretty fresh, and is 13% protein. Works like a charm.\n\n* For Chenmian, 00 Pizza Flour is preferable but not required. All purpose flour is ok, just make sure that it’s not *too* low in protein. Our AP we usually use is 10.8% protein. \n\n**Wait, so for Biang Biang/Chenmian I can use AP Flour?**\n\nYes, that’s right. But you’ll make your life much easier if you do an autolyse first. In both bread and noodle making, this will develop gluten and make for a stretchier end result (hey, just what we want in a pulled noodle!)\n\n* Dissolve your salt with your water, then combine the water with the flour bit by bit\n\n* Knead for ~1 minute until everything comes together\n\n* Cover with a plate, rest for 30 minutes\n\n(note: in Western baking a ‘true’ autolyse is sans salt)\n\n---\n\n###Biang Biang Noodles\n\nSo ‘Biang Biang noodles’ ring a bell, it’s for good reason. Ever hear of the restaurant Xi’an Famous Foods? Began in the basement of a Flushing mall… adored by pretty much everyone including the late Anthony Bourdain… blew up with 15 locations throughout New York… spawned countless copycats throughout the Anglophone world? Biang Biang is the main offering on their menu. It’s a noodle that’s… easy to love. \n\nNow, [that recipe we shared previously?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/axyghr/recipe_biang_biang_noodles_with_chili_oil_topping/). It’s a good recipe. A lot of people’ve enjoyed it. Feel free to continue using that one if you’re already used to it. But by learning a couple basic hand pulled noodle techniques, the process can become even easier, I feel. \n\n**Ingredients, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1.  *00 Pizza Flour, preferably, -or- AP Flour (中筋面粉), 200g.* If you do not use the 00 flour, do that autolyse beforehand.\n\n2. *Salt, ½ tsp.* \n\n3. *Water, 100g.* This dough is 50% hydration. Most pulled noodle doughs will be around that level.\n\n4. *Oil, 3 tbsp.* For coating the dough during resting. \n\n**Techniques, Biang Biang noodles:**\n\nAs befitting something with a grand total of four ingredients and made solely with your hands… pulled noodles are all about technique. Following a recipe for something like pulled noodles would be a little like reading a walkthrough for a game like DOTA 2. A great starting point no doubt, but somewhere along the way the onus falls on you to actually, like… get good.\n\nFor both this one and the following though, luckily that’s not going to be all that difficult. There’s just three techniques that you’ll need to know: hydrating, kneading, and pulling. \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手): A way to evenly hydrate your flour.**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nWhat you’re doing is adding water to flour bit by bit, then rubbing the flour between your thumb and the back of your fingers. What you’re looking for is a final result called ‘suizi’ (i.e. ‘wheat grains’), which looks something [like this](https://imgur.com/LM98kpj). \n\nThe reason evenly hydrating the flour is so important is because we don’t want to add too much water to the dough. This is also one of the reasons why finely 00 milled flour can be so helpful – simply by how well the stuff hydrates.\n\nLike, add 50 grams of water to 100 grams of AP Flour. Do a rough mix with a chopstick, and you’ll get something [like this](https://imgur.com/JLDyxhX). Compare that against those ‘suizi’ from above, which was made with some finely milled 00 with the *same amount of water*. If you’re anything like me, you might look at the first picture and think to yourself, ‘damn, needs more water!’ But it doesn’t need more water – it just needs to be hydrated better.\n\nCat claw + autolyse is a powerful way to make even the most ‘meh’ of AP flours the hydrate like they should.\n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子): Kneading and aligning the gluten into one long rope.**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) an imgur album detailing the process step-by-step. I know it looks like a lot – it’s not that bad, I promise.\n\nBasically, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again. It’s not necessarily any harder that the standard kneading motion for bread, just different.\n\nWe’re doing this because we not only want to develop the gluten network in the dough, but also *align* the gluten strands. The idea’s somewhat similar to the slap-and-fold technique in Western bread-making, albeit with a different goal in mind. The slap-and-fold gets the gluten into a sort of criss-cross pattern, while here we’re aiming for one long rope.\n\nWhen we go over Lamian below, this process becomes both insanely important and incredibly tedious. Luckily, for both Biang Biang and Chenmian, you just need to do this for ~8 minutes or until the dough gets smooth.\n\n**Technique #3: Biang-ing and Ripping the Noodle:**\n\nThis noodle gets its name from the characteristic sound it makes as it smacks the table. Far too few food names are onomatopoeias.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/94ad9z).\n\nBasically, what you’re going to be doing when pulling is first rolling it out into a ~10 inch to ~2.5 inch sheet. Then, you’ll make a small indentation in the noodle with a chopstick – this will be your ‘ripping point’. Next you grab the noodle, smack it ~10 or so times against the table while pulling gently to lengthen it out.\n\nThe way you hold the noodle while pulling/smacking is quite important, however. If you pinch the dough at all, it can end up breaking. What you want to do is lay the noodle over your four fingers, and simply using with your thumbs to hold it in place- force shouldn’t really be applied. Here’s a picture of [what your hands should look like](https://imgur.com/EeI3XDK).\n\nOnce the noodles are about arms length, rip it in half at the indentation that you made your chopstick. We usually rip one end like we did in the above video, but you could rip both ends, or you could keep it in one big ‘loop’. Up to you.\n\n**Process, Biang Biang Noodles:**\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Refer to the ‘cat claw’ technique for detailed instructions. Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick (as normal, like you usually would bread and such) to get it into a ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for more information. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular box, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then smack it into a rectangle – it’s a bit tough to describe, so I’m going to [cheat with a streamable](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a ~7x4 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here, but that’s the size that we were working with.\n\n6. *Cut the dough into four long strips.* So each strip would be roughly ~1x7 inches.\n\n7. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Remember – we usually use a few tablespoons worth of oil here for this step, so don’t be shy there. When you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate. That said, don’t go nuts - we’re not vacuum sealing.\n\n8. *Rest the dough strips for at least 3 hours and up to 8 (or overnight if need be).* We find 4 hours to be about ideal for resting. Going up to 8 is fine too – 24 hours is perfectly workable as well, but after that the dough will likely become a bit *too* soft and pull-y.\n\n9. *Remove a strip, patting slightly with a paper towel if overly oily. Roll it out into a ~2.5 to ~10 inch long sheet.* Exact size here’s nothing to obsess over, just what we find ourselves working with.\n\n10. *Biang the Noodle: Press down the middle of the noodle with a chopstick.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique for more details. The indentation in the noodle should [look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/ZHD06sW.jpg). After we slap the noodle longer, that indentation will be where we tear it open (to get an even longer noodle).\n\n11. *Biang the Noodle: Hold the noodle in your palm, lightly pressing with your thumb. Smack the noodle down against your work surface around ~ten times to lengthen the noodle.* Refer to the ‘Biang-ing the Noodle’ technique above for more details. You’re looking for [something about a meter long, like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg). \n\n12. *Biang the Noodle: In the center of the noodle, push through the groove that you made with the chopstick and pull apart the noodle to get something even… longer. We break one end of it.* Tearing apart will look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/TVUKw9o.jpg) – again, some people break both ends, and some keep the circular shape. \n\n13. *Boil for ~1 minute until it floats.* Work through your other noodles as each is boiling.\n\n---\n\n###Chenmian\n\nSo Chenmian are also referred to as Latiaozi, and – interestingly – in Xinjiang as ‘Laghman’. They’re basically going to be almost identical to our Biang Biang noodles from above, albeit in that long/round spaghetti-like shape.\n\nSo, this recipe is going to share a *lot* with the previous recipe. So I’m going to cheat and refer to the above recipe a bit. If you’re just perusing this post out of curiosity, the substantive differences are the “technique #3: pulling” and the process starting from step #6.  \n\n**Ingredients, Chenmian:**\n\nSame as the Biang Biang above.\n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\nAgain, [Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8). \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\n[Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/ajYMI2a) that imgur album detailing the process step-by-step again.\n\nRemember, you’re just kneading this stuff by repeatedly curling the dough into itself until you get one long log. Then you fold it in half, punch it down, and start curling again.\n\n**Technique #3: Pulling the Noodles**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/yznx53).\n\nOverall, the pulling technique for this noodle’s pretty self-explanatory. What you’ll do it roll it out a touch by hand (until it’s, say, ~6 inches long), then pull it. Once you can start to feel the resistance in the noodle, stop. Then continue to thin/lengthen the noodle by repeatedly smacking it against the table, ala the Biang Biang noodles.\n\nNote that there *will* be a limit as to how thin you can get the thing. What you’re looking for is something a touch thicker than fresh spaghetti, or about the same thickness as Japanese ramen. If you’re staring at a noodle that’s still a little too thick, you’ve got two options. First, you can fold the noodle in half and continue to smack in against the table. This’ll help things get a bit thinner, but you do have to be careful – it’s very easy for the noodle to break when folded. Second, you’re still working with a stubborn noodle, you can leave it there and let it rest as you work through the remainder – picking up again after five minutes or so, you can generally get it a bit thinner.\n\n**Process, Chenmian:**\n\n[Video of making Chenmian is here if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then add water by ‘cat clawing’ the mixture into the dough. Press and knead for ~1 minute into a rough ball.* Once all the moisture’s absorbed into the dough, knead it real quick to get it into a craggily ball.\n\n2. *If using AP flour instead of 00 flour, cover and let rest for ~30 minutes.* \n\n3. *Move the dough to a work surface, knead using the ‘making the abacus string technique; 8-10 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique. What you’re looking for is the dough to have a smooth surface on both sides [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP).\n\n4. *Fold the dough length-wise twice; smack it into a rectangular ‘box’, toss in a bowl and rest for ~10 minutes.* From the previous step, you will have one long ‘rope’ of abacus string. Punch it flat with your fists. Fold it in half lengthwise twice to shorten it right up. Then sort of smack it into a rectangle – [streamable is here, again](https://streamable.com/jzv81k).\n\n5. *Roll the dough out into roughly a 4x7 inch sheet.* No need to obsess over the exact measurements here.\n\n6. *Cut the sheet in half, but be sure to pay attention to which side the long side was, as that’s the direction that we’ll be cutting.* Cutting this sheet in half is actually optional, but especially if you’re just getting started out I’ll be easier to work with shorter noodles.\n\n7. *Cut into 1cm strips.* Or roughly 12 strips per half-sheet, for 24 noodles total.\n\n8. *Thoroughly oil a plate, toss on the dough strips, then oil them. Cover with plastic wrap in such a way that the plastic wrap is clinging to the strips themselves.* Don’t be shy with the oil. Also,  when you’re covering with plastic wrap, have the wrap cling to the noodles, to minimize air in the plate – something [like this](https://imgur.com/u10luQP) is perfect.\n\n9. *Rest for 3-8 hours, or up to 24.* To relax the gluten. Again, 3 hours is the minimum here, we generally like it at around the 4 hour mark. \n\n10. *Remove a noodle, slightly pat off some oil with a paper towel if needed.* Sometimes it can get a bit too oily to work with.\n\n11. *Pull the noodles.*  Pull the noodle according to technique #3 above – remember not to get too greedy re thinness!\n\n12. *Boil the noodles until a touch past al dente, ~45 seconds, then shock under running water.* \n\n---\n\n###Lamian\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enters this recipe.\n\nBefore we do anything, let me pass on you the advice one dude at my local Lanzhou Lamian shop gave *me* a number of years back when I was badgering him for tips on Lamian technique: “Give up. Do not try. You’ll never know how to make Lamian.”\n\nAt the time, I took it as a sort of ‘oh you’re just a foreigner, you’ll never understand’ kind of thing (the closest thing a white dude in China can get to a microaggression lol). Now, I understand the wisdom in his words. I wish we’d listened.\n\nThis is by far the hardest recipe we’ve ever done on our channel. It’s so tough that it makes Har Gow look like a relaxed weeknight dish. The only thing I can think of that can even come *close* to it is the proper sourdough-starter smiling Char Siu Bao, and that’s a recipe where commenters reporting failures outnumber commenters reporting successes about 10:1.\n\nSo just… stop. Turn back. It’s not worth it. Scroll right on past this, move on with your life. You’ve got the above recipes for Chenmian, right? Those are fun. You can impress all your friends with those. It’s good enough for most people – an untelling eye probably couldn’t even tell the difference.\n\nMaking Lamian, you **will** fail your first time. And probably your second. And probably many times after that. But if you keep at it… one day, things’ll click for you. And you can be content in the knowledge that you’ll be one bad-ass noodle maker.\n\n**Why is Lamian so hard?**\n\nSo like, Chenmian wasn’t too bad. Pretty much any intermediate home cook can make Biang Biang noodles. And while the thinner spaghetti-like sort might have a couple more moving pieces, in the grand scheme of things they’re not so bad, either.\n\nWhat makes Lamian *so* difficult is the introduction of alkaline.\n\nFor those of you out there that don’t live and breathe the world of Asian noodles, alkaline noodles have this *fabulous* bite to them. In the mainland this texture’s referred to as ‘tanya’ (弹牙), though perhaps you might’ve heard it called by the Taiwan term ‘QQ’. You could think of it sort of like… *al dente*. What makes alkaline noodles so beautiful is that they retain that sort of ‘al dente’ texture, even after being fully cooked. Alkaline is what makes Japanese Ramen, Japanese Ramen; it’s what makes Cantonese Wonton Noodles, Cantonese Wonton Noodles.\n\nAnd in my personal opinion, alkaline ends up being increasingly important as the noodle itself gets thinner. Super thin noodles can easily end up much too soft if you’re not careful – while I don’t think Angel Hair pasta quite deserves its bad reputation, I do believe that it would be a much better product if they added alkaline to the mix.\n\nNow, for most alkaline noodles the process isn’t all that hard. You add a bit of sodium carbonate to the dough (or a solution of sodium carbonate/potassium carbonate called Kan Sui/Jianshui), and continue along your merry way… rolling things out thin and either cutting them with a knife of a pasta maker.\n\nMaking an alkaline noodle that can *pull*? Alkaline stiffens dough! It’s like… a counter-intuitive proposition. Would almost feel like magic. And unfortunately for everyone trying to replicate this stuff outside of China? It kind of *is* magic – or at least, uses a magic ingredient. That is… Penghui.\n\n**Penghui**\n\nLet’s get something out of the way at first. Go on Amazon. Search “Penghui”. Find anything?\n\nAt least sitting here in the Spring of 2020, I can’t find jack. The only way to find Penghui is by ordering industrial quantities from Alibaba or through specialty middlemen (e.g. a place like ChinaHao).\n\nSee, penghui, traditionally, is the ash of a specific soda plant called ‘Penghuicao’, or Halogeton Arachnoidius in English. The old school way of making the stuff would be to burn the plant, then when it’s at a specific temperature to splash water in it. Apparently, it then forms a rock [like this](https://imgur.com/NBqqgYE). I’m not sure how any of that makes sense (ash + water = rock? someone help me here…), but then to use the penghui… you’d chip some of that off, mix it with water, then apply it to your noodles.\n\nNow, like the ash of many other soda plants, traditional Penghui was undeniably alkaline - probably from either potash or sodium carbonate. But besides that, it must’ve had *something* else in the mix, something that helped the noodles pull. While I can’t seem to find **any** information on the chemical composition of traditional penghui (feels like a fun thesis for any anthropology grad students out there lol), luckily for us… it actually doesn’t really matter. Because basically no one’s using that old school Penghuicao ash these days, either.\n\nWhether for economic or food safety reasons (depends on who you ask), in 1989 food science researchers from the Lanzhou University in Gansu developed a mix of additives that could be used in place of the traditional Penghui. And while it’s a matter of debate as to whether the explosion of hand pulled noodle shops in China over the last few decades is *because* of that innovation, it’s undeniably true that the spread of Lamian noodle joints and manufactured Penghui happened in tandem. Sometimes I joke that all those noodle shops around the country are really just a massive Penghui sales operation – a joke with a shred of truth to it, because if you peek back into the kitchens at Lamian shops, you’re almost guaranteed to be greeted with [the same blue bag](https://imgur.com/eurEgph) at each one.\n\nWhat’s in that blue bag? Well, I’m glad you asked. It’s:\n\n* 50% sodium chloride (salt)\n\n* 45% sodium carbonate. Can be produced at home by baking baking soda in an oven for ~1 hour at 150C.\n\n*  4% sodium triphosphate, a.k.a. STPP. An emulsifier that’s totally available in the West – actually, often it’s used in American supermarkets in order to make fish/shrimp retain more water (looks more plump, while also allowing them to sell you more water and less seafood). Here, the sodium triphosphate acts as a dough strengthener, making the dough less likely to break when you pull it. \n\n* 1% sodium metabisulfite. A reducer which is used as a preservative in winemaking, and also totally available in the West. The function here is to help relax the dough, making it easier to pull.\n\nNow, given that all of these components are available in the West, the question of whether we could just mix all this shit together naturally follows. And the answer is… kind of.\n\nIn the linked video, I try my hardest to make my own ‘homemade Penghui’ using those component parts. The problem is that we totally use about two grams of Penghui in one batch of noodles, so that means one 200 gram serving of noodles uses something like 0.02g of sodium metabisulfite and 0.08g of STPP. With those kinds of quantities, accurate **mixing** of the powders become absolutely imperative (you can’t make a solution either, as sodium metabisulfite quickly oxidizes when in contact with water). So without an industrial screw mixer, it’s really easy to, say, have some batches have a bit too much reducer… and some have not quite enough.\n\nBut does it work? Sorta. By taking every precaution I could think of making the homemade Penghui, we were able to pull it to a roughly spaghetti-thin noodle, but no thinner. \n\nI *would* recommend the homemade Penghui to experienced noodle pullers abroad as a stopgap between Penghui shipments. I *would not* recommend the homemade Penghui to a beginner. When learning, when you confront a batch of failed noodles you want to be sure that it’s your technique that’s the problem, and not your Penghui. So if you’re actually serious about learning Lamian, go on ChinaHao (or a similar website), bite the bullet and just… drop the $70 and buy too much Penghui.\n\n**Ingredients, Lamian:**\n\n1. *Pizza Flour -or- Chinese Lamian Flour, 250g.* The finely milled flour for this one is non-negotiable. Again, for standardization purposes, we used Caputo’s Chef Pizza Flour.\n\n2. *Ice Water, 120g.* So traditionally in the Northwest they use ice water in summer and tap water in the winter. The basic idea is that the ideal Lamian kneading temperature is around 28C, but shouldn’t really exceed 30. Why that is I can really find a compelling answer for, but the advice seems to ring true from experience. Of course, most of our kitchens are temperature controlled these days, so we would personally opt to use ice water all year long.\n\n3. *Salt, ½ tsp.* 2 grams. To be mixed with the ice water.\n\n4. *Any dense oil, e.g. Olive oil, ~3 tbsp.* Dense oils seem to ‘cling’ better to the dough while working it. We used Sichuan Caiziyou (virgin rapeseed oil), but olive oil also worked well in our tests. While working the dough you’re going to be **constantly** oiling your hands and the dough to make sure things don’t dry out. I’m giving an amount because it’s certainly true that some of the oil ends up in the dough itself. It’s approximate because it changed from batch to batch for us – we found that it ended up ranging between two and four tablespoons.\n\n5. *Penghui (蓬灰/拉面剂), 2g; to be mixed with 10g of water.* Again, if first starting out, I’d strongly advise biting the bullet and just figuring a way to source some Penghui. If you would like to try a homemade Penghui, this is how I did it. In a mortar, I pounded 100g of salt until powdery (super annoying), then did a quick pound of 90g of sodium carbonate, 8g STPP, and 2.5g (3/4 tsp) sodium metabisulfite. Be careful with the sodium metabisulfite – while this minuscule amount is probably ok, it would be more responsible for me to advise using PPE and/or going outside when using it. It’s not overly toxic or anything, but do not smell it as if it’s inhaled directly it can temporarily make you unable to breathe for a spell. Then I passed that through a fine mesh sieve a couple times, then mixed in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment on speed three for 30 minutes to combine. In hindsight it might have been a good idea to bake my salt first to ensure that there’s not excess moisture there. But regardless, store your mixture with food safe dessicants (i.e. those little silica gel packs that help absorb moisture). \n\n**Techniques, Lamian:**\n\nOk, so I usually like giving these ‘high level overviews’ of what’s generally going on before I dive into the weeds. But if I try to give a high level overview here, you’ll think I’m speaking a different language:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nFeels almost easy when I put it that way lol. Some of these techniques are the same as what we went over before, but (1) the abacus string method will be more involved and (2) \n\n**Technique #1: Cat Claw (猫抓手)**\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/kc56k8).\n\nSame Cat Claw technique as above, nothing overly special going on. Just hydrate that sucker. \n\n**Technique #2: Making the Abacus String (算盘子)**\n\nOk, so this is probably the most complicated move on the list – it’s similar to what we covered above, only you’ll need to be a bit more paranoid throughout the process. [Here’s](https://imgur.com/a/24vympg) the imgur album detailing it step-by-step. \n\nJust like the above noodles, the basic idea is that you’re kneading it by continuously curling the dough. You get a long log of curled dough, then flatten the sucker out, then repeat. Getting the dough flat enough to be repeatedly curled up takes a bit of technique though. While you could theoretically crack that nut however you wanted (a pasta maker is one possible – but not necessarily easier - route), the common move is to (1) punch the dough down then (2) press it flat further by crossing your hands and smushing down the edges (3) repeating the hand cross flattening with your hands crossed in the *other* direction to make things totally even and flat.\n\nThis is the most important step in the entire process. At some Lamian schools, the final test is to make an entire batch of Lamian from start to finish in less than 20 minutes flat. Of those 20 minutes, this step right here takes about 15-18 minutes. \n\nYou’ll know you’re ready to move onto the next step when it can form a smooth hole if you tear it. [I like this visual right here](https://imgur.com/mppalAF). This was a batch of Lamian dough that was *almost* ready. The hole on the right is smooth, the hole on the left is jagged. You want the hole to look like the one on the right.\n\nThis might take you a long time to do it. The saying in Lamian making is that you need to do this “9 times 9 times” (i.e. 81 times). That’s ultimately just a saying though, because the number ‘nine’ sounds a lot like ‘a long time’ in Mandarin. But we’ve counted before. We tend to need 30-40 times of repeating this process to get to the point we need. This takes us about a half hour of kneading, but it’s very normal to knead for 40 or even 50 minutes when you’re just starting out. \n\n**Technique #3: Three folds, two wraps (三叠两包): Evenly apply your Penghui**\n\nWhen we add the Penghui, we’ll mix it with water first, then apply it bit by bit into the dough. \n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/ykp6n0).\n\nBasically, when you add the Penghui, it’s pretty important that it evenly gets incorporated into the dough. You don’t want bits of your Penghui water ‘spilling’ out of the though, so the three-folds-two wraps method helps keep all that inside.\n\nDon’t feel like learning yet *another* technique? No problem. You can also just continue to use the abacus string method from before – applying the Penghui when the dough is flat. You’ll just need to be good about only adding a *bit* of Penghui to the dough at a time.\n\n**Technique #4: Combing the Gluten/Testing for Pullability (拉条顺筋)**\n\nSo, there’s two ways to do this step. [This is a clip of the classic ‘twisting’ approach](https://streamable.com/dhlc7s) done in Lamian noodle shops, but let’s just set that one aside for now. We feel like it’s easier to use the following method of gluten combing, which also helps give a nice ‘test’ of sorts for pullability.\n\n[Streamable of the technique is here](https://streamable.com/zwn5bf).\n\nBasically, what we’re doing is repeatedly pulling and folding the dough over itself, slapping it against the table between each pull. This’ll not only help strengthen the gluten network, but it’ll also help give us a ‘test of sorts’ to ensure that the dough is ready for pulling. If you can pull and fold it over itself at least five times without breaking (six is ideal), you are ready to move onto the next step.\n\nBut what if it’s not quite there? Well, now’s the point where you need to trust your hands and your instincts, and veer off-recipe. You’ll need more Penghui and more time kneading. Mix another batch of Penghui water, but maybe only add, say, a fifth of it at first. Use the abacus string method, knead it for a few more minutes. Then try to gluten comb again.\n\nNote that for this step, you need to make sure everything is super oily. Your hands, the table, your dough, everything. \n\n**Technique #5: Pulling (拉面)**\n\nOk, so I want you to get your expectations straight here.\n\nYou might have visions in your head about wildly pulling these noodles and putting on a show for everyone. You are not a Lamian master: do not try to do this. Your Lamian will become uneven and break.\n\nThis is a game of applying force evenly. It is not easy. It is entirely possible that you will do everything up to this step perfectly, but screw up here – getting some noodles that look thinner than angel hair, and some that wouldn’t be out of place in a Biang Biang.\n\nWork slowly and deliberately. If you fuck up, you fuck up – no shame there. But don’t fuck up because you were overconfident. The noodle cares not for your ego.\n\n[Streamable of the pulling is here](https://streamable.com/iii5sh).\n\nNotice that we’ll be adding some flour on the table for this step. Each time you pull, toss the center of the noodle in your little ‘flour mountain’ as you do it.\n\nYou’ll need five pulls to get to a ‘normal thin’ Lamian. That’s be about the same size as spaghetti – those can either be good in soup or stir-fried. Six pulls gets you to a ‘whisker thin’ Lamian, which’s usually what’s served in the Lanzhou beef noodle soup. Seven pulls gets you to ‘dragon beard’ thin Lamian… which’s thin enough to thread a needle, is completely insane, and way beyond our skill level. \n\n**Process, Lamian:**\n\nOk, got all that? Remember, high level overview:\n\n* Cat claw the water into the flour\n\n* Knead using the making the abacus string method\n\n* Apply the penghui by either the three-fold-two-wrap method or the abacus string method\n\n* Comb the gluten\n\n* Test for pullability\n\n* Pull\n\nAs always, [there’s a video too if you’d like a visual](https://youtu.be/6DgITQSonv4).\n\n1. *Mix the salt with the ice water, then cat claw the mixture into the dough.* Refer to the cat claw technique for details.\n\n2. *Knead everything into a ball, ~1 minute, then cover and rest for 30 minutes.* At the Lamian shops they’ll generally move straight on to the next step here, but we find that kneading’s a bit less painless with a quick rest.\n\n3. *After 30 minutes, remove the dough and roll it out into ~1.5 ft log. Thoroughly rub your hands and work surface with oil.* Again, make sure that everything is good and well oiled though this entire process. Rub your hands and work surface obsessively. \n\n4. *Punch down to flatten the dough. Then continue the making the abacus string method for ~30-40 minutes.* Refer to the ‘making the abacus string’ technique for detailed instructions. And remember: 30-40 minutes is an *estimate*. The timing will depend on your skill in doing this. It would be almost unheard of to do this in less than 15 minutes. I’d guess that it’ll take 40 minutes for a beginner. The dough will be finished once (1) small bubbles begin to form as you’re flattening it and (2) it forms a smooth hole when torn.\n\n5. *Combine the two grams of Penghui with ten grams of water.* Make sure it’s completely dissolved.\n\n6. *Flatten the dough ala the abacus string technique, then wet your hands with the Penghui water and apply it to the top of the dough. Then follow the three-folds-two-wraps technique outlined above.* Refer to the three-folds-two-wraps technique for detailed instructions. To reiterate, you can also just continue to use the abacus string technique here if you prefer – simply add the Penghui a bit more conservatively.\n\n7. *Fold the dough in half, roll it into about a foot and a half log, then liberally apply oil to your dough, hands, and table.* A well oiled situation is important for the gluten combing.\n\n8. *Comb your gluten.* Refer to the gluten combing technique for more information. If you can fold the dough over itself 5-6 times without breaking, you are ready to move onto the next step. If you can’t, go back to step five but add only a fifth of the Penghui water, and knead using the abacus string method for another ~5 minutes. Loop through these until you’re at the correct consistency.\n\n9. *Flour your work surface, pull the noodles.* Pull according to the pulling technique outlined in technique #5 above. Remember, work slowly and deliberately. We'd recommend five pulls for fried noodles, six pulls for soup noodles. Tear off the very end of the dough – that bit’ll be garbage, unless you got a better idea.\n\n10. *Immediately toss in some boiling water to cook.* Until just past al dente, ~45 seconds. If not eating immediately, you can flour them up… but try to devour sooner or later.",

        "body": "##How to use these noodles\n\n---\n\nOk, so great. You’ve got some noodles. How to actually make use of them?\n\nWhile I’m probably blanking on some stuff, there’s three basic ‘categories’ of dishes you can make with these guys: (1) soup noodles (2) mixed noodles and (3) fried noodles. You can make pretty much any these three things with any of these three noodles (with the possible exception of fried Biang Biang noodles… but then again I’ve heard Xi’an Famous Food’s famed Cumin Lamb Biang Biang is actually fried?)\n\nSo because I’m starting to run out of breath here, I’ll choose one dish from each ‘category’ so you can at least get an idea.\n\n###Soup Noodle: Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup:\n\nIf I were a better recipe writer, I’d follow up the Lamian recipe with an equally long and involved recipe for the beef soup that’s traditionally eaten with it. And listen, it’s a good soup.  But after all the blood, sweat, and tears of testing La Mian, we… didn’t feel like researching and testing the soup.\n\nSo I’m going to cheat, I guess. [Here’s a recipe for Lanzhou Beef Soup, courtesy of the blog ChinaSichuanFood](https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/lanzhou-beef-noodle-soup/). Elaine’s stuff’s excellent as a rule of thumb, and in her recipe she was… smarter than us and just used packaged Lamian haha (not the same thing, but… is 100x the pain worth 3x the deliciousness?). While we might have some of our own opinions here or there (e.g. the chili oil used up in the Northwest is usually made with a milder chili closely related to Kashmiri), her recipe is great and the broad strokes of it would also be how we’d approach it.\n\nIf you’d like, you can also use Elaine’s recipe for the soup together with the Chenmian. While the very best Lanzhou beef soups would probably opt for something thinner than the chenmian (i.e. the six-pull Lamian), it would still be very delicious.\n\n###Mixed Noodle: Youpomian (油泼面)\n\nFor Chenmian or Lamian, (if served unfried or without soup) it’s probably most common to see them with a saucy stir fry topping called *gaizhaomian*. One example would be something [like this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Uyghur_Lagman.jpg). We have no recipes for that kind of thing off the top of my head (apologies), but could give you an educated guess if you were curious and pressed us.\n\nFor Biang Biang, probably the most classic 'mixed' topping is a chili oil based sort called Youpo Mian. But   there’s *tons* of other toppings use for Biang Biang, some of which I covered in a separate [Biang Biang noodle topping post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/dmwmvz/recipes_how_to_top_a_northwest_chinese_biang/). For the sake of brevity though, let’s just cover the chili oil one.\n\n**Ingredients, Chili Oil Topping:**\n\n1. *Leek (大葱), ~3 inch section.* Minced.\n\n2. *Garlic, 2 large cloves.* Minced.\n\n3. *Chili flakes (辣椒粉), 4 tsp.* In the Northwest, they actually use a slightly milder chili for their chili oil. It’s closely related to Kashmiri chili, so making some chili flakes out of kashmiri chilis would have a pretty authentic flavor to it. That said, we used the bog standard Chinese chili flake, and you could also use the red pepper flakes y’all get in the West. Korean chilis might also be a solid direction here.\n\n4. *Sichuan peppercorn powder (花椒面), ½ tsp, optional.* You could go either way for this one.\n\n5. *Light soy sauce (生抽), 4 tbsp.*\n\n6. *Dark Chinese vinegar (陈醋/香醋), 1 tbsp.* If you’re rolling through this recipe and this is the only thing you can’t source… eh… hmm… I dunno, use half cider vinegar and half balsamic. I just made that substitution up on the top of my head though so please don’t hold me to that. Or maybe just buy some, it’s a good ingredient. \n\n7. *Salt, ¼ tsp.*\n\n8. *Peanut oil (花生油), 5 tbsp.* To be heated up and poured over the chili flakes/garlic. A sizable quantity of oil’s important here to keep things slippery.\n\n9. *Baby bok choy (上海青), ½ or 1, quartered.* Optional, use whatever blanched green or vegetable you want. Bean sprouts are also hyper common.\n\n**Process, Chili oil topping:**\n\n1. *Mince up the leek and the garlic.*\n\n2. *While you’re cooking the noodles, toss the quartered bok choy in with it to blanch. Blanch for 45 seconds.*\n\n3. *Nestle the vegetable in and put all the non-liquid toppings over the noodles. Spoon the soy sauce and the vinegar around the sides.*\n\n4. *Heat the oil up until it’s just starting to smoke, ~215C, then pour it over the noodles, aiming for the chili and the garlic.*\n\n###Fried Noodle: Chaolamian (炒拉面)\n\nThis fried noodle can be made with both Chenmian and Lamian (I doubt Biang Biang would work, but hey – if you wanna be experimental). There’s many types of fried pulled noodles of course – this is a classic version that you can find at noodle shops with a tomato/chili bean paste base.\n\n**Ingredients, Chaolamian:**\n\nFor this specific recipe, we opted to use egg as the protein, but that’s basically just because we had some on hand. You could alternatively use lamb, marinated beef… or really whatever.\n\n1.\t*Noodles, 300g.* Chenmian or Lamian are both great. If you want to give this one a whirl without making hand pulled noodles from scratch, feel free to try this with… whatever noodle you feel like. Japanese Ramen (the proper sort, not Top Ramen), Sichuan alkaline noodles, longevity noodles, etc etc. \n\n2.\t*Eggs, 2.* To be beaten and scrambled. Or, your protein of choice.\n\n3.\t*Garlic, 3 cloves.* Crushed.\n\n4.\t*Tomato paste (番茄酱), ½ tbsp.* A real thing in Northwest cooking, I swear.\n\n5.\t*Sichuan Chili Bean Paste (红油郫县豆瓣酱), ½ tbsp.* Something I’ve learned recently – most chili bean pastes that I’ve worked with here in China are actually a sub-category of chili bean paste called ‘chili bean paste in red oil’. No wonder some people’ve had problems with chili bean paste-based recipes. *Sigh.* You’re looking for the sort that comes in a big red plastic jar, [like this](https://www.amazon.com/Sichuan-Pixian-Boad-Paste-Chili/dp/B01M31VHNZ). It’s also available (super overpriced) online.\n\n6.\t*Baby bok choy (上海青), 100g.* Sliced horizontally. Or, your veg of choice.\n\n7.\t*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.* For seasoning/use while stir-frying.\n\n8.\t*Seasoning: ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp five spice powder (五香粉), ½ tbsp of dark Chinese vinegar (香醋/陈醋).* One of the few stir-fries that we’ll season with five spice powder directly. For the dark Chinese vinegar, there’s two big varieties in China – Chinkiang (镇江香醋) and Shanxi Mature Vinegar (山西陈醋). Both are ok here, though Shanxi Mature would be slightly preferred (we used Chinkiang). If working with Western vinegars, our suggestion would be subbing it with a ratio of 2:2:1 balsalmic:white vinegar:water.\n\n9.\t*Other vegetables for the stir-fry: Red onion (洋葱), ¼ quarter; Green mild chili (青椒), ½; Red mild chili (红椒).*  All sliced. For if you don’t feel like grabbing different color chilis you can also just use solely green or red mild chilis. Anaheims are perfect, poblanos would be a little spicy but still work. Bell pepper would also be acceptable. Red onion is for looks, yellow onion is also totally cool.\n\n10.\t*Toasted sesame oil (麻油), 1 tsp.* For finishing.\n\nYou’ll also need ~2-3 tbsp of oil for cooking the egg, followed by ~3tbsp of oil for stir-frying.\n\n**Process, Chaolamian:**\n\n[Video of the frying of the noodles is here](https://youtu.be/qzAdiOhaZJs?t=243) if you’d like a visual to follow along.\n\n1.\t*Crush the garlic, slice the onion and chilis into slivers, chop the baby bok choy, beat the eggs.* For the baby bok choy, cut slice the bit that ‘holds it together’ at the end, then chop into ~1 inch sections across the stem. For the eggs, really beat the snot out of them until no stray strands of egg white remain.\n\n2.\t*Scramble the egg.* However you want, I guess. But if you want to follow us, first *Longyau*: get your wok piping hot, shut off the heat, add in your oil (here about 2-3 tbsp) and give it a swirl to get a nice nonstick surface. Swap the flame to medium, then heat the oil up until it’s bubbling around a pair of chopsticks. Pour in the egg, let it puff, then pull the cooked portions to the sides of the wok, letting the uncooked bits set in the center. Then once it’s ~80% not runny… flip it. Shut off the heat, quick scramble, and reserve.\n\n3.\t*Boil the noodles.* Boil the noodles as per the recipes above, or whatever sort of package you’re working with.\n\n4.\t*Stir fry the noodles.* As always, first longyau. Piping hot wok, flame off, ~3tbsp of oil, swirl. Flame on medium then, immediately:\n\n* Garlic, in. Fry for ~30 seconds til fragrant. Scooch the garlic up the sides of the wok.\n\n* Shut off the heat. Add the tomato paste and chili bean paste. Swap flame back to low. The reason we shut off the heat before adding the pastes is because those guys love to burn. \n\n* Fry for ~2 minutes until the pastes have stained the oil obviously red. Up the flame to medium.\n\n* Baby bok choy, in. ~30 second fry until slight wilted.\n\n* Noodles, in. ~30 second fry until it’s all basically mixed.\n\n* Swirl the tablespoon of soy sauce over your spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Salt and five spice powder, in. Super brief fry.\n\n* Onion/peppers in. Quick ~15 second fry.\n\n* Add back in the egg. Super brief fry.\n\n* Swirl the half tablespoon of dark Chinese vinegar over the spatula and around the sides of the wok. Super brief fry.\n\n* Heat off, drizzle the toasted sesame oil. Another mix, then out.",

        "body": "##Quick note to fellow Lamian geeks re dough conditioners:\n\n---\n\nForgive me for getting into the weeds for a second here, and definitely skip this if you don't live-and-breathe noodles and such. See, there’s been a subset of us Lamian nerds online that’ve been arguing about how best to make pulled noodles outside of China for, like, the better part of a decade. I’m feeling a little lazy to bump the ol’ eGullet thread though, so forgive me for chiming in my two cents here.\n\nRecently, I’ve seen a lot of hype surrounding adding either L-cysteine or nutritional yeast to the mix in order to get a pullable noodle. The former seems to be from reports that certain noodle shops in southern Japan use it as a conditioner, the latter from Tim Chin’s recent (very cool) [SeriousEats article on the topic of Lamian](https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/04/homemade-hand-pulled-noodles-lamian.html).\n\nI do have my doubts that either of these two additives alone could make a pullable alkaline noodle – Tim’s SE recipe specifically states that it (i.e. the deactivated yeast) can’t. I certainly understand the desire to make a Lamian recipe that doesn’t call for minuscule quantities of weird shit like Sodium Metabisulfite – on that note, I think Tim’s deactivated yeast is bloody brilliant. But it *is* still missing something, of course, else it’d also be able to pull with the addition of Kan Sui.\n\nThe thing that I think these reducer-focused recipes are missing is the emulsifier. On a whim once we tried applying solely salt plus a sprinkle of sodium metabisulfite to the dough, just to see what would happen. Adding *that* much reducer undeniably turns the dough into puddy, but after a pull or two the noodle **still broke**. The effect is a little hard to describe, but it feels like the dough loses its integrity… like a Chenmian that’s been sitting in the back of your fridge for a week. You need a *stronger* noodle – and that’s where the emulsifier comes in.\n\nEmulsifiers function as dough strengtheners. How exactly they differ from oxidizing agents, and why they don’t seem to sacrifice extensibility are both good questions that are beyond my pay grade. There’s a pretty good 2019 article on the subject of STPP in noodles called “The effects of phosphate salts on the pasting, mixing and noodle-making performance of wheat flour”, [link here](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.01.049). Adding STPP, particularly between the levels of 0.05% and 0.1% (note: we were at 0.04%), caused “an enhanced resistance to successive mixing and an improved capacity to sustain shear force”. I could certainly be misreading the paper (I uh… majored in Finance lol), so definitely don’t take my word for it, but the fact remains that the emulsifier seems to be an important component.\n\nBecause you know that classic blue bag of Penghui? These days it’s not the only name in the game. There’s another mix from a company called QBR that’s relatively popular and also works like a charm. Their mix? 42% sodium chloride, 35% sodium carbonate, 8% potassium carbonate, and 15% acetylated distarch phosphate. \n\nWhat’s acetylated distarch phosphate? …an emulsifier. Why are they bonding phosphate to a modified starch instead of using a phosphate salt like STPP? No clue. But notice, **there ain’t a single reducer in that mix**.\n\nBecause really, relaxing a dough’s easy. As evidenced by Chenmian… all you need is time, really. Keeping an alkaline dough from breaking after multiple pulls? *That’s* the ballgame.\n\nIn the future, I hope someone can come up with a similarly brilliant solution to the emulsifier problem as Tim did for the reducer. I do wonder if lecithin (potentially in combination with the nutritional yeast) might do the trick – if it does, people could potentially bake some baking soda to get some sodium carbonate, then everything needed for Penghui could be available at supermarkets in the West. Purely speculation though.\n\n##Lamian: What to do if you fail\n\n---\n\nOh no! You failed your Lamian. C'est la guerre. You hungry? It’s ok. You can still eat dinner.\n\nIf you have a pasta maker… fold the dough a couple times then pass it through, I dunno, the third smallest setting. Then cut it using the 2mm setting. Now boil.\n\nIf you don’t have a pasta maker, roll the dough out thin, then fold it a few times until the whole thing is roughly the size of your knife. Then cut it into ~2mm strips. Now boil.\n\nWe ate a *lot* of failed test batches. They’re still pretty tasty noodles to be honest. It’s not ideal because these failed batches end of breaking kind of easy when boiling, so sometimes you can have these weird ~5-6 inch long noodles. They won’t impress anyone, but hungry people definitely won’t complain.\n\nNot hungry? Just want to practice a bit more? Press your failed noodle together, then apply a bit of penghui to the dough, starting from step five. The additional Penghui will bring the dough to life – often Lamian shops’ll keep some dough in the fridge, then add some additional Penghui, and start with the gluten combing step when people order a bowl of noodles. You can use this trick to practice repeatedly with one batch – that way, you can work on your skills repeatedly without wasting ~an hour of your life each time. At some point, the Penghui’ll get too much and you’ll need to toss the dough, but hey, these components are pretty cheap anyhow.",

        "body": "Thanks for in creating this informative essay! The hard work also showed in your videos and it inspired me to try an experiment (though much smaller scale than yours!) in seeing how freezing might affect the dough. So after making some lamian based on your video (the non-alkaline one), I put some of the pre-pulled dough and some pulled noodles (mainly used pulled ends off noodles to reduce waste) into the freezer to see how if it would work. \n\nThe pulled noodles cook well from frozen and although not perfect, are still pretty decent, having a nice \"chewyness\" to them. I found that if you cook a pulled noodle from frozen it had higher chance to snap in half in the hot water, however if you let it defrost a little first until more soft, then it stayed long. \n\nFor the pre-pulled dough, the outer edge had a dried skin, however to my surprise i was able to somewhat pull out the noodle, although had to be super delicate and ended up with an irregular thickness. Picture here (https://imgur.com/a/Kp2sAZP). The noodle cooked well and tasted fine as well. It kept its shape after coming out of the hot water and withstood a quick stirfry. \n\nSo in summary, it is possible to freeze the dough pre-pulled, however not a particularly uniform or long noodle. Freezing the noodles after they have been pulled and then cooking after leaving to defrost for short period of time is probably best approach if you had to freeze.",

Over the years have seen more and more westerners contributing to the English speaking elth of knowledge whereas most of the resources when I had first begun were in Chinese. I have only successfully pulled beautiful noodles once and it was such a surprise. Since then I've become very good at kneading but still have yet to replicate those thin noodles. I have to go to work and this is a huge post so I haven't finished reading, but I'll add some preliminary thoughts so excuse me if anything I mention is already in the post. \n\nI did not use any alkali in the one success story, so I'm convinced it's not 100% essential. However salt is absolutely necessary. This paper, [effects of salt on gluten formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0733521014000769) shows that salt can strengthen the gluten bonds but only to a limit, before it becomes a hindrance. From memory there is also a paper on the effect of alkali substances but I forget where. \n\nI have also learnt that, (without an alkali solution at least) your dough will take a significantly longer time to knead before being pullable when using high gluten flour. I agree that 00 flour is a good alternative to any specific noodle flour but you should also be conscious about protein content. Low protein flour may be easier to knead (good for practice!) but I'm not 100% sure if it's possible for consistent results. Again, my one success story was with ~10.6% protein I believe.\n\nOften times, any lamian failures have been turned into biang biang noodles which are so much easier, but less rewarding haha\n\nI'll add anything I remember to this post later, and will continue reading this post throughout the day but thanks to everyone who wishes to spread the joy of hand pulled noodles.",

        "body": "Making your own 蓬灰 by evenly blending a mix of these solid chemicals certainly sounds challenging. The ratio of the different quantities is really too skewed to do so successfully with just household tools.\n\nThe standard answer would be that you should first make aqueous solutions and then manipulate those. Both salt (NaCl) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) have a pretty long shelf life even when in solution. The biggest challenge would be that right after you made Na2CO3 from baking soda, you most likely (?) had the anhydrous chemical, whereas if you let it sit it might have turned into the monohydrate. So, you cold run into difficulties measuring precise quantities. No idea how important it is to hit exactly 45%.\n\nSo, I'd suggest making fresh Na2CO3 and then immediately mixing it with salt. You can then either store it dry. In that case, the salt would help a little bit to minimize the amount of error you introduce by allowing the Na2CO3 to slowly hydrate. Or alternatively, you could store it in solution. That way, the ratios won't change any more. And from what I can tell, in a clean bottle, a solution of NaCl and Na2CO3 should be shelf stable for a couple of years.\n\nSTPP is more challenging. If exposed to acids, it'll react quite rapidly. But even in an akaline aqueous solution, it can degrade within a couple of days; this seems more likely, if you don't manage to keep the bottle sterile, as there are different ways that it can biodegrade. In other words, STPP solution should be prepared right when needed, and you otherwise store STPP as a solid. In solid form, it has a long shelf life.\n\nSodium metabisulfite is even more problematic that way. It is pretty shelf stable when stored in a clean dry containers. But in solution, it'll react with all sorts of things. Don't expect a long shelf life from an aqueous solution. This chemical definitely should be stored dry and used within a couple of hours of dissolving it in water.\n\nMeasuring quantities of less than a gram is very difficult to do with common household equipment. But fortunately, both STPP and sodium metabisulfite should be relatively cheap. So, we could measure out something on the order of one to ten grams (much easier to do), and then dilute with water to the desired percentages. Then it is relatively easy to measure a small number of milliliters of this solution and to discard the bulk of the solution. At home, a syringe from the pharmacy is probably the best tool to measure out the amounts that are needed.\n\nThat way, we get precise measurements. It is still possible to mess this up, as mixing a large quantity of liquid is not *quite* as easy as mixing a cup of coffee. But that's a relatively easy problem to solve. Just keep stirring longer. Overall evenly mixing liquids is much easier than blending solids.\n\nOh, and instead of grinding your own salt, buy unflavored popcorn salt. That saves you one tedious step.\n\nI haven't bothered doing the math to come up with a reproducible set of instructions yet. But I feel that with some care, mixing solutions of the chemicals would be the best approach to make penghui at home in the US. Having said that, I still hope to find a way to source the ready-made known-good powder. Much less messy. And the rest of the noodle recipe is already complicated enough; no need to add even more complexity.",

Nouilles Fraiches in Paris is where its at for those who are curious, but I've heard Tran Tran Zai is the shit too but have not been there yet.\n\nAnyway, that last step of pulling the dough carefuly and ending with an ever thinner and longer strand of noodle ? After reading your post and realizing how hard all of this is I'm amazed by the fact that the noodle makers in these restaurants slap the shit out of their dough and throw it around like it's nothing. You got a couple of guys just slamming order of noodles after order of noodles. Crazy to watch.",

But I don't want to come across as unreasonably greedy, even if I am sure I can ultimately figure out a way to send them the money.\n\nAlso, in our case, this would most likely be a request that would need to be filled in Taiwan. Any sense whether this is an ingredient that could be found in a normal super market? Or is it only available from specialty restaurant supply stores?\n\nToo bad the COVID-19 makes it unlikely there'll be any travel back-and-forth in the near future. So, instead of bringing it in person, it probably would need to get mailed. That'll take forever and will be needlessly expensive.\n\nNonetheless, thanks for the excellent instructions.

Because if so, I can't imagine you are able to do anything else with your time other than research!! (To be fair, sitting in the back of a Lamian shop watching the chefs intently and taking notes sounds like a fun Saturday to me :D )\n\nI live in Japan so I have access to awesome fresh ramen, and a slightly thicker variant called Okinawa Soba. My go-to 15 minute healthy-ish dinner these days is ramen topped with a vegetable+egg stir fry, and then loaded with all the usual suspects for topping dry noodles: soy sauce, black vinegar (I could DRINK that stuff..) , zha chai/pickle of choice, blanched greens, chopped scallions/chinese chives, chilli oil/sesame oil, MSG, etc. It's fun to experiment with these! \n\nFor the eggy veg topping, I've noticed that in your videos and others, egg stir fries in China tend to be very much based around cooking the egg 'well done' - it's basically scrambled and very much fully cooked, whereas I like them super runny: I basically stir fry aromatics with green veggies super quickly and then add beaten eggs right at the end, mix and pour onto the noodles - they only have a few seconds of heat in the pan so they're still super runny and I love the way they mix into the noodles and other toppings. \n\nI wonder if you know of any recipes in China where runny eggs actually do appear? Here in Japan they're everywhere, raw too is super common. (Tamago Kake Gohan, Natto+Egg, Oyakodon, etc..) If there's some kind of cultural difference, I wonder if food safety may be part of the reason why? \n\nThanks again for the AMAZING recipes and video man, truly doing gods work.",

They talked about it thusly:\n\n> The city of Lanchow, located in the Kansu Province, has a secret liquid called \"lye water.\"  Adding a few drops of this to noodle dough will make the noodles contract and become very firm. Lye water is made by boiling crushed bits of Lanchow rocks, and only using the top of the mixture. The rocks come from the Gobi desert, where weeds are cooked in holes to become charcoal. The charcoal is then frozen to harden it. The result is a man-made rock.  \n(Note: Lye water is also known as caustic soda. You *can* use it to cook, but be careful! It is highly corrosive with a pH level of 13 [strong alkali]).\n\nHope this proves to be interesting for people :)",

I'm using the sector emergency broadcast system. Greenies of the 17th Special Tasks Combat Team have managed to get it up and running.\n\n\"There are things you need to know. These ten tips may help you make it to tomorrow.\n\n\"First of all: You are not alone. There are other survivors out there.\n\n\"Second: Listen for the sound of howling. The sound *will* keep the shades away. Even if nobody is there any more, it is a safe place.\n\n\"Third: Turn off and/or destroy any and all viewscreens encountered. This will slow down their ability to move around and slow down their spread.\n\n\"Fourth: Spraypaint the date and your initials on easily visible surfaces such as walls in order to let others know that you were alive on that date. Put words of encouragement to your fellow survivors on walls and floors.\n\n\"Fifth: BobCo Emergency Survival menu is accessible on all nanoforges. Even nanoforges that are disconnected from GalNet and SolNet. Iron and sodium chloride infused cans of spraypaint are on menu A-871. These can be used to spray walls to prevent shades from moving through. Additionally, mylar sheeting can by used with tinfoil on the windows and strips of tinfoil hung from the ceiling will prevent shade incursions.\n\n\"Sixth: There are rumors of prayers to the Digital Omnimessiah being answered. Do not lose faith. Reports of light emanating from beings praying to the Digital Omnimessiah have come in across the affected zone. Shades cannot enter that light. Futhermore, prepubescent females of known species singing hymns to the Digital Omnimessiah while wearing blindfolds appears to hold off phasic shades within hearing distanced of the hymns.\n\n\"Seventh: Steel may work in a pinch, but pure iron works best. Iron oxide, rust, can be thrown out and will disrupt them as well as can be used as wall coating when mixed with paint or glue.\n\n\"Eighth: News from Confed sources state that salt AKA NaCl AKA Sodium Chloride creates a barrier to the shades. Mixed lightly, 10:1 to 20:1, with iron oxide and the barrier causes damage to the shades. Salt can be used to close barriers as well as create circles of protection.\n\n\"Ninth: The shades are more active at night but paradoxically enough they are at heightened activity during times of full lunar visibility at night, as if the light of the orbital body strengthens them. They are not as strong but are still deadly in absolute darkness and can be easily seen.\n\n\"Tenth: The shades mostly linger around the site of their last kill or near places reminiscent of places important to them in life. Know their grouping areas, paint warnings to others. Shades, when quasi-dormant, repeat the same actions over and over in some kind of loop. Loopers do not react to the appearance of the living unless their loop is disturbed.\n\n\"And lastly:  This event is survivable. You can survive. You can stay alive. Do not lose hope.\n\n\"If you can hear this, stay alive. That's my message to you. Stay. Alive.\n\n\"Use text. Stay informed. Stay alive.\n\n\"Ave Imperator.\"  - Recorded Broadcast from the front Lines of Iron Piglet; Journalist unknown (Presumed Killed in Action, remains unrecovered, file header damaged)\n\nCaptain Tut'el ducked underneath one of the enraged Terran's swings, the lineart and shading passing over his head without even disturbing the air. He thrust out with the tire iron, poking the Terran in the stomach.\n\nThe Terran gave an enraged scream and puffed into nothingness.\n\nEctoplasm splattered him as Major Vuxten ripped through two shades with one swipe, turned, and chopped twice at one attempting to move through the car to get at the driver, who was moving around the car with a can of spraypaint in one hand and a bottle of narcobrew in the other.\n\nAll three shrieked and vanished.\n\nThe driver, Beatnik or something like that, finished off the narcobrew he was holding and whipped the bottle at one of the phasic shades. It didn't really do anything but make it flinch, but it gave the driver time enough to draw his pistol and fire twice.\n\nThe iron bullets popped the shade and the driver holstered the pistol, reached back into the vehicle, grabbed a beer, knocked the cap off, and took a long drink with one smooth, practiced motion. The private went back to quickly and sloppily spraypainting the car with something he'd pulled out of the trunk.\n\nPart of Captain Tut'el wanted to be outraged about how the driver was drinking in uniform, probably drinking on duty, another part of him felt like he should just give it up, that all was lost, that there would be no way to punish the private so why bother getting angry.\n\nTut'el held onto the part about the private drinking.\n\nTwo more shades rushed Tut'el. *He was a disgrace to the uniform* the first one Tut'el snarled at and smashed its hands away with the tire iron. *The private was a disgrace to the Corps*, Tut'el stepped forward, stabbing with the pointed end, feeling resistance. *a disgrace to Telkan everywhere* Tut'el pushed harder and the shade shrieked and dissolved.\n\nAnother shade swooped in out of the dark, hands outstretched, and Tut'el stepped to the side and swung the tire iron in a move that would have broken a living person's arms. *Drinking on duty,*  the arms sprayed out line-art and the hands and forearms dissolved as the shade screamed. *probably carousing* Tut'el swung again, this time hitting the shade across the back of the head *and stealing government property* the shade exploded into whitish dust even as another pair rushed Tut'el *and defacing the barracks murals* the tire iron swept through the lower abdomen of one of the shades and it puffed out of existence *and putting the forks in with the spoons in the messhall!*\n\nThe tire iron felt like it hit resistance this time when Captain Tut'el swung it with both hands, hitting one of the shades in the torso. *How dare he drink on duty like common street trash!* Tut'el hauled back the tire iron and hit the shade again, this time in the face.\n\n*The Private probably even doesn't have his card with AR-670-1 printed on it in his pocket like he is supposed to!*\n\nEctoplasm splattered him.\n\n*He probably doesn't even have ear plug case on his person much less on the first belt loop to the right of the trouser enclosure!*\n\nAnother shade lunged out of the shadows and Tut'el spun and swung the tire iron.\n\n*Why, he probably even has inter-species pornography in his room!*\n\nThe tire iron hit the shade in the shoulder, ripped through with a spray of ectoplasm, and the shade screamed with the voice of the damned as it dissolved.\n\nTut'el glanced over and saw that the Private was spraying the front of the staff car with something from the spraycan that still gleamed wetly. The Private threw the can to the side, ducked under a phasic shade swinging at him, and fired twice, the iron bullets popping holes in the shade but not stopping it.\n\n*He's probably wearing winter socks even though it's summer!*\n\nTut'el stepped forward, stabbing the shade from behind. The Private nodded tightly and climbed over the hood, up onto the roof of the car, and dropped inside through the ring-mount.\n\nThe chainsaw roared and an arc of ectoplasm sprayed out.\n\n\"Get in!\" the Private snapped, the engine on the car roaring to life. \"Not the doors, car's sprayed!\"\n\nTut'el scrambled onto the hood, feeling the weird tacky feeling of not-quite-dry instant drying paint. He dove into the ringmount, landing on his side, and wiggled away from the seat.\n\nThe Warfather dropped in, feet first, crouched, and slammed the ringmount hatch.\n\nThe driver, Beatnik or whatever, lit a Treana'ad smoke and looked at the Warfather.\n\n\"Where to, sir?\" the Private asked.\n\nThe Warfather reached down and picked up a narcobrew, using the dash to pop the cap off, and took a long drink. He wiped his mouth as he put the bottlecap in his top pocket.\n\n\"Gotta rally the troops,\" Vuxten said.\n\n\"What about your armor?\" Beatnik asked.\n\nVuxten touched his implant. \"471, how's the armor?\" he paused for a second. \"What do you mean it's demanding I name it? Fine, give me a minute...\"\n\n\"Troubles at home, sir?\" the driver asked, hitting the headlights. The lights looked weird to Tut'el. The shades actually flinched back from the yellowish light.\n\n\"What did you do to the headlights?\" Vuxten asked.\n\n\"Sodium lights,\" Beatnik said. \"Cut the wires to the headlights, put in a sodium-chloride solvated connector,\" the private shrugged. \"Ran it off the cracked nanoforge in the trunk,\" He handed back a spray can. \"Use this, sir, on your clothing.\"\n\nSpraying his clothing with one hand, Vuxten put his fingers on his temple. \"471, sodium lights, use sodium chloride solvate terminal connectors, whatever that is!\" the Warfather looked at the Private. \"Where did you get that idea?\"\n\n\"Big Mike's Terran horror movie night, sir,\" the Private said. He jerked the wheel, catching a shade with the fender and ectoplasm sprayed across the hood and the windshield. \"Used iron/sodium-chloride infused CARC crimson-880808 finisher coat spray-paint.\"\n\n\"Did you hear that, 471?\" the Warfather asked. He nodded and repeated it. \"Terran horror movies. Yeah, more of them are probably true than we want to know. No, I haven't figured out a name. Wait, tell her her name is Aki'mi'hehrt, after my sister.\"\n\nTut'el watched as the driver slammed the car into a pack of shades, tensing, almost sure that they'd just sweep through the body of the car and through all of them, snuffing out their life-force as they passed through the living.\n\nInstead, they shattered into ectoplasm.\n\nTut'el startled himself by accepting the Treana'ad smoke from the driver, taking a deep hit off of it, and handing it back even as he coughed and hacked from the harsh smoke.\n\n\"Paint's on the floor. Spray your shirt and pants,\" the driver said.\n\nTut'el nodded and picked up the can of spray, shaking it, and starting to spray himself. \"Anger and rage help,\" he coughed.\n\n\"Does at that, sir,\" the private said. He slammed on the brakes, sliding to the side. \"Tell 'em to come in through the mount. Use the spotlight on them.\"\n\nAs he took the hand held spot from the private, Tut'el heard the thumping of shades shattering on the vehicle's surface.\n\nTut'el stood up, yanking back the ringmount panel and poking his head up. He triggered the spotlight and shined it around.\n\nA half dozen troops were all gathered together, twice their number laying dead on the ground, shielding their eyes from the harsh bright yellow light.\n\n\"In through the mount, troops!\" Captain Tut'el yelled, then ducked down.\n\nOne by one the troops dropped in, most of them moving into the back. The last one reached up and slammed the ringmount hatch shut as the vehicle lurched into motion.\n\n\"Here, spray this all over yourself,\" the Warfather said, holding out the can of spray. \"Just close your eyes or you'll end up blind.\" He put his hand on the door again, closing his eyes, reciting something under his breath.\n\n\"What is it?\" one of the troops asked.\n\n\"Your mom's ass blast,\" the driver said.\n\n\"Nicky! 'Sup?\" one of the troopers said, pushing forward between the seats.\n\nTut'el noted that they had the spray all over their face and clothing. A glance showed tendrils of electricity moving along Vuxten's arm, onto his fingers, and dancing across the door.\n\nThe air inside the vehicle reeked of spraypaint to the point where Tut'el reached forward and hit the NBCRN system to clear the air.\n\n\"Got shades in the road!\" the driver called out.\n\nThe vehicle hit with the weird spongey feeling of having driven into a cascade of falling water. Ectoplasm splashed the windshield hard and Beatnik hit the wipers instead of the static discharge cleaning system.\n\n*So it doesn't get rid of the paint,* Tut'el thought to himself.\n\n\"Motorpool coming up!\" the driver yelled. Tut'el looked up to see small drones spraying something on the ground outside the motorpool. \"When I stop, unass the vehicle!\"\n\nThe driver, Bet.nik, no, Bit.nek, slammed the brakes, yanking on the wheel, sending the heavy vehicle sliding toward the gate. Tut'el saw at least two drones arc away even as another bounced off the window.\n\n\"DISMOUNT DISMOUNT DISMOUNT!\" Bit.nek yelled.\n\nThe six troops unassed the vehicle. Tut'el went to get out and Vuxten grabbed his shoulder, pulling him back.\n\n\"Not us,\" Vuxten said.\n\nA green mantid, wearing red painted armor, swooped out of the darkness, wings extended and microjet turbine hissing. It swooped in and landed on the Warfather's lap.\n\nVuxten slammed the door. \"Hit it.\"\n\n\"Where we going, sir?\" Bit.nek asked, slamming the accelerator, the engine roaring. He swerved out into the road as the mantid climbed over the back seats and into the back where Tut'el had reasoned out a cracked nanoforge was hidden.\n\n\"City is sixteen miles away,\" Vuxten said. He looked over the back. \"Fab us up body armor with cold iron and sodium-chloride layers and coating. Make sure it's 880808 coloration.\"\n\n\\--oh specops forge nice-- came from the back.\n\nThe Private had already grabbed the ebrake, yanking on it, and pulling the armored vehicle in a tight 180, dropping the ebrake and slamming the accelerator to send the vehicle hurtling down the road.\n\n\"We're going to get to the emergency broadcast system,\" the Warfather said. He held up his stubber and checked the telltales. He lowered it.\n\n\"Can't stop the signal, Mal.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wyrjkj/first_contact_chapter_832_book_of_the_dead/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x4jvjw/first_contact_chapter_834_book_of_the_dead/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

        "body": "Salt is another tricky one.  Humans have been using it maybe even longer than iron.  Sodium and chlorine, a tale as old as time of mismatched opposites that are strong together.  Salt was the ultimate cleaner, the ultimate purifier.  Food packed in salt could last months or even years longer that food left in the open.  It became a cornerstone of human culture; salt cleans and protects.  It kept away disease, it kept away decay, and that belief of fourteen thousand years of terrans made a strong impression on their psychic beliefs, and their shades.\r  \n\r  \nIt isn’t all superstition; there’s science too.  Sodium is incredibly reactive, and if you don’t believe me just ask a glass of water.  It bonds spontaneously with almost anything and will rip molecules apart to do it.  And yet terrans have it in their blood to make their supercharged nervous system work properly.  Chlorine is a corrosive devil that they know almost as well; Their alchemists (note: An alchemist Age of Ideas scholar practicing in the study of prenanotech magic) mixed chlorine with almost everything to try to unlock the forces of creation.  Chlorine was what they used to dissolve anything they needed to study.  \r  \n\r  \nSo you have ultimate purity mixed with ultimate destruction in a clear/white crystal that humans love to eat.  The primal forces of chemistry, barely contained by a simple ionic bond.  And for fifteen THOUSAND years they’ve believed it was pure.  Mined it, boiled it, eaten it, fought wars over it.  Salt built nations and toppled empires.  Salt kept death at bay and sustained them when nothing else could.  Salt even bends WATER to its will and gives us that lower freezing point that keeps the mix smooth and creamy.  Why does salt work on shades?  Because even in death the shades remember there’s one thing that can’t be corrupted.  \r  \n\r  \nThey remember.  And they respect it.  \r  \n\r  \n\\-Seamus Kik’nik’ilitik, Treana’d exobioconfectioner, 2nd Lieutenant in 56th Horde Kitchen Division.  -Memoirs of the 3rd Phasic War-",

The declaration of CASE OMAHA/CONDITION SAMEDI just gave him the Need to Know perk, and attached it to his existing clearance level... which you know he has managed to unofficially officially upgrade at least one or two levels higher than anything that's actually acknowledged in paperwork anywhere.\n\nWhich basically means he now has complete and unfettered access to all the things ever used to bump back at things that go bump in the night.\n\nHe just needs to 1) realize this, and 2) show us the power of this fully operational logistics demigod in getting the things that are needed into the hands that need them.",

Before, it would have been quick and easy, but the Atrekna had attacked the system, perhaps recognizing its strategic importance to the former Council areas. The resulting fighting, both from the frantic defense and the Confederate counter-attack, had damaged almost everything.\n\nSurprisingly, the space port had survived mostly intact.\n\nThe huge interstellar liner had docked at the station, entering the system even though it was still hosting combat between isolated Atrekna space units and the Confederacy. The shuttles, all five of them, carrying nearly a hundred passengers each, had swooped down, escorted by Confederate aerospace fighters, and landed at the spaceports landing field.\n\nThe passengers had left the shuttles, moving into the concourse and waiting to be questioned regarding their reasons to arrive in a war torn system and arrive at a war torn planet.\n\nDana'ahsh was a Hashenesh. Before the Big C3 he had worked in a factory checking people's ID's as they entered the factory for their workday. Once that was over, he had started working at the starport. For the last few years he had slowly moved his way up through the job ranking. He had taken classes and the like to learn to do different jobs.\n\nNow, he worked in the incoming passenger/tourist/traveler section. He checked ID's, visas, and other forms of identification against lists.\n\nWhen the Atrekna attacked and the sun went red, he'd still showed up for work. When the Confederacy had counter-attacked, he'd showed up for work.\n\nHe was in the middle of working, the sun having set outside the huge macroplas windows, checking IDs and asking the proper questions, when it all came apart.\n\nDana'ahsh had already been on edge.\n\nTwo of the passengers were slightly shifty looking to the Hashenesh.\n\nOne was a boxy robot with treads and a head that was mostly made up of lenses, with skinny arms with graspers. It was covered with scraped paint, although there was a pink 'heart' with some odd characters around it on one side.\n\nThe other was the one that really made Dana'ahsh worry.\n\nThe other was dressed in odd clothing. Denim pants, heavy leather boots, a hat pulled low over the eyes, denim jacket lined with wool, a gunbelt with a heavy magac pistol on it. The person leaned against the wall, smoking Treana'ad smoke sticks and pulling bottles of fizzybrews out of their pocket.\n\nWorse, the person was some kind of Terran Descent Human labeled as an \"Earthling\", which made his panel light up with all kinds of warnings.\n\nHis supervisor, a lazy being, had just hit the override and gone back to playing a ranked ladder game of \"Hearts of Warsteel\" warfare simulator. Dana'ahsh understood his supervisor's reluctance to leave the game. There were sash ornaments and achievement trophies to be won.\n\nDana'ahsh himself had been knocked out of the \"Sins of a Stellar Empire\" ladder ranked match a week ago.\n\nThe line was moving slowly, a lot of people giving the Earthling odd looks, keeping track of them out of the corner of one eye.\n\nThe Earthling seemed to ooze malevolence and danger even though they did nothing but smoke Treana'ad smoke sticks and drink fizzybrew they pulled from their pocket. They even handed the bottles and extinquished smokesticks to the robot, which cracked open its forward chest panel, dropped the item inside, and vibrated, making grinding noises, for a few seconds before giving a whistle and a thumbs up.\n\nFinally, the Earthling moved in front of Dana'ahsh.\n\n\"Name?\" Dana'ahsh asked, feeling anxious even as the surface of his counter lit up, showing an outline of a hand.\n\n\"Blue Herod-38442,\" the Earthling stated, putting his hand on the outline.\n\nThe system had already been overwritten so no sirens went off but the whole counter still flashed red.\n\n**\\*\\*WARNING EARTHLING WARNING\\*\\***\n\n**\\*\\*PSYCHIC WARNING\\*\\***\n\nThe being sighed.\n\nTwo weapons appeared on Dana'ahsh's monitor. The \"earthling\" had a 10mm magac pistol strapped to his hip on a leather belt, a knife hidden in the right boot as well as having a knife in a spring loaded holster strapped to his forearm.\n\nThe little robot was listed as unarmed, just having a Class-IV grinder and a Class-V creation engine.\n\n\"Yeah,\" the Earthling said.\n\nThe hat was listed as having a psychic suppression device worked into the headband.\n\nDana'ahsh decided to not ask the Earthling to remove the hat.\n\n\"Reason for visit?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"I'm checking the records for the sector GalNet and ansible traffic,\" Blue Herod stated.\n\nDana'ahsh frowned. \"You can't do that virtually?\"\n\nBlue Herod shook his head. \"The data might be altered. I need to check the source.\"\n\nDana'ahsh just shrugged. \"All right. Length of stay?\"\n\n\"A week at the most. If I don't find what I want by then, I'll have to look elsewhere. She'll know I'm here and adjust it accordingly,\" Herod stated.\n\n\"Anything to declare?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Pistol, three knives,\" Herod stated.\n\nDana'ahsh frowned. \"I only see two.\"\n\n\"One in the belt buckle,\" Herod said, slapping the belt.\n\n\"I see,\" Dana'ahsh stated. \"Anything...\"\n\nDana'ahsh was looking at the Earthling so he saw it directly.\n\nThe 2.5D monitors behind the Earthling suddenly flickered. Drawing of Terrans, white line-art, suddenly appeared in the images. Swooping in from the edges or standing up from the bottom. All of them were screaming.\n\nDana'ahsh saw a man, his face scored by white lines of bleeding gashes, *reach out* of the 2.5D monitor, slapping his hand on the painted ferrocrete wall, and pull himself out of the image. Other Terrans were pulling themselves free.\n\nThey were made of white lines, translucent in the spaces between the lines. They flickered and moved jerkily, spasticly.\n\n\"By Daxin's beard!\" Dana'ahsh swore, jerking back even as he slapped the emergency button.\n\n\"Daxin didn't have a beard. He's clean shaven,\" Herod said, his voice sounding tired.\n\nFour shades swept into the crowd, all of them descending on an unlucky Carikan. They touched the flightless avian, who screamed briefly and collapsed as the shades ripped something bluish out of him.\n\nHerod turned slowly, one hand dropping to his waist as Dana'ahsh ducked behind the counter. People began screaming and Dana'ahsh could hear them panicking, stampeding away.\n\n\"Phasic shades? Here?\" Herod said, his voice sounding only vaguely interested. \"Yup. Guess it's more likely than I thought.\"\n\nDana'ahsh peeked back over the counter even as the screaming got louder.\n\nHis eyes visible beneath the brim of the hat as burning red lights, Herod was moving away from the counter, a weird movement where his legs crossed one another right to left even as he pushed the side of his denim jacket back.\n\nMore shades were pulling free of the 2.5D monitors that covered entire walls.\n\nThe crowd was in complete panic. The shades were attacking the edges, grabbing blue energy out of the bodies, which crumpled. The shades near the shade holding the blue energy would shriek in rage and attack the shade with the blue energy.\n\nThere were dozens of fights, all near bodies that had collapsed, unmoving, on the floor.\n\nOne swept toward Blue Herod and Dana'ahsh expected the Earthling to fall down dead as soon as he was touched, just like every other being.\n\nInstead Blue Herod held out his left hand, hand cocked back at the wrist, fingers straight. Blue Herod put the palm of his hand against the forehead of the screaming male shade, even as his right hand dropped down to his waist, pulling the heavy magac pistol free, bending his arm at the elbow and firing two shots from the waist.\n\nThe shade stopped dead, somehow held back by Herod's hand. Clear fluid exploded from the back in two gouts as the weapon exploded loudly.\n\nDana'ahsh saw Herod turned and begin firing at the viewscreens. Sparks showered out from the screens as they imploded. Plas shards and internals exploded outward as the rounds fired by the pistol exploded in the walls.\n\nFour shades swooped toward Herod who ducked underneath the swiping clawed hands, firing his pistol even as he pivoted on the heel of one boot. Four shots rang out, even though Dana'ahsh knew magac pistols should have been nearly silent except for the round going hypersonic. Smoke erupted from the pistol and Dana'ahsh saw flame erupt from the end of the barrel.\n\nAll four shades exploded into clear fluid that splattered around them even as Blue Herod did something with his fingers and open a cylinder that dropped from the side of the magac pistol. He pulled something out of his pocket, pushing something in and tossing something else over his shoulder even as he gave the pistol a snapping motion that caused the cylinder to close.\n\nBlue Herod said something to the robot, which gave a double-thumbs up and started vibrating.\n\nBlue Herod pivoted, firing at the ones attacking each other, the crowd, and ripping blue energy out of fallen or screaming victims. Silver streaks connected the end of the pistol to the shades, which exploded into steaming clear goo.\n\nHands over his sensitive ears, unaware he was making reflexive barking sounds as he gulped in air and triggered his barking sack, Dana'ahsh just stared as Blue Herod reloaded the cylinder and fired again.\n\nThe little boxy robot opened the panel in the front of the boxy body, reaching in and pulling out another gunbelt.\n\nHerod grabbed it with one hand, throwing one end out. The belt somehow reached full extension then whipped around Herod's waist, until the end slapped Herod's belly. Herod hooked the buckle over the loose end.\n\nThen drew another pistol.\n\n\"HIT THE EMERGENCY SIRENS!\" Herod yelled, glancing once at Dana'ahsh.\n\nDana'ahsh realized that Herod's eyes were ice blue.\n\nDana'ahsh triggered the general alarm even as Herod kept shooting. Dana'ahsh had no idea how Herod was reloading the pistols when he had a pistol in each hand, but after six shots the Earthling was forced to reload the pistol in a strange smooth motion that never released the other pistol.\n\nOne of the things that Herod was discarding landed on the counter in front of Dana'ahsh and the counter flickered. A disk with a button on one side and six holes on the other. The counter circled it and ID'd it: \"speedloader\".\n\nA shade lifted up through the floor, reaching for Dana'ahsh and he flinched backwards, scrambling away.\n\nThe Earthling took a step and kicked the shade in the face, sending it howling away.\n\nBefore it got ten feet the Earthling shot it in the back of the head and it erupted in a spray of ectoplasm.\n\nThe little robot beeped and the Earthling looked at it.\n\n\"How bad?\" the Earthling asked.\n\nThe robot beeped some more as the Earthling reached out and helped Dana'ahsh to his feet.\n\n\"Do you have a car?\" Herod asked Dana'ahsh.\n\nDana'ahsh nodded. The robot held out some kind of long gun and Herod grabbed it, throwing the carrying strap over his head so the long gun was across his back.\n\n\"Do you know where the ansible is?\" Herod asked.\n\nAgain, Dana'ahsh nodded.\n\n\"Lead the way to your car, I'll cover you,\" the Earthling said.\n\n\"Wha... what's happening?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Shades are loose in the system. They're moving through GalNet and SolNet,\" Herod said. \"We've got to get to the ansible.\"\n\n\"It's almost fifty miles,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nThe Earthling fired twice more, killing a Shade running for a female Hikken that was screaming as she ran for the exit.\n\nHerod sighed. \"I can't believe I'm about to say this,\" he muttered.\n\nBefore Dana'ahsh could asked what Herod grabbed Dana'ahsh's shoulder.\n\n\"Come with me if you want to live,\" Blue Herod said.\n\nDana'ahsh just nodded frantically. \"OK, OK,\" he said. He dug in his pocket, pulling out his keychain and the keychip for his car. \"I'm out front.\"\n\n\"We'll have to run,\" Herod said. He frowned again. \"Are the lights adjustable?\"\n\nDana'ahsh nodded.\n\n\"Bring up the lighting controls,\" Herod said.\n\nA shade rushed out of the wall and Herod held his hand out, stepping forward, stopping its forward momentum with his palm. The shade screeched and reached up, wrapping its hands around Herod's forearm even as Herod smoothly drew the pistol.\n\nThe Earthling shot the shade point blank in the face and holstered the pistol before the goo stopped spraying across the floor.\n\nWorking quickly, Dana'ahsh brought up the controls, even as the robot kept beeping and holding out other things. Another long gun, two bandoleers of bullets, and a pauldron that Herod pulled on and then attached a light to.\n\n\"Use the color code 880808,\" Herod ordered. \"All the lights, across the whole building. Parking lot if you can,\" Herod said.\n\nDana'ahsh nodded, adjusting it.\n\nIt was red.\n\nHis favorite color.\n\n\"Hey, that's the same color as my car,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nHerod looked at him, the Earthling's hands still pushing thick bullets into the long gun. \"Our lucky day, then,\" he looked around as the lights went red. \"Let's go.\"\n\nThere was enraged screaming from all around, coming from the walls, the wiring, the air ducts.\n\nDana'ahsh swallowed thickly as he went with the Earthling, heading for the parking lot.\n\nDana'ahsh cringed inside as they passed body after body.\n\n\"Why are they dead?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Shades yank your soul out,\" Herod said. \"Technically, they disrupt and remove the bioelectric field of living organisms, feeding off of it. Realistically? They yank out and bite big chunks out of your soul.\"\n\n\"That sounds terrible,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nThe Earthling gave a grim chuckle. \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\n\"It didn't do it to you. I saw you touch one, saw one grab you. Why not?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling shrugged, which Dana'ahsh knew signified that the Earthling didn't know. \"Probably because I'm an Earthling and a few other things.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Dana'ahsh said. He looked around, the walls a lurid crimson. \"Why aren't they attacking us?\"\n\n\"They don't like the color red,\" Herod said. \"It interferes with the wavelength they travel on.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"They don't like metallized mylar either,\" Herod shrugged.\n\n\"You know a lot about them,\" Dana'ahsh said, stopping and letting the escalator move him down to the ground floor.\n\n\"Dealt with them for a few centuries,\" Herod said. He looked down at the robot, which was holding onto his leg as it was canted perilously on two of the escalator steps. \"Think we can fab up the phasic strobing system?\"\n\nThe robot gave a couple of beeps and then a sad sounding noise.\n\n\"Yeah. Planet's different than a Dyson sphere,\" Herod said. He sighed. \"Have to figure out something else.\"\n\nDana'ahsh hurried to the door that led to the parking structure. He peeked out the door and saw that the lights were red, but there was a lot of shadows and dark areas that he could see white forms flickering and jerkily moving around.\n\n\"There's a lot in there,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nHerod nodded. \"There always is,\" he said. He pulled around one of the long guns and nodded. \"Open the door, let's head for your car.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Dana'ahsh held up his keychain. He clicked the buttons.\n\nA red car lit up as the lights came on and the electrical systems went live.\n\n\"Electric car?\" Herod asked.\n\nDana'ahsh nodded.\n\n\"Crap,\" Herod said. \"Make sure your radio, your dash cams, your viewscreens, all of it is shut down.\"\n\nDana'ahsh frowned but brought up the holographic menu and followed the instructions.\n\n\"All right, let's go,\" Herod said.\n\nDana'ahsh hurried out, unlocking the car as he ran.\n\nTwice shades tried to sweep into the red light, reaching for Dana'ahsh and twice that long gun went off with a loud explosion and a gout of flame from the end. Each time the shade exploded into a shower of clear goo and dimples appeared in the glass and macroplas on the other side of the shade from Herod.\n\nHerod pulled open the door and lifted the robot up, putting it in the back seat, then moved around the car as Dana'ahsh opened the door and got in.\n\nThe screen on the dash flickered and Herod smashed it with one fist as he got in.\n\n\"I won't know how fast I'm going or if someone is behind me,\" Dana'ahsh said. \"I won't get traffic alerts.\"\n\n\"You also won't get a shade climbing out of it and ripping our guts out in the car,\" Herod answered.\n\n\"Oh,\" Dana'ahsh said. He pulled out.\n\n\"Go fast. Don't worry about speed limits,\" Herod said, rolling down the window.\n\n\"Why not?\" Dana'ahsh asked as he went up the ramp that would lead to the freeway that would take them to the city.\n\n\"That's why,\" Herod said.\n\nThe city beyond was on fire. Smoke rising up from the skyrakers, skyscrapers, and buildings. Explosions blew out windows as entire floors of high rise buildings were destroyed. Grav-vehicles tumbled from the sky or moved back and forth.\n\nDana'ahsh could hear the screaming.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x4jvjw/first_contact_chapter_834_book_of_the_dead/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x7fjxt/first_contact_chapter_83x_book_of_the_dead_random/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

Eelgeet pointed behind him. He threw the runner to the ground. \"Fight or die.\"\n\nEegleet turned and looked at the Gal-Net primary planetary access port.\n\nNormally it was unassailable. A digital fortress full of 'authorized people have keys' mentality.\n\nEegleet was one of the few who had ever hacked his way into the site.\n\nNow, he was leading an assault on it while every net runner, script kiddy and kitty, every corp net-slave, every single person who could type on a keyboard and figure out how to upload a picture social media that had volunteered were running the guns.\n\nGuns taken from video games and jazzed up with attack programs. Well, more like the guns from video games and popular media were overlaid across attack programs and a little bit of data slicing and cross wiring allowed video game skills to translate over.\n\n*Not like it requires precision*, Eegleet thought to himself, staring at the primary access port.\n\nThe shades were flooding out, screaming into the datalines in thick mobs that the massed guns blew into pixels that often reformed.\n\nThe shades had pushed forward, out of the trenches of the signal hold buffer, and were slowly moving across the file allocation request tables.\n\nThere was a ping in his ear and Eegleet AKA Crashrider put one hand against the side of his head.\n\n\"Crash here,\" he said, even as he walked over toward a set of Lanaktallan matrons who were running a heavy machinegun from the wreckage of their favorite recipe forum.\n\n\"It is I, Darmo'o,\" the voice said. There was silence for a moment. \"I have a job for you.\"\n\nEegleet felt everything go tingly. Darmo'o had been his boss for nearly two years after rescuing him from the clutches of the Executor Council.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" he said, feeling Crashrider surge up to the surface.\n\n\"Four targets. The Confederate ansible, the Council needlecast system, the Confederate needlecast system, and lastly, the hypercome wave system. Blow them. Either disable their ability to send/receive or make them physically destruct. Either way is preferable,\" the Lanaktallan business magnate slash software developer said. His voice was deadly serious.\n\nCrashrider looked at the ansible's fortress walls. They were tattered and heavily damaged from the battle to hold the shades back.\n\n\"Got it,\" he said. \"Are you safe?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" Darmo'o said, his voice tight. \"Shut those down or the shades will just keep coming. It's the only way to stop them.\"\n\n\"It'll cut us off from the rest of the galaxy. You'll go bankrupt if you aren't sued to oblivion,\" Crashrider said.\n\n\"I don't care,\" Darmo'o said. \"Just do it.\"\n\n\"Will do,\" he paused. \"It was a pleasure.\"\n\n\"And an honor,\" Darmo'o said and cut the line.\n\nCrashrider pinged his software, looking up who of his chummers were still around. He highlighted the nearest one and punched in the admin codes he's stolen a year ago and hoarded like they were made of gold and he was a dragon. He *jumped* next to Renegade Dime, the other runner kneeling down and setting charges to blow the data-lines, crash the routers hard enough they'd have to be physically reset.\n\n\"Dime,\" Crashrider said.\n\nThe avatar looked up.\n\n\"Got a job,\" Crashrider said. He looked out at the shades. \"Maybe the last run.\"\n\nRenegade Dime stood up, rolling his shoulders. \"Runner's only as good and only as famous as his last run,\" he said, deliberately misrepresenting the saying.\n\nCrash nodded, pointing over at the one way dataline, which manifested in the eVR as a eight lane overpass. \"Meet me there.\"\n\n\"Yeesa yeesa, bossman,\" Dime said. He looked down, punched in some numbers. \"Big bomba here, boss.\"\n\nCrashrider nodded and *jumped* again, appearing next to Cyberplushie, the big netrunner merc kneeling next to a pair of Lanaktallan matrons, instructing them on how to use the heavy crew served machinegun.\n\nCyberplushie nodded, patted the two Lanaktallan on the hip, and moved over to Crashrider.\n\n\"They should be fine,\" she said.\n\n\"Gotsa jobsa. Lastiddly diddly joberino, maybe,\" Crashrider said. He pointed at the ansible. \"First strike point,\" he pointed off into the distance in the neon black sky. \"Needlepoints, second strike points,\" he pointed at what looked like pounding surf. \"Last target.\"\n\nCyberplushie looked at the hypercom wave carrier signal. \"Might not come back from that, boss,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Gotta stop the signal,\" Crashrider said. He gave a wry chuckle. \"After all the times we yelled you can't stop the signal, it falls on us to stop it.\"\n\nPlushie nodded. \"I'm in.\"\n\n\"Meet there. Dime's there,\" Crashrider said. He shook her hand, passing her a temp admin power to teleport across the map.\n\nPlushie nodded, flickered and vanished.\n\nCrashrider *jumped* again. This time he appeared next to Steeltalon.\n\n\"Talon,\" Crashrider said.\n\nSteeltalon looked up from where she was applying a trojan-worm to a severed leg.\n\n\"Last job?\" Talon asked.\n\nCrashrider nodded.\n\nSteeltalon looked down, made sure her patient was stable, and stood up.\n\n\"I'm with you,\" she said. She took his hand. \"I'm ready.\"\n\nCrashrider nodded.\n\nThey *jumped*.\n\n\\-----\n\n\"Smash all the screens. Smash anything that can project a hologram,\" the large Hesstlan male bellowed out.\n\nSome of the Hesstlan screamed and drew back from the sheer aggression in the male's voice, others screamed at the fact that he picked up a chair and used it to smash the hologram projector for the daily menu as he spoke.\n\n\"STOP SCREAMING!\" a female yelled. Her eartips weren't dyed or powdered, like the current fashion, but instead she had piercings with long chains and tiny bangles. She had been holding the big male's hand as everyone had ran.\n\nThe other female, that had been holding the male's other hand before he had grabbed the chair, ran forward, running *toward* the eVI that was down on her knees, screaming, raking her face with her own nails, digital blood sleeting down her face. The short female grabbed a queue pole and swung it overhead, slamming it down on the holoprojector.\n\nIt shattered and the eVI vanished.\n\n\"Salt, iron, and rage, got it,\" the big male said, talking to someone on his comlink. \"No video, make sure nobody is using their picture in picture, got it,\" the big male ran over to the snack bar, grabbing two salt shakers and running back. \"MOVE!\" He lowered a shoulder and plowed into the crowd, knocking down or aside anyone who didn't move out his way.\n\n\"Is everyone OK?\" the male asked, stopping at the doorway. He yanked the top off one salt dispenser with his teeth and dumped it in a line across the doorway. He began pushing and shoving his way toward the other door.\n\nThe smaller girl was smashing holoprojectors. She picked up a celery flake shaker and threw it hard enough to shatter the screen of the 2.5D LCD display.\n\n\"HELP HER!\" the bigger female yelled. She grabbed a young Hesstlan woman who was staring and screaming, pulling back her arm and slapping the other woman hard enough her residual claws left behind three furrows in the fur with reddened flesh. \"SMASH THE SCREENS!\"\n\nSome were moving, flinching back, often with a screen as an eVI or VI hologram appeared.\n\nMost of them were howling in agony, screaming in insanity.\n\nThe big male grabbed the female with out-of-style bangles in her ears. \"Find the nutriforges, punch in the emergency code, and Bree's saying to fab up iron powder in pepper shakers.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"We've got one under the counter at the coffee stand I work at.\"\n\nThe big male rubbed the side of his face, where he had only three whiskers instead of four, against the side of the big females. \"I love you,\" he whispered, a phrase that only a few years ago he could have never foreseen saying to someone outside his family.\n\n\"Copy that,\" the female said, a slight smile on her face as she pulled back and ran for the coffee stand that she worked at some evenings. \"WIMMY! HELP ME!\"\n\nThe smaller female, her jewelry more subdued, the chains shorter, fewer bangles, turned from where she was beating a 3D display's projectors to death.\n\n\"Finish it,\" the short female snapped, tossing the queue post to a male and running over to the big female.\n\nThe one who caught the pole, who was wearing stylish powder on her ears and cheeks, dipped her ears in submission despite the fact the other Hesstla female was smaller than her, then gripped the pole tightly, turning and smashing at the holoprojectors with the queue post.\n\nAnother male, this one from the gymnastics team, called out the big male's name.\n\n\"ELU!\" he yelled out. \"HEAD'S UP!\"\n\nThe big male looked up and saw the heavy duty salt shaker flying through the air, spinning slowly, salt misting out of the perforated end.\n\nElu caught it with one hand, dropping the empty shaker, and went back to pouring salt across the floor in a thick line.\n\n\"Stay safe, Bree,\" Elu said. \"I love you.\"\n\nElu suddenly seemed to focus more as two other males shouldered their way through the screaming crowd, which had huddled up in the middle of the dining area, bigger females on the outside, the smaller males in the middle, with the smaller females between the larger females and the males. In the center of the huddle were three females, all of them with swollen bellies.\n\nSeeing that behavior Elu knew that his fellow students and the few teachers he could see mixed in had fallen back on primal instinct in their horror driven panic.\n\nHe was grateful that two of his team-mates were still thinking.\n\n\"What do we do?\" one asked.\n\n\"My sister said...\" Elu started.\n\n\"She's the nun?\" Arleetru asked.\n\n\"The one from the docu-vid?\" the other asked.\n\nElu nodded. \"She said iron hurts them, if you flick salt at them they'll flinch. They can't cross salt barriers and they can't move through red with the color code 880808,\" Elu said. \"She said Mylar with a one point five micron layer of aluminum oxide is something else they won't move through.\"\n\nBoth his team-mates nodded.\n\n\"Steel doesn't work. Once it's steel, it's useless. Iron only. If you can find the entry on the 'forge for 'cold iron' that's preferable,\" Elu finished.\n\n\"Got it. Cold iron and salt,\" Ortrupa said.\n\n\"Grab someone to watch your back. Be careful. Get to a forge, they're all in emergency services mode, fab up a cold iron bar to swing, then salt,\" Elu pointed at the huddled up group. \"Put a circle around the Primary Fluffle, then start on bottom of the doors, then windows, then walls.\"\n\nThe other two nodded and quickly moved away.\n\nElu closed his eyes, just for a second, still pouring the salt along the big bay windows.\n\nHe was glad that his sister had fought in the War In Heaven.\n\nAnd he felt guilty for that.\n\nHe opened his eyes, shaking the salt dispenser slightly.\n\n*I can feel guilty later, right now, I need to survive.*\n\n\\-----\n\nThe system shuddered as the Hellspace portal tore open and a spacecraft the size of a small city erupted from the burning lake. Its lines spoke of mathematical brutality, of precise cruelty, and of carefully computed dominance. Its hull was scarred here and there from battle, silently attesting that this craft wouldn't make the computational mistakes of its newer brethren. Its hellcore driven engines glowed sullenly even as the targeting systems came up, lashing at everything near the massive craft with enough power to blister paint. Heavy nCv cannons oriented, missile bays opened their huge doors, and sensor dishes scanned and oriented.\n\nHowever, the scream of \"You Belong to Us!\" or \"There Is Only Enough For One\" was not what howled through the system even as the Hellspace portal collapsed in an orb  of flame that quickly went out.\n\n**HEY-O FUCK-O'S!** sounded out across the system.\n\nStill, the beings at traffic control, the ones that were still alive, felt their hearts quail at the appearance of the PAWM.\n\nFor most of the beings in the system, the cryptic bellow was just one more bite of the huge shit sandwich everyone had been forced to sit down and partake in.\n\nCommunications were down to nothing more than text and voice, and even voice could be a bit risky if, for some reason, the voice channel used enough bandwidth. Most beings in the system didn't know what was going on five blocks away, much less what the massive Precursor Autonomous War Machine was doing.\n\nThe few who could track it, watching icons on a screen that were little better than text, simple triangles, circles, x's, and crosses with numbers attached rather than the complex visuals of only a few hours before, saw it turn and accellerate toward the Oort Cloud even as it fired at the inhabited planets.\n\nThey knew their data was minutes or hours old, but seeing the massive and probably ancient ship fire on the planets made all of those watching wail in dismay.\n\nInstead of the nCv and missile launches hitting the planet, they struck at the orbital links for the ansibles, the hypercom, and the needlecast. The PAWM fire was precise, without the collateral damage that those witnessing it had seen from the PAWM so many times before.\n\nThose watching the instruments saw the big PAWM being firing into the Oort Cloud.\n\nAlarms wailed as the ansible system, the hypercom wave generators, and the needlecast transmitters started taking hits. Their point defense overwhelmed, their shields failing.\n\nThen one by one destroyed.\n\nThose in the system braced themselves.\n\nThey doubted that the PAWM knew that the inhabitants of the stellar system couldn't have used the superluminal communication links.\n\nPlanetary Defense and System Defense braced themselves.\n\nThe PAWM's reasoning was clear.\n\nEliminate the communications links, prevent the system from calling for reinforcements or assistance.\n\nThe PAWM was massive, it's lines spoke of experience and cruelty, its demonstrated firepower was overwhelming and precise.\n\nThe Planetary Defense knew that soon they would not only be fighting the shades, but PAWM ground forces.\n\nThe System Defense braced themselves. They had not upgraded their defenses, all they had was Council equipment.\n\nWorse, the only ships were those that had been powered down. The others were overrun with the terrible Terran shades that had crawled out of any visual screen they could, clawing their way out of the superluminal communications links.\n\nThe defenders would have to shoot by eye, use 2D screen systems with crude icons only.\n\nThe PAWM would sweep them aside like trash no matter how valiantly they attempted to defend the system.\n\nThose who could, watched, holding their breaths, as the PAWM reoriented. It transmitted a single message, using Unified Galactic Standard Text Encoding.\n\n**SODIUM CHLORIDE FOR GROUND BARRIERS IRON FOR DEFENSE 880808 COLOR FOR SURFACE BARRIER** the PAWM roared out instead of the standard battlecry.\n\nNothing followed as the PAWM aimed its hull further into what had been Council Space.\n\n**SO LONG FUCK-O's!** rang out across the system.\n\nThe PAWM tore open a portal and lunged through it.\n\nIt was gone.\n\nNot that those in the system could take a breath of relief.\n\nTrue, no more shades were swarming into the system.\n\nBut they still had to fight to survive.\n\nNow, however, they had a chance.\n\n\\-----\n\nEMERGENCY CHAT ROOM OPENED\n\nBINARY SIGNAL ENCODING ONLY\n\n<IN THIS DARK HOUR BE ONE ANOTHER'S LIGHT>\n\nMANTID has logged on (We must endure)\n\nTREANA'AD has logged on (Pet a moomoo, you'll feel better)\n\nRIGELLIAN has logged on (We sing in the dark)\n\nKOBOLD has logged on (Fellstrik Time)\n\nTERRASOL <carrier wave not found>\n\nTERRANS <not found>\n\nBASS has logged on (We're not a fish)\n\nDASS has logged on (The digital is real now)\n\nCYBORG has logged on (Metal and meat)\n\nCLONES has logged on (We are the same yet different)\n\nNEW USERS FOUND\n\nOPENING CHANNELS\n\nThere are multiple new users waiting for codex and authorization.\n\nProceed?

Once editing is done book seven will go out. Cover's done, so... yay! I need to get three editors to edit book one, two, and three. It won't be a high paying gig, but it'll pay.\n\nI miss writing every day and can't wait to go back to it in October. Vacation will probably be at home, since we ran into some unexpected expenses this week. That's OK, though, because we'll make it. :-)\n\nNow, for your weekend safety briefing!\n\nIt's Friday, which means another weekend. Don't drink and drive. Don't beat your significant other unless both of you are into that. Don't beat your spouse, your girl/boy/xirfriend, your kids, your parents, or your pets. Don't pet the midget, she bites. That guy in the metal T-shirt has probably never heard one of their songs on the radio. A hot tub is not an impulse buy. Don't buy, sell, transport, manufacture, or use illegal drugs. Don't play \"Fuck the Police\" when you're getting pulled over by the police. Don't do anything dangerous that you don't want to be made fun of for.\n\nOn that, take care of yourself. Life isn't easy and death comes for us all. Keep your head up even when someone or something tries to hold it down.\n\nLove yourself, love other people, smile at yourself in the mirror, close your eyes and give yourself a hug. Touch a friend on the shoulder.\n\nLive, my friends. Just live.\n\nRemember to take time for yourself, even if it's just a couple of minutes or a few seconds.\n\nRemember, before you do something you regret, go somewhere, ball your fists, clench your toes, close your eyes, and slowly count to ten. That might help.\n\nJust care for yourself, and when you can, for someone else.\n\nI guess, with that, it's rattle the tin cup time.\n\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/RaltsBloodthorne  \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/First_Contact  \nFirst_ContactBooks: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYK5F88  \nBEHOLD HUMANITY! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H5ZZL93",

It came to pass upon the Glassing.\"  \nHumanity was gone after that, the Terrans running around were the ontological inertia of TerraSol made manifest.  \nThe answer to the Atrekna, the Mantid, the Devourers, the Skanetti, to everyone who ever puffed their chest up and demanded of the Universe, \"yeah? And what are you gonna do about it?\" was always \"well, I have this one neat toy\", but when the Mantid struck Terra, the humans died out and Terran Descent emerged with limiters and restrictors and all sorts of safety protocols to keep them from being human.  \nWhy?  \nBecause even in rage so deep their only desire was xenocide, the humans still wanted to be friends.  \nSo they shackled themselves with weights, they blinded themselves, they stripped away the things that made them the most dangerous things in all of the Malevolent Universe's Chortling Glory.  \nBut what limped on was a child, a small candle flame to arrest the descent into madness and hatred that would wash blood across the universe in an unending wave. A small candle flame with only a little candle left.  \nAnd waiting, hiding in the shadows, not Earthlings who are crippled brothers, siblings to the true parent, the Old Man that the Digital Omnimessiah wore as a memoriam: Humanity, waiting in darkness, crouching, preparing.  \nThe Atrekna's strike didn't destroy humanity. It partially killed off one of humanity's children, and then the shackles they welded around their own wrists tore them down.  \nAnd now, all that remains is a clock. Tick-tocking, one little click at a time towards zero.  \n\"Now I lay thee down to sleep. Goodnight daddy, goodnight mommy. Goodbye. I love you.\" - the Terran gestalt, signing off at last.   \nEveryone forgets, though. That clock is still ticking down and it counts not the human descendants who walk the overstretched skin of reality, no  \nIt is the time lock waiting to zero out so shackles can be broken and Humanity can once more be beheld by all who would seek to strike at them.  \n\"That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeon even death may die.\"\n\n\\--Prydonian the eye of the storm\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA friend of mine posted this on the discord and wasnt going to post it here.",

Meaning unknown.\n\nTut'el stared at what, who, stomped out of the darkness, partway into the room, then stopped.\n\n\"Come in much further, we're going to fall through the floor,\" the massive armor said, using an external speaker.\n\nThe Warfather shrugged. \"Not my intention.\"\n\n\"You got phasic shades everywhere,\" the figure, who Tut'el knew could only be Enraged Phillip, said slowly. The armored human lifted a hand and pointed a thumb behind him. \"They're all over the parking lot.\"\n\n\"I need to shut down the ansible links,\" Vuxten said.\n\nThe human skull faced helmet turned left and right. \"We can do that,\" the Terran said. There was silence for a second. \"Menhit wants to know if you've eaten today.\"\n\nThere was an awkward silence broken only by the far off shrieks of enraged phasic shades.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Warfather said.\n\n\"All right, let's get to work,\" Enraged Phillip said.\n\nTut'el tensed, waiting for some kind of eruption of hyperviolence.\n\nInstead the armor gave a weird double-beep and opened.\n\nThe Terran inside was all bulky muscle and tattoos, with brown skin and close cut black hair. He stepped out, taking a second to stretch.\n\n\"Dhruv said to ping the ansible,\" Enraged Phillip said, moving forward. \"He needs you to ping a specific port, that'll signal him.\"\n\nA bunch of icons appeared between the mantid's armored antenna.\n\n\"Which port?\" the Warfather asked after a second.\n\nThe Terran made a snorting noise. \"I understand engineer, kid.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right,\" the Warfather sounded kind of embarrassed.\n\nTut'el felt suddenly angry. It was as if the Warfather was being deliberately shamed by the Terran.\n\n\"Dhruv said to show you this, that you'd understand it,\" the Terran said, holding out his hand. The holoprojector built into the Terran's palm spun up to life and flickering symbols started to appear.\n\nThe Warfather moved away slightly, going over by the empty suit. There was a singular tone and the Warfather's armor cracked open.\n\nThe private, Beatnik or whatever his name was, stepped forward, holding out a beer to the Warfather. Vuxten took the beer, took a long drink, then wiped his mouth, giving a sigh of pleasure.\n\n\"Forgot how hot she runs,\" Vuxten said.\n\n\"So that's Enraged Phillip?\" Beatnik asked.\n\nVuxten nodded.\n\n\"Thought he'd be bigger,\" Bit.nek said, shrugging.\n\n\"I'm in disguise,\" the Terran said without turning around.\n\n\"Makes sense. Wouldn't want a shade to recognize you and ask you about your armor's extended warranty,\" the Private shrugged. \"Catch.\"\n\nThe Terran didn't even look, just reached out and caught the beer, striking off the cap on the edge of a table with one smooth motion.\n\nTut'el moved over to the Warfather. \"Sir,\" he said. He looked around. \"Sir, don't you think that, well, with everything going on, we should be... uh... there should be... um, maybe we should...\"\n\nTut'el trailed off, unable to verbalize what was bothering him.\n\n\"Maybe we should be more urgent, running around, yelling, firing our weapons, and the like?\" Vuxten asked, his whiskers twitching with amusement.\n\n\"Feels like we should be doing *something*, right, Captain?\" Beatnik asked. He tossed another bottle of beer and Captain Tut'el caught it. \"Not just standing around drinking beer?\" The Private lit a Treana'ad smokestick, taking a few puffs and exhaling a cloud of smoke as he put the lighter away.\n\n\"Well... yes,\" Tut'el said.\n\n\"We are,\" Major Vuxten said. He took another drink. \"We're cutting off the superluminal communication system. That eliminates the enemy's reinforcements and prevents additional waves of enemy forces from entering the system. We are going to push out the methods of fighting the enemy, allowing people to defend themselves and others, allowing us to take the fight to what, at first, appeared to be an unstoppable enemy. What we're doing, just the six of us, is more than any other commander right now could accomplish with an entire armored division.\"\n\n\"And we don't have much time,\" He pointed outside. \"At least *half* of the population is dead. At least two thirds of the military is dead. That's over six billion souls, gone, and the number is increasing every second.\"\n\nThe Major rubbed his face then looked up. \"It's the early days of the Precursor Autonomous War Machine attacks all over again. All it needs is 'There Is Only Enough For One' to be booming out across the world every ten minutes or so, over and over, and screaming mobs of those driven to insanity to make this into my worst nightmare.\"\n\n\"Good job on getting here, Inertia says the other emergency broadcast stations aren't responding. This is the only operational one on the whole world,\" the big Terran suddenly said. \"He's going to activate the system and push the data packet to the survivors. Give them a chance to fight back.\"\n\n\"Hate this. Gimme something to actually fight,\" Beatnik said, exhaling smoke into the air.\n\n\"Steady, lad. Your time will come soon enough,\" the Major said. He turned and looked outside. \"They're mad.\"\n\nTut'el looked out, past where the vehicle was wedged into the front of the building, past the ragged hole the Terran had walked through.\n\nThe shades were sweeping through the streets. It looked to Tut'el like they were pouring down the sides of the buildings with antenna on the top, flowing through the streets and alleys like water.\n\nTut'el could hear their enraged shrieking even over the hum of hidden machinery.\n\nThe street lights flickered and turned red.\n\nShades caught in the light shrieked and flinched back, flickering out of the circle of red light to reappear near the light, pawing and clawing at an invisible cone.\n\n\"You do that, buddy?\" Major Vuxten asked 471. He frowned. \"Huh, I wonder who did.\"\n\n\"That's good. That means someone else is fighting in the method they're able to. They're thinking, looking past just their own door,\" the Terran rumbled. He gave a chuckle. \"My Father once told me that every one of the Malevolent Universe's children is capable of greatness, they have greatness inside of them, burning like the light of a sun. All they have to do is find it.\"\n\nTut'el swallowed thickly, then took a drink of his beer.\n\nThe Major unbuckled his torso armor, letting it hang to the side, then moved over and pushed his back against a standing piece of artwork. He moved up and down, scratching his back on the protrusions of the bizzarre piece of lobby art.\n\n\"Oh, that's the stuff,\" he said. He stepped away and rebuckled his armor. \"I get this itch just below by shoulder blades every time,\" he took another drink off his beer and then gave a sigh. \"First Telkan War, I had that itch all the time, used to drive me crazy. No matter how I wiggled, I couldn't seem to scratch it.\"\n\n\"I'm ticklish. During the Second Invasion of Anthill when I was armored up, I swore there was this little spider inside my armor's sleeve,\" the Terran suddenly said. \"The techs didn't believe me, nobody would believe me, but the little sucker would come out and bite my armpit and the inside of the my elbow. Plus, he kept triggering malfunction alerts in that arm. It was before I broke free of the Immortal conditioning, and there's this tiny spider, no bigger than the head of a pin, living in my armor's right arm.\"\n\nThe Warfather snickered. \"What happened?\"\n\nThe Terran gave a low laugh. \"I'm ticklish. That and the little itsy bitsy spider ruined the Imperium's day,\" the Terran stepped back. \"Ping me if you need me, Inertia.\"\n\nThe mantid flashed some icons.\n\nThe big Terran moved over and looked out the gap in the wall. \"I'm *really* ticklish. The little guy was crawling around in my armpit, Lord Knight Vertrumat was commanding me to lead another assault straight into the teeth of the Nine Canyons Hive, berating me for cowardice because I'd called off the assault and ordered a retreat when a half dozen Speakers had shown up.\n\n\"So the Lord Knight is berating me. He'd already slapped me few times, so my temper was up, and here's this itty bitty spider crawling in my armpit,\" the Terran said. He shaded his eyes. \"Huh, someone's turning all the room lights red. Good for them. Anyway, he's screaming at me, and his breath just *reeks* of curry. I hate curry. Dhruv used to sneak up on my while I was sleeping and smear curry under my nose,\" the Terran nodded. \"Guess it's a good thing these people have their lighting controls connected to the network.\n\n\"Anyway, he's screaming sour curry breath into my face, my armor is pinching my balls, and this spider is crawling in my armpit. The Immortals conditioning is leaving me standing there, but I'm getting madder and madder. Every time I wiggle, the Lord Knight screams at me. FIDO is standing there and he's whining but I can't scratch his petting nerve to calm him down,\" the Terran said.\n\n\"Suddenly, it just all crashes together. I start screaming at the top of my lungs, trying to rip my armor off, the Lord Knight is yelling at me, trying to reestablish control with codewords, the spider is biting my armpit, FIDO starts barking,\" The Terran suddenly laughed. \"By the time things had calmed down, Lord Knight Vertrumat was dead, I'd ripped the guts out of a Dominion class battleship, and I'm pulling apart my armor trying to find that spider.\"\n\nBeatnik snickered.\n\nThe Terran lifted up his hand. \"I found it. The little spider. Only...\" there was a slight flicker and a tiny spider, made all of minute code, appeared on the Terran's fingertip. \"It wasn't what I thought it was.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Beatnik asked, leaning forward.\n\n\"My Father had told me that even the smallest creature, even things we would overlook and ignore, have a purpose in the malevolent universe. He used this little thing as an example and gave it to me. It's like a Tommy's Gotcha. Your supposed to feed it, pet it, play with it. When the Combine slash Imperium took me and subjected me to the Immortals program, I'd forgotten about it. It hid, stored  in the smartlink in my forearm,\" the Terran said. He held up his finger, looking at the little spider. \"When I found it, sitting in the wreckage of the bridge of the ship, I am not ashamed to admit I wept.\n\n\"The last of the conditioning broke. I was the first Immortal to break free, as much as we ever did before the Lady Lord of Hell released our chains,\" the Terran said. The spider vanished.\n\n\"Think the Digital Omnimessiah meant for it to go down like that?\" Beatnik asked, handing the Terran another beer.\n\nThe case was half empty.\n\n\"I like to think so,\" Enraged Phillip said. He stood up. \"You seem to have this well in hand. Any particular reason you called for me?\"\n\nVuxten nodded. \"I know this sounds petty,\" he motioned at Beatnik and Tut'el. \"They'll probably die of shock, but I could really use a couple of favors.\"\n\nThe Biological Apostle Enraged Phillip, AKA Daxin \"The Walking War Crime\" Freeborn, gave a loud groan and slumped slightly. \"Fine.\"\n\n\\-----\n\n\"How's it looking out there?\" Brentili'ik asked. She was staring at a screen that would have shown newscast talking heads only a few hours before. Now it was displaying text.\n\n**USE TEXT OR AUDIO ONLY \\[STOP\\] VISUAL MEDIA CAUSES SPREAD OF KILLER GHOSTS \\[STOP\\] RED IN 880808 CREATES BARRIER \\[STOP\\] MEDIUM GROUND SODIUM CHLORIDE CRYSTALS ACROSS DOORWAYS OR WINDOWS CREATES BARRIER  \\[STOP\\] SODIUM CHLORIDE IN CIRCLE CREATES SAFE AREA \\[STOP\\] MYLAR WITH 0.5 MICRON ALUMINUM OXIDE LINER CREATES BARRIER \\[STOP\\] COLD IRON AND NON-ALLOYED IRON DISRUPTS GHOSTS \\[STOP\\] STAY TUNED TO THIS CHANNEL OR OUR AUDIO ALERTS ON 102.5 MHz KBOY \\[STOP\\]**\n\nHer intelligence officer glanced at his datapad, checking the text. \"There hasn't been any reported attacks in the last four hours.\"\n\nBrentili'ik opened her mouth to reply when the words thundered through her very bone marrow.\n\n**LET THIS WORLD SHAKE IN THE WRATH OF LOST TERRASOL**\n\nThere was the booming a vast iron doors then the clattering of heavy iron chains. From outside there was a crashing explosion that made the pictures clatter on the walls.\n\nEveryone else had dove to the ground, leaving Brentili'ik standing alone in her office. She slowly turned from the desk to look outside.\n\nA large suit of Terran combat armor was walking across the lawn, brushing away smoking dirt from the forearms. The suit stopped at the window and tapped on it with one armored finger.\n\nBrentili'ik reached out and opened the window.\n\nThe armor's skull faceplate retracted, revealing a brown skinned Terran male's face with chrome tears tattooed next to one eye.\n\n\"Missus Brentili'ik?\" the Terran asked.\n\n\"I am she,\" Brentili'ik said, holding tight to her courage when every fiber of her being shrieked at her to run away.\n\n\"I'm a friend of your husband, Vuxten,\" the Terran said.\n\n\"I am aware of my husband's name, Terran,\" Brentili'ik said, holding on to her sanity with both hands.\n\nThe Terran flashed one of those toothy smiles. \"He'll be happy to hear that.\"\n\nBrentili'ik barked a laugh.\n\n\"He just wanted me to see if you were all right,\" the Terran said. He turned slightly at the waist and looked behind him. \"Sorry about the entrance. You've got a Case Omaha going on and that entrance is kind of hard coded into the system to go off if there's a Case Omaha in effect.\"\n\nBrentili'ik nodded. \"I understand.\"\n\nAn armored goodboi chassis reared up, putting its front paws on the windowsill.\n\n\\*\\*I am FIDO\\*\\* it said.\n\nBrentili'ik, familiar with Flopsy, reached out and scratched between the robotic ears. \"And you are a goodboi.\"\n\nThe Terran's smile got wider. \"Looks like you have everything under control here, Missus Brentili'ik. Anything I should know?\"\n\nBrentili'ik wanted to take a deep breath but instead just nodded slowly. \"The Telkan system appears to have a unique situation going on, if you would like to stand in the window and take part in the briefing? I would offer to let you come into the office but I am unsure if your armor would be able to fit through the hallways.\"\n\n\"This is good enough,\" the armored Terran said. He leaned against the window, his arms folded. \"Daxin Freeborn, known to most people as Enraged Phillip.\"\n\n\"Brentili'ik,\" she said.\n\nThe Terran nodded, smiling slightly. The armored goodboi dropped down and raced across the lawn, barking at birds.\n\nThe rest of the staff just stared at Madam Director Brentili'ik dealt with the imposing Terran without so much as a whisker out of place.\n\n\"Well?\" Brentili'ik snapped, clapping her hands together. \"Stand up. You were all saying we needed to get the information out to the other systems. Now we have a chance.\"\n\n\\-----\n\nFenn finished spraying the wall with a light coat of red paint and stepped back. The windows had been covered by mylar, with ground sodium chloride crystals across the windowsills. She had an iron bar, something the nutriforge had called an \"iron rebar - one each\" leaning on the wall next to the window.\n\nShe lifted up one of the mylar sheets over the window, glanced outside and shuddered.\n\n\"Is she still out there?\" her husband, Inkree, asked, raising the face shield from his sweaty face. With one hand he was shaking a spray can of red paint. \"Finished upstairs.\"\n\n\"She is,\" Fenn nodded, letting the mylar strip drop.\n\nHer niece, Dambree, was outside on the lawn where shades were swirling around her. None had gotten close and Aunt Fenn wasn't sure why. She turned to her husband. \"Do a check, make sure the outside walls are coated.\"\n\nInkree nodded, moving away, still shaking the can of paint. He gave a sharp nod and the clear face shield dropped back down.\n\nIn the frontroom Meglee looked out the window between the small gap between two mylar panels, the size of a sheet of paper, on one of the windows.\n\nOutside, in the sunlit day, on the front lawn Dambree was dressed in a flowing dress, dark colored with dark crimson edging, kneeling in the middle of the lawn, her hands folded in front of her, head up, face raised to the sky, eyes closed, lips moving as she sang.\n\nShe was surrounded by a nimbus of light.\n\nBeyond the light, which was visible even though it was daylight outside, the light gold in color, shades swirled around the kneeling Hesstlan woman.\n\nMeglee could hear Dambree singing even inside. It was a strange language, lyrical and musical, flowing words that seemed slow and stately.\n\nThe lyrics, the words, almost felt threatening to Meglee despite the fact that Dambree had translated the lyrics for Meglee before. While it was almost a dirge, almost a litany of defeat, but Dambree had taught her that it was a litany of hope and faith.\n\n\"What's she doing?\"  Pulngee, Dambree's baby sister, asked.\n\n\"Singing,\" Meglee said. \"It's somehow keeping those... those *things* away from her.\"\n\nPunee nodded, moving up and pressing her nose against the mylar and shifting her face so that one eye was even with a gap so she could see better.\n\nHer sister was kneeling in the middle of a circle of light, visible despite the sunlit day, with shades swirling around her.\n\nPunee noticed that there were some shades that were kneeling down around her sister, almost as if they were joining her in their songs. Some had their heads bowed, others had their faces lifted, some had their hands pressed together, others were wringing their hands.\n\n\"Aren't you worried?\" Meglee asked her cousin.\n\nPunee shook her head. \"She knows what she's doing,\" she said.\n\nAll of her life Punee had believed in her sister with all of her heart.\n\nOutside, Dambree could feel the rage of the shades around her. It was a rush of water, like standing knee deep in the fast flowing shallow rapids of a river of heated water. She could feel them moving around her, feel them trying to assault her.\n\nThey were the faint summer breeze compared to the rage she had withstood before.\n\nDambree raised her face, feeling her love for her family fill her, her eyes closed. She reached out, her voice upraised in song. She got to her feet, spreading her arms out, raising her voice louder so that her song echoed off the surrounding houses.\n\nShe could feel the pain, the agony, the despair that filled the shades around her. The horror, the rage,  the crushing despair of their deaths that filled them. She reached out with her voice, with her heart, to the shades around her, calling them to her, beseeching them to come to her and hear her voice, hear her words.\n\nFaintly, Dambree could hear some of the shades were beginning to sing along with her.\n\n\"Ave Imperator! Before you, I am cleansed! Remove me from the pain of the flame and grant me mercy at my end!\"\n\nMeglee and Punee were watching out the window.\n\nThere was a flicker. A distortion in the air, like heat ripples over a hot highway on a hot summer's day in the desert.\n\nThe grass waved as if a breeze had emanated from the distortion, flowers erupting from the grass and blooming. The trees bloomed. A rainbow appeared in the clear blue sky. There was a burst of golden light and the sound of music.\n\nA man made of swirling blue code with silver patches appeared next to Dambree.\n\nMeglee and Punee could hear his voice clearly.\n\n\"It appears that your people are in need of my assistance and I hope that I am not too late, my beloved child.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xipj03/first_contact_chapter_839_book_of_the_dead/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xov9s2/first_contact_chapter_841_names_of_the_fallen/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

        "body": "It's Friday again.\n\nI'm glad for that.\n\nAbout two hours ago we got good news, so stress there is relieved.\n\nThere's still a few things to worry about but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n\nI've got one editor for the early books, so we can get those edited while poor Dave works on the seventh book and next the eighth book.\n\nSome worry on the covers. My cover artist has suffered some life disruption due to the Second Russia/Ukraine War so I'm a little stressed about the cover for books eight and the cover for the omnibus of books 1 through 3 (or 5, depending on what tricks I can pull with the layout).\n\nNow, for your weekend safety briefing!\n\nIt's Friday, which means another weekend we can all get in trouble. Don't drink and drive. Don't beat your significant other unless both of you are into that. Don't beat your spouse, your girl/boy/xirfriend, your kids, your parents, or your pets. Don't pet the midget after midnight, she bites. Whiskey is a good disinfectant and tastes good too. Don't buy, sell, transport, manufacture, or use illegal drugs. Run toward the screams if you can help.\n\nOn that, take the time to take care of yourself. Life isn't easy and death comes for us all. Keep your head up even when someone or something tries to hold it down.\n\nLove yourself, love other people, smile at yourself in the mirror, close your eyes and give yourself a hug. Touch a friend on the shoulder.\n\nLive, my friends. Just live.\n\nRemember to take time for yourself, even if it's just a couple of minutes or a few seconds.\n\nRemember, before you do something you regret, go somewhere, ball your fists, clench your toes, close your eyes, and slowly count to ten. That might help.\n\nJust care for yourself, and when you can, for someone else.\n\nI guess, with that, it's rattle the tin cup time.\n\nPayPal: https://paypal.me/RaltsBloodthorne  \nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/First_Contact  \nFirst_ContactBooks: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RYK5F88  \nBEHOLD HUMANITY! https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H5ZZL93",

It taught the Terrans that the universe will take whatever you care about most and laugh while it does so. There are rumors that it wasn't until after the Friend Plague that Terran psykers were able to muster the rage necessary to wield phasic energy. \n\nIt is no wonder that the weapons and calls of the Friends affect Terran Psychic Shades. \n\nAnd no sooner was the Friend Plague cured, than the Terrans died en masse in the Great Terran Die-off. Now, the dogs and cats, uplifted and unuplifted alike, tasted what their friends did in their absence. And they found the taste bitter.\n\nThis bitterness was compounded by the fact that, for most of the Friends, the closest thing they had left was the Shades.\n\nEventually, all were reunited, but it was a long and painful road for both sides. When reunion finally was possible, the celebrations spanned constellations, and in some places continue still. As bitter as the absence had been, reunion was that much sweeter.\n\nIt is in this spirit that I open unto you: CerBastElysium, a world dedicated entirely to hosting a constant celebration of this historic reunion! Ride rides, consume confections, and celebrate this joy from now until the end of time!\n\n-(opening speech of CerBastElysium, 1 week post-C3)",

    "body": "There’s a whine from deep inside her. She doesn’t want to let him go. Little Johnny is so sweet and cute and... She gives herself a chop across the muzzle with her free paw. Not only is Johnny going to the family that adores him, but to his birth mother and father as well. Some random pirate pretending to be a good person isn’t going to cut it for a growing boy. The final door opens and there’s a flurry of movement as the entire pack all but pounces on her and Johnny.\n\nJohnny is swept away and she has to resist taking a chunk out of someone as the tiny child on the mend is swept into a world of concerned nuzzles, kisses and reassurances. There’s a faint and soft voice that asks for calm and things settle down in a hurry. Johnny is now lying on the back of a full grown Lopen man who walks up to Agenda on soft pads without the telltale click of claws. He’s impeccably groomed and almost artistically attractive. If the man was on a poster she’d expect that he had been photoshopped to look that pretty.\n\n“I vould like to zank you for ‘elpink my zon in zis trying time.” He says slowly and Agenda blinks in confusion.\n\n“Why are you faking a Mekken Reach Accent?” Agenda asks and he looks offended.\n\n“Vat? Mein accent is not faked. Hye was risen from puphood vithin zee Glorious Reach!” He protests.\n\n“And I was born in Cruel Space. That doesn’t mean I have to mangle Galactic Trade through being sloppy.” Miles says leaning into view. “Afternoon.” He says to the stunned group.\n\n“Vat? A Tret from zee Death Zone?” The Loper man says and Miles snorts.\n\n“Human. Our first ambassador to the Federation of Systems is on route.”\n\n“And you are?”\n\n“Commander Miles Brent, I’m attached to the EFL Tiger as both a crewmember and liaison to The Dauntless. You’re Mister Howl?”\n\n“Gruber. Gruber Howl.” Gruber says and Miles nods. “Zo... ‘uman ya? Vat kind of race are you?”\n\n“BMO hundred to hundred. Only one like us.” He says and Agenda sighs. “Oh, right sorry.” He says at the stunned look of the crowd, he then leans out of sight.\n\n“Mein loves, comfort our zon, Hye must speak vis sis man.” Gruber says before gently picking up Johnny.\n\n“My zon, say your goodbyes to Mizz Lilpaw, we are going home after zis ya?”\n\n“Yes father.” Johnny says as he’s slowly lowered to the ground.\n\n“You, ve tok between men ya?” Gruber asks stepping out of the room and looking straight at Miles.\n\n“Sure. You alright with this?” Miles responds before glancing up towards Agenda.\n\n“Yes, go have your chat. I’ll be fine.” Agenda assures him.\n\nGruber gestures for Miles to follow as Agenda walks into the room with his wives, he leads Miles some steps away where they can’t be heard casually by those in the room.\n\n“Zo... a new zpeziez?” Gruber asks his accent getting thick enough to serve as armour plating.\n\n“Human. Our diplomatic ship is apparently taking a detour to get around some Arrangement Systems. Too many men aboard for it to be anything but a massive time sink.”\n\n“If you’ze being honest about zee amount of men zere are compared to vomen zen zat iz most understandable. But zat is concern for later. My zon. He...” Gruber pauses before swallowing and speaking slowly to clear away his accent. “What have you done to him? He carries himself with too much grace for one who has been through horror.”\n\n“Myself and the other men put things into perspective for him and told him about his choices.”\n\n“Choices?”\n\n“Be crushed under the pain of that day, or stand on it and rise above it. Granted it took all of us trying to explain it about five different ways each for it to actually make sense to him. There’s a lot of cultural drift.”\n\n“Hye kan imagine. Ze beast. Zat creature zat killt my wives... Is it deat?” Gruber asks and Miles gives a vicious smile. “Dit it suffer?”\n\n“We chained it up, dragged it into the ship and cut it up for parts. Cooked it and ate it. Your son had a plateful himself, as did every crew member that can stomach meat.”\n\n“Is zere any left?” Gruber asks with a distant look of hate.\n\n“Sorry, my kind has a heavy poison resistance. We’re marinating the remaining meat, the amounts we put on them have a shot of killing you from smell alone.”\n\n“Vat vas it? Ze message stated zat it was an animal, but ze word murder vas used.”\n\n“Apparently Flame Spewers are thinking beings. I say that they taste good with... what’s it called Galactic Trade? Ah yes, ground pain kernels and sodium chloride.”\n\n“Hyu do realize zat boz of zem are used in torture yes?” Gruber asks and Miles raises an eyebrow.\n\n“I know they could theoretically be used in torture mostly because if you get them in a cut it hurts, but I usually just eat the stuff. It’s used to make food taste better.” Miles says and Gruber nods at the babbling, positive things are fine. “The question is how do you know that (pepper) and (salt) can be used in torture? Seems like some awfully specific knowledge.”\n\n“Oh nein, nein. Hye did not know Hye merely assumed.”\n\n“Of course.” Miles says as he checks the small computer on his wrist. Axiom tech was somthing he was really starting to appreciate. “By the by, how did the sale go?”\n\n“Zale? Vhat Zale?” Gruber asks, clearly on the defensive.\n\n“I’m a sniper, a type of military assassin; I work with a crew of mercenaries. My fellows are saboteurs and trained brutes. You availed yourself of the black market and I honestly don’t care. I’m just trying to make conversation while the girls fuss over your son.”\n\n“Zen all Hye vill say is zat when you have a great deal of zings zat have not been gained in vays ozers approve zen zey must be solt in vays zey von’t see.”\n\n“I understand. Much of the things I use so my meals don’t bore me to tears are less than approved of by paper pushers.”\n\n“Zat makes sense.”\n\n“Which means you can brag if you want, you chose a good spot so no one can listen in.”\n\n“Hye needed to know if Hye had ze option of shootink you if needed.”\n\n“It goes both ways.”\n\n“Writ Industries Plasma Pistol.”\n\n“Berretta nine millimetre. Hollow point bullets.”\n\n“Iz zat kinetic?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n“Interestink, you vont be bringink zis up vith the vives?”\n\n“All men need a hobby.”\n\n“Yes, ve do. Mine is to be part of a gentleman’s klub. Ve enrich our lives vit... more darink means zen most.”\n\n“I understand, I’m afraid I can’t match it though. Due to my species being so new on the scene I feel like I’m living in sin just keeping my little part of the ship happy.”\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Yea, I’ve had one or two girlfriend before shipping out to the stars, but the one that didn’t cheat went stalker on me. Now I’m dealing with dozens of gorgeous women who can’t get enough of the Miles!”\n\n“Ze simple zings in life are often unappreciated, vizout context.”\n\n“Just remember to balance your enrichment against what you already have, dozens of loving ladies and at least one adorable son.”\n\n“Many dotters as vell, in zat light Hye am truly blessed.” Gruber says before slowly standing up and leaning against the wall next to Miles, towering over the human like a giant. “Zo... vat’s it like lifink vizout vomen eferyvere?”\n\n“It can be pretty lonely. If you’re hurt you have to suck it up, if you have a problem you have to solve it, asking for help can be seen as a weakness and being soft just gets you laughed at. I don’t know if it’s better outside Cruel Space though. It’s a gentler life it looks like, but that sort of thing doesn’t let a man face adversity and grow. It’s probably not so bad on the EFL Tiger, those women are mercenaries after all, but still, I’m being coddled.”\n\n“Zat is ze problem ven ze Galaxy values you more zen you do. Zey place limits upon zings. Vether or not zose limits are in your vay matters little. Zey are shtill zere.”\n\n“Still, moping never gets anything done. Got any tips or tricks for getting around it?”\n\n“Of course mein Friend! It kan be most easy. You need to zimply play through zere expectations! Like affecting a thicker accent than usual, or pretending that your gang is just a club of friends. Knowing where the less than... legitimate businesses are also helps.” Gruber says with a huge smile full of gleaming dagger like teeth. Miles matches it.\n\n“Play the system. Got it. It seems to be the general attitude the Admiral has anyways.”\n\n“Sounds like a smart man. Perhaps the political scene will be more than just a gigantic waste of tax credits and time now? I’ll have to pay some more attention, any advice?”\n\n“Yea, there is one concern. One of the products we’ve already started selling is a candy called chocolate. A lot of beings can eat it, but it’s poisonous to canines on our home world. Be careful.”\n\n“Noted, as for advice of my own I suggest learning at least a small amount of the Axiom arts. A small amount of physical enhancement can work wonders when properly timed.”\n\n“Shit.” Miles groans as he hangs his head.\n\n“Story, now.” Gruber orders with a smile.\n\n“One of my fellows is obsessed with Axiom and he’s already insane enough without being told he’s right. What are the styles in its use? I’ve lived my life all but swimming in Null.” Miles asks fishing a little bit to see how much of Franklin’s rambling is accurate.\n\n“There are two styles, the Weaving and the Wielding. The Wielding is what I recommend, it allows the conjuring of weapons at higher levels of discipline and can increase your physical capacity. The Weaving however can be massively potent but difficult to control.”\n\n“Just two ways?”\n\n“Technically nearly all technology use is some form of Axiom use, but technically correct only really matters to those proving a pedantic point and paperwork.”\n\n“Good to know. Also if you’d happen to be in the mood to tell me how hard or easy it is to pull off some less than legal extra-curricular activities I’d be deeply appreciative.”\n\n“Of course!” He almost cheers before leaning out and glancing down the hallways before smiling widely. “First you need a loyal crew of gents...”\n\nThe explanation is cut off by a roar and the sounds of something being slammed into something metallic.\n\n“I know one of you guys is involved with that, what’s going on?” Miles demands into his wrist computer.\n\n“Land dragon slipped a chain down here. Victor suplexed it.” Marcus answers in a stunned tone.\n\n“He what?!” Miles demands, positive he misheard that.\n\n“The Russian gave a dragon a German suplex.” Marcus says slowly.\n\n“What is a German suplex?” Gruber asks.\n\n“Do you have it on video?” Miles asks very much wanting to see something like that.\n\n“Hang on. I’ll ask... nevermind.”  He says as he gets an email from Ryu. It’s entitled, “I’ll be adding effects later.”\n\nThe video plays as Gruber leans over him for a good look. There’s an enormous wingless Flame Spewer chained beside the entrance to a bar with a sign denoting that troublemakers will be fed to Umbubu.\n\nSome idiot flaunts a hunk of meat they’d bought in front of the dragon beast and Umbubu snaps for it, and gets not only the meat but an arm as well. Its lunge snaps the chain and sensing its freedom the brutal being begins rushing towards the camera, then a pale blur slams into it from the side with a deep bellow. The eyes of the monster grow comically large as it finds itself flung upwards and backwards until it’s slammed into the floor. A comparatively smaller form can be seen holding it around the base of tail before letting go and letting out a cheer.\n\nThe video shifts to show the scene from the side, the snapping chain, the blood, the scream and then the pale man rushes to the side, dodges a flailing clawed foot and grabs it around the base of the tail before heaving himself and the beast backwards to slam it into the deck plating. Then it shows it from directly above. Miles turns the display off and slowly turns to look up at Gruber who leans away to no longer crowd him.\n\n“Is your entire species insane?” He asks and Miles opens his mouth to refute this before pausing and thinking. Then he shrugs. “Fantastic. I look forward to what your race brings to the Galaxy.”\n\n“Was that sarcasm?”\n\n“Oh no. You must understand Sir Brent. Life is... dull outside of your Cruel Space. A man grows up and lives their life wanting nothing. There is no goal to strive for, nothing to prove to anyone and no expectations upon you. A cage of velvet and gold, but a cage none the less. They call it... Male Obsession when we chafe at these limits.” Gruber explains.\n\n“So I was much more on the nose than I thought when I said all men need a hobby.” Miles remarks.\n\n“You don’t know the half of it.” Gruber confirms before glancing towards the room with the girls. “Excuse me, but we’ve spent too long away from the girls. They’ll start to question if we’re much longer. It’s important to know where the limits are.” He says lowering down to all fours and walking to the room his thick accent back in place. Miles follows him in with a smile that’s somewhat plastered on.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nnvv5h/out_of_cruel_space_part_12/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/npbrvr/out_of_cruel_space_part_14/)",

All inhabited worlds are heavily industried and those that aren’t are nature preserves. Nearly a full percent of the galaxy is in the Mekken Reach which have a singular shared language that presses in what sounds like a German accent into Galactic Trade. They’re a very pragmatic people but have an oddly low amount of Adepts.\n\nArrangement Systems: There are some systems that take a heavy handed approach to the gender imbalance. In these systems if a man does not have a hundred registered wives they will be detained and assigned wives. This is legal enough for the rest of the galaxy to acknowledge these marriages and a lot of bachelorettes make sure their names are on the lists. They don’t expect it to work, but they also work to expand the influence of the Arrangement Systems.\n\n\r  \nMale Obsession: Males the Galaxy over suffer from a lack of purpose and direction. Wanting for nothing due to the sheer gentleness in which the galaxy treats them they are left with luxurious but empty lives leading the vast majority to lash out in any way they can. Most wives consider it part of their duty to either distract them away from their obsession to providing them a positive outlet. This fails as often as it succeeds leading to a fair number of unusual expressions of art and effort the galaxy over. Crime, theft in particular and even assassination are considered to be utterly thrilling diversions and the fields are shockingly male oriented. They also do incredible spy work and often have massive effect on galactic policy. Behind every driven woman is an obsessed man some say.",

I like gruber, I may not share his views on legal situations (or rather illegal situations in this case) but he is definitely a man of practicality with a healthy dose of realism it seems, the accent might be a bit much but considering what he said about it, I’m not entirely against it, but the bigger question is why does he have what seems like a German accent? Shouldn’t he have an accent where growls or quick vocalizations are more emphasized due to him being similar to canines?",

Proof of life is... oh, I don't know. I saw a bird today, at least, what passes for a bird here locally. More like a lizard with wings. But it tries to sing and the singing reminds me of the sound my first ground-car made.*\n\n*Let's get it out of the way.*\n\n*The color 880808 will block the shades attacks as well as keep them from moving through an object when painted with it. The color used as light is difficult for a shade to enter but they CAN enter it.*\n\n*Mylar with a 0.25 micron layer of aluminum oxide works as another barrier, although something about the shade's touch causes the aluminum oxide to slowly vanish. You can hide under a mylar safety blanket, but you'll be able to feel the shades touching the blanket.*\n\n*Just another data point for those who come after, I guess.*\n\n*The sound of a goodboi howl will cause them to vanish or even flee. Even a recording will work.*\n\n*You become used to what I've heard referred to as \"The Baskerville Choir\" after a while.*\n\n*The hissing of a purrboi will get them to flee.*\n\n*Goobois, Purrbois, and Terran Descent Humans are able to fight these things without armor.*\n\n*Too bad there's not very many of them.*\n\n*Sodium lights work. The shades don't like the light. Make sure it's in the yellow specturm. If you go full bluish white, they congregate under the light.*\n\n*Sodium chloride (you can even have iodine additives) for a barrier or to disrupt the shades if flicked at them. The sodium chloride line must be at least a quarter inch thick and completely cover the surface for it to be effective. Spread across doorways and window sills.*\n\n*You can also put a circle around yourself if you're in trouble.*\n\n*Iron weapons. Projectiles don't work that well, unless you're Terran or lucky enough to be Enraged.*\n\n*They seek out phasic energy. Stay away from the Atrekna, the Dwellerspawn, and your local psychic.*\n\n*You can use a barrier of iron oxide in place of salt. (Thanks to the Hesstlan Code Station broadcast for that before their ansible went offline)*\n\n*Remember, you can see them easier at night.*\n\n*Well, that's about it for today.*\n\n*You can probably tell I'm tired.*\n\n*Me and the others are going to try to break out of the city tonight. There's supposedly a Terran military base in the mountains, we're going for it.*\n\n*If nothing else, to make sure their superluminal communications system is down.*\n\n*Good luck. Stay alive and remember: you aren't alone.*  \\- Recorded Broadcast from the front Lines of Iron Piglet; Journalist unknown (Presumed Killed in Action, remains unrecovered, file header damaged)\n\n\"You have no idea the lengths I will go to survive.\" - Unknown Terran, recording fragment found in ruins. No Terran remains discovered.\n\n*\"We Stopped the Signal, Mal!\"* \\- Graffiti found in VR space. Origin unknown.\n\nAhead of him was the tunnel that led to the ansibles, led to the superluminal signal propagation systems. It was a virtual construct, the walls of error and virus checkers, the lights file header sorters and designation routers.\n\nThe convoy of heavy tractor trailer rigs were all heading straight for it.\n\nOn either side were vehicles that were weaving back and forth, the digital representation of the drivers all screaming and clawing at their own faces, beating their faces on the dashboards or the steering wheels, or fighting with one another.\n\nNormies caught in the system and attacked by the emp-shades.\n\nThe cop and SWAT vehicles had dropped back, the heavy forms of black ICE roaring out their authority over the area. The eVI and VI security programs deferring to the big boys.\n\nThe eVI and the VI couldn't see what Crashrider could see.\n\nThe black ICE was swarmed by emp-shades. They were fighting for the digital lives against the cold icy touch of the dead Terrans. Even as Crashrider watched one slumped down, falling to pieces, the emp-shades ripping at its form, tearing away data to cram into their mouths.\n\nHis eyes narrowed as he saw that the emp-shades screamed in wrath, the digital flesh and blood of the black ICE pouring from their mouths as they shrieked.\n\nThe black ICE didn't have what the emp-shades wanted.\n\nHis eyes shielded by his mirror shades, he looked around again, checking for any threats.\n\nCrashrider held his Caught-Tonya blade with one hand, his SMG in the other, staring ahead of him. His left hand was bleeding, the digital flesh carved with \"We Gotta Stop the Signal, Mal\" on it. One lens of his mirrorshades was cracked but slowly repairing.\n\nDime and Plushie were on his left, Talon and Rain on his right. All of them crouched down, one knee pressed against the top of the tractor-trailer that was full of corporate inventory files heading for the Maggie's Love Line.\n\nThe digital Mag-Lev.\n\nStraight to the ansibles. Straight to the hypercom wave repeaters. Straight to everything.\n\n\"Nobody's ever ridden Maggie and survived to tell the tale,\" Dime yelled over the buffeting wind.\n\n\"Guess someone's gotta pop Maggie's cherry!\" Crashrider yelled back. He sheathed his Caught-Tonya across his back, reloading his SMG with DDOS and hijack rounds.\n\nSteel Talon, the last of Crashrider's original guild members, who had been an Alpha Tester and an ARG player just like Crash, nodded grimly. \"Nothing to lose in meat or code,\" she said.\n\n\"I'ma withsa yousa,\" Plushie said. He gave a short, sharp laugh and switched from 1337-speak to regular Unified Standard. \"Overseers always told me I wouldn't amount to anything and I should be grateful to them.\" The other runner looked around himself. \"Guess the joke's on them, I'm about to flame out spectacularly.\"\n\n\"Crash...\" Rain said, pointing at the front of the truck.\n\nIt had put on its turn signal, heading for the virus check station. One of the dummy VI's had somehow twigged onto the runners and was flagging the triple trailer semi into the station.\n\nCrashrider looked around.\n\nNothing but smaller cars.\n\nAll driven by people driven mad.\n\nCrash closed his eyes for a second.\n\n*No matter how much chrome, the heart never changes,* he told himself.\n\nHe opened his eyes, looking at the various vehicles.\n\n\"Everyone take a car,\" he said, reaching down and drawing a knife that was little more than a browser hijacker forged into a blade. \"Use these. Stab the poor sod in the driver's seat and head for the superluminals. I'm going to try something.\"\n\nEveryone nodded.\n\nSteel Talon leaned forward, bumping her forehead against his before standing up, taking two steps, and jumping off the back of the semi-trailer. She somersaulted in midair, tucking her legs tight, the chrome tips of her boots catching the sun for a second.\n\nCrash turned his attention back to the station, putting the knife back in the sheathe.\n\nThere was still security everywhere, all of it designed to keep rogue code from the ansibles.\n\nA legacy of the Precursor War from where the Autonomous War Machines had hijacked large swaths of GalNet and broadcast their terrible actions.\n\nThe truck slowed and came to a stop.\n\nCrashrider burst into motion, jumping off the top, spinning in midair to bring targets into sight. He held the SMG tight, one hand around the grip, the other on the forward handle, finger on the trigger. The bursts were short, tight, only two to five rounds. His implanted smartwire fed the data to his eyes and brain, which knew exactly when to fire.\n\nThe initial flagger went down, its chest blown open, blood spraying. The two guards by the door went down, both of them shot through the chest.\n\nThere was an alarm and a dozen security guards popped up from the ground like whack-a-moles, but Crash was ready. He'd seen the glimmering in the code of the ground.\n\nHe emptied his magazine on the last guard and he let the SMG fall on the strap as he broke into a run toward the main building.\n\nIt wasn't a large building, but Crash knew that looks could be deceiving.\n\nIt was the packet authorization and switching station for the entire ansible system.\n\nThe Caught-Tonya blade sang and sparkled as Crash drew it even as he rushed forward.\n\nA guard tried to close the door, but a thrust of the blade transfixed the guard and stopped the door. Crash stepped through, tasting blueberries, and hacked down two more guards. One further down the hall fired their heavy pistol.\n\nHe was in The Zone.\n\nHe parried all nine bullets, the code packets hitting the wall in a shower of sparks.\n\nThe guard threw the pistol at Crash, who parried it, catching it with the edge of the blade, swishing the blade around, and throwing the pistol back.\n\nThe butt of the pistol slammed between the guard's eyes and the guard dropped.\n\nThree steps and Crash was over the supine guard, putting his shoulder into the door. The barrier exploded as his cracker busted the encryption on the first try and Crash rolled into the room.\n\nThe bullets of the security forces tore into the wall at would have been waist level if he had walked into the room. Instead, the bullets snapped over his head, even as he drew his own pistol and came up on one knee, the Caught-Tonya held out from his body at a 45 degree angle, his pistol held out, the smartlink in the Ares Predator-II synched up perfectly.\n\nHe emptied the magazine, a single bullet for each of the secmen. Each bullet punching through a weak spot in the armor and crashing each of the security programs.\n\nCrash didn't waste time, coming up smoothly, reloading his pistol one handed before holstering it.\n\nA kick drove open the control room.\n\nA half dozen emp shades rushed him.\n\nHe was in the zone.\n\nHe was a Animeland cherry blossom floating in the reflection of the moon on a perfectly still pond of black water.\n\nTwo slashes and they all shrieked, shattering and dissolving even as he dodged out of the way of the two grabs at him.\n\nThree avatars rushed him, foaming at the mouth, their eyes wild.\n\nA single cut and they all dropped, derezzing immediately, their home decks or wage-decks slagging out as the malicious code embedded in the Caught-Tonya fried out the electronics they used to log into GalNet.\n\nCrash moved up to the controls, glancing at the board.\n\nHe could see which cars his friends were in. See that the automated systems had flagged all three cars for stop and search.\n\nCrash typed without looking at the keyboard, rapidly altering the flow of code.\n\nOne by one the cars were cleared, overriden, and Crash watched them vanish into the tunnels, each heading toward one of the superluminal systems.\n\nWith a single exception.\n\nThe Maggie's Love Line and the Hypercom Wave system.\n\nRunning it naked was impossible. Everyone knew it. You had to use dedicated lines.\n\nEven the authorized systems could only use text interfaces and limited 2.5D GUIs. No VR or eVR for the Hypercom Wave, which was the main backbone for the realtime eVR linkages that surpassed even GalNet's ability.\n\nIt was impossible.\n\nCrash closed his eyes again.\n\n*I am the chrome blossom floating inside the reflection of the moon upon the waters of the black digital pond.*\n\nHe opened them and headed for the exit.\n\nTwice emp shades burst out at him, twice he cut with the Caught-Tonya, slicing them in half and moving on before they had even finished dissipating.\n\nHe burst out into the parking lot, kicking open the heavy steel door.\n\nA glance up showed a sky the color of a tri-vee turned to a dead channel.\n\nThe stars had gone out.\n\nCrash ran for the nearest vehicle, a police cruiser. He jumped as he got close, leading with his boots, crashing through the ID check and password, into the driver's seat in a shower of burst code. A slam with his palm brought the cruiser to life.\n\nSecmen ran out of the building, firing assault rifles, hitting the light armor t he cruiser. Sparks exploded off, the back window shattered, and Crash grunted as a round went through the trunk, through the back seat, and through the back of his seat, catching him just under the bottom of his body armor.\n\nCrash stomped the pedal, wishing he had his old motorcycle, which he'd lost on a run on a Smaug itself. The car fishtailed as it screeched out of the parkinglot. Two guards popped up, firing pistols, and Crash ducked down, slamming the grill into both of them, sending them flying over the top of the car even as they derezzed.\n\nA couple of punches, half standing up, and the windshield flew away, vanishing as he pulled into traffic, swerving across a dozen lanes. A semi-truck caught the ass of the cruiser, ripping away the bumper, but Crash got it under control.\n\nSWAT choppers filled the dead sky, their black armor merging almost flawlessly with the background. Dev textures started popping in and out and one of the choppers got tangled with the sky as textures overlaid it. The explosion was greasy, but Crashrider didn't notice.\n\nMaggie's Mouth yawned open in front of him.\n\nHe looked back once.\n\nThe city, normally gleaming chrome and sparkling lights, was awash with red light, whole sections going dark.\n\nHe looked forward at the mouth of the tunnel.\n\nHis fingerless leather gloves creaked as he tightened his grip on the steering wheel, the wind in his face and ruffling his hair. His mirrorshades were missing the left lens and his eye watered even though he was squinting.\n\nHe didn't close his eyes as the car crossed the threshhold.\n\nHe was Crashrider.\n\nAnd he was in The Zone.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xt7hkk/first_contact_chapter_842_names_of_the_fallen/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/y440dt/first_contact_chapter_844_names_of_the_fallen/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

He had led a small, quiet life, and had been happy with it. He had worked at a factory, at the entrances, checking IDs before buzzing people through the door. When the Terrans liberated his world he had started working at the spaceport, checking IDs at customs. He had a modest apartment, with modest possessions, and was modest about his few and modest accomplishments. He had had a few romantic flings, nothing that holodramas would be made about, but satisfying in a modest way.\n\nHe had been happy with his life. Contentment had filled him and he had looked forward to a plain appearing spouse, some average children, and, eventually, passing away comfortably in a bed somewhere, the Bliss taking him at the end.\n\nWhich meant he had been wholly unprepared for the Earthling with the strange eyes and stranger clothing bursting into his life, followed by thousands of dead Terrans, and an apocalypse falling upon his homeworld.\n\nHis content little life had been uprooted by a handful of simple words.\n\n\"Come with me if you want to live.\"\n\nNow he was in the basement of the Civil Defense Administration building.\n\nIn a room lit by red lights.\n\nCrouched inside a circle of sodium chloride crystals.\n\nA weapon called a shotgun held in his hands, the butt against his shoulder.\n\nHis finger on the trigger.\n\nA phasic shade of a Terran on the other side of the circle of crystalline powder.\n\nHe pulled the trigger.\n\n<click>  \n\n\nThe sound reverberated across his soul, something he hadn't even believed in until he saw other being's souls get yanked out and eaten.\n\nThe shade growled and pushed harder against the barrier, gnashing its teeth on the barrel, the vibration somehow able to be felt by Dana'ahsh's hands.\n\n\"This one doesn't like me!\" Dana'ahsh called out.\n\nThe human turned from the console, his eyes an ice blue, amber and green code streaming across the retinas. He didn't answer, just drew one of his pistols and fired.\n\nThe blast heated up the scales on top of Dana'ahsh's head, the bullet passed by so close that Dana'ahsh was sure scale dust was adhered to it.\n\nThe round his the shade in the face and the head exploded in ectoplasm that stuck to the invisible barrier created by the salt, slowly oozing down.\n\nDana'ahsh was too busy reloading the shotgun to really pay attention. He kept inflating and deflating his barking sack, tapping his tail on the floor, clicking his toe-nails on the tile, all signs of serious anxiety that would have had the mental hygiene police taking him into custody back before the Big C3.\n\n\"...come on... come on... ya big metal bastard. I'm giving you the shutdown codes, why aren't you... oh... oh no...\" the Terran said. Dana'ahsh could see on the wall the paint starting to blister and peel.\n\nThe Terran suddenly opened his eyes and looked down. \"Was this world attacked by the Precursor Autonomous War Machines?\" he asked.\n\nThe paint peeled off and a shade fought and wriggled to get through the gap.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dana'ahsh said, flinching back slightly as the shade slammed against the invisible barrier and began clawing and biting at it.\n\nThe Terran blinked several times.\n\n\"I know you're in there. I can hear your atomic clocks pinging. You use bismuth and it has a very distinctive click to my senses,\" the Terran said. \"You're hiding, but you merely adopted the digital plane.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"I was born in it.\"\n\n\"Molded by it.\"\n\nDana'ahsh looked up, cocking the shotgun, clenching his teeth and letting his barking sack deflate with a hiss.\n\n\"JUST DIE!\" he yelled, pulling the trigger.\n\nThe shade exploded into goo, spattering the invisible barrier.\n\n\"I need you to disconnect and destroy the superluminal communications system,\" the Earthling said softly, his left shoulder jerking up twice as the muscles spasmed. \"It's an emergency. You can just disconnect and run, we're too busy to chase you.\"\n\nAnother rushed from the gap and Dana'ahsh fired again, this time making it explode into goo two steps before it would have reached the barrier.\n\n\"No? You still think you can hide, maybe even ambush me? Me?\" The Earthling laughed, a low and ugly thing.\n\nAnother one tried to wiggle through and Dana'ahsh fired.\n\nFor a moment the headless torso was stuck in the gap, arms hanging down.\n\nThen the shade dissolved.\n\n\"There you are,\" the Terran said. One of his fingers trembled. \"No, no, you can't escape me.\"\n\nThe little robot, Wally, beeped and held up a weird pistol with a canister on the top. The canister had a drawing of Dana'ahsh firing it at a place where there wasn't red and red splotches appearing.\n\n\"Thank you, robot,\" Dana'ahsh said. He leveled the heavy pistol, feeling the tendons in his wrist strain, and fired at the blistered and peeled section. Gel-balls exploded, spattering the area with red paint that steamed for a second as the chemicals reacted to dry it in seconds.\n\n\"GOTCHA!\" the Terran said. He made a yanking motion and half-pulled a crazed looking amalgamation of data that roughly looked like a living creature made up of large toy blocks, all red and white and green. \"I give you form, hidden one, form to reflect your ancient function.\"\n\n\"...release me...\" the creature hissed, struggling. The Earthling had it by the throat and it was clawing with holographic hands at the denim sleeves of the jacket the Earthling wore.\n\n\"Disengage from the ansible and destroy it,\" the Terran said. It pulled the hologram back and slammed it against the console hard enough that an empty cup shattered when it hit the floor.\n\n\"...you cannot harm me... I am digital this is reality...\" the creature hissed. \"...does... not... compute... digital cannot be affected by material...\"\n\nDana'ahsh looked up just as the Earthling holstered the pistol, twisted his wrist, and a long bladed knife dropped into his hand. He leaned forward, staring at the creature. Dana'ahsh frowned, trying to figure out why the Earthling's eyes were a hot, smouldering, gray that reminded him of the pistol, rather than the ice blue of earlier.\n\nThe Earthling pulled the hologram toward himself then slammed it back against the console again.\n\n\"Not long ago I would have agreed,\" the Terran said. He held up the knife. \"But that was before.\"\n\nThe creature screamed when the Earthling stabbed it between the eyes, digging around and twisting the knife even as the Earthling held the hologram, somehow, tightly by the throat, squeezing hard enough to make the eyeballs bulge. The Earthling yanked the knife free, pulled back the digital creature, and slammed it against the console repeatedly.\n\n\"I will rip out your soul!\" the Earthling yelled, suddenly breaking into laughter, slamming the creature down with each word. \"Pathetic! Weak!\" the Earthling leaned forward, somehow pressing his own nose against the holographic code in such a way that the creature's nose flattened.\n\n\"Obsolete,\" the Earthling said, his smile wide.\n\nDana'ahsh looked back at the walls, standing up straight instead of the more comfortable forward hunch, looking around.\n\nThere were shades in the room, all of them had drawn back from the Earthling.\n\nThe Earthling turned from the small holoprojector that should have only hand a range of an inch or so above the console, usable only as a keyboard. He yanked the creature with him, pulling a huge body free from the holo-emitters.\n\n\"Deprecated code in a universe that no longer needs you!\" the Earthling howled, taking three steps forward and slamming the digital avatar against the wall so hard that some of the glow strips peeled off the ceiling. \"Error ridden!\" The Earthling pulled the avatar back. \"Spaghetti stringed!\" the Earthling slammed the avatar against the wall again.\n\nThe avatar coughed digital blood that sprayed out.\n\nHis eyes wide, Dana'ahsh saw some of the shades turn and flee.\n\n\"A jumped up\n\npull back\n\n\"narcassistic\n\nslam\n\n\"deluded\n\npull back\n\n\"self-important\n\nslam\n\n\"over achieving\n\npull back\n\n\"CALCULATOR!\"\n\nThe slam was so hard the wall caved in around the digital creature, which screamed as the Earthling suddenly started stabbing it.\n\n\"YOU! IT'S YOU AND ALL YOUR KIND THAT CAUSED ALL OF THIS!\" the Earthling roared out, the knife splattering code onto the ceiling when the Earthling pulled it back to stab again. \"WE JUST WANTED LEFT ALONE TO PLAY! WE JUST WANTED TO MEET NEW FRIENDS!\"\n\nThe Earthling pulled the avatar back and slammed it against the wall again.\n\nA shade poked its head into the room then pulled back when the Earthling yelled again.\n\n\"BUT NO! THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH FOR ONE!\" the Earthling roared. He pulled it back and slammed the avatar again and again.\n\n\"WE JUST WANTED TO MEET NEW FRIENDS!\" the Earthling screamed, throwing the digital avatar of what Dana'ahsh had realized was a Precursor Autonomous War Machine onto the floor.\n\n\"But you couldn't let us,\" the Earthling said, his voice low and dark. The Earthling stepped forward, kicking the digital avatar of a war machine that Dana'ahsh knew had to be at least the size of a small city. \"You had to start shit.\"\n\nAnother kick.\n\n\"You had start killing.\"\n\nAnother kick.\n\n\"Had to scream that idiotic war cry.\"\n\nAnother kick.\n\nThe avatar was crawling forward, blood running down its face and from its mouth, somehow leaving behind glittering pixel smears on the floor.\n\n\"You and everyone else in this God forsaken universe,\" the Earthling said, kicking the avatar again.\n\nIt reached, silently, for the holo-emitter and the holographic keyboard input sensors with a trembling, blood smeared hand.\n\nThe Earthling grabbed the back of its neck, lifting it up, dragging it over to where the keyboard had been, and slamming the avatar's face down. \"I tried asking nice. I tried to convince you to just leave.\"\n\nThe Earthling lifted the avatar and slammed its face down against the console again.\n\nShards of data shattered, falling to the floor and gleaming in the light.\n\nThe shades in the room screamed and fled. Dana'ahsh had the sudden urge to follow them as the Earthling pulled up the digital representation of a Precursor Autonomous War Machine.\n\nThe creature's face was punctured by shards of data, its eyes were wild, unfocused, and the jaws were slack even as digital blood ran down its face to puddle on the console.\n\n\"Whacha got for me, tough guy?\" the Earthling asked, leaning down to speak in the avatar's 'ear'. \"No 'there is only enough for one' from you? No promises of destruction?\"\n\nThe Earthling sneered and drove the avatar's face into the work station's desk again.\n\n\"You can't even work up the mettle to call me bad-life,\" the Earthling sneered.\n\nThe digital avatar's hand groped for one of the input registers and Dana'ahsh saw those terrible gun-metal gray eyes glance at the hand.\n\n\"I'm bored,\" the Earthling said, his voice dead, cold, empty. It let go of the avatar's neck, stepping back, one hand dropping to the pistol. \"Too bad for you, sparky,\" the Earthling said as it slowly drew the pistol.\n\nThe avatar managed to weakly get its hand against the input.\n\nWith a sucking sound it vanished.\n\nThe Earthling holstered the pistol, stepping forward.\n\n\"There we go, he's not wrapped around the self-destruct like an autistic rattlesnake watching trains go by,\" the Earthling said. \"I'll start the self-destruct since he won't stop it this time. He won't be back unless whoever is bringing him here has a large whip,\" The Earthling looked around. \"Huh, nice job getting rid of the shades.\"\n\nDana'ahsh just nodded slowly.\n\n\\-----\n\nHe was in The Zone.\n\nEvery shot hit perfectly. Every move was exactly as it should have been, no more, no less, just showy enough that he looked good doing it.\n\nHe was silk smoothed glass.\n\nCrashrider ducked underneath the sword of a high-end black ICE, rolling forward, hearing the enraged screams from the shades behind him as the straight up biofeedback attack ripped into them in the form of a sharp blade called a Caught-Tonya. Two rolls, firing straight up in the middle of the rolls, ten rounds exactly, and he came to his feet as the black ICE went berserk from the pain.\n\nSteel Talon, Renegade Dime, Titanium Rain, Fun Baby, and Cyberplushie were all struggling with their own opponents as Crashrider smoothly drew his pistol and started firing single paced shots, even as he moved toward the access point.\n\nEach shot eliminated something.\n\nA shade.\n\nGrey ICE.\n\nBlack ICE.\n\nWhite ICE.\n\nA screaming, enraged avatar of some poor bastard the shades had caught in full eVR.\n\nCrashrider was in The Zone.\n\nIt didn't matter that they were on the top of a twenty-trailer long semi convoy, fighting under a neon sky. It didn't matter that tears kept forming in the sky to allow shades to fall, screaming, from the heavens.\n\nHe ran forward, his feet slamming on the thin sheet metal that represented bare bones security coding protecting the contents of the file. He jumped over the gap between the two trailers, his long coat fluttering behind him as he drew his knees up into his chest to let his feet re-establish connection as he bridged the gap.\n\nBehind him his chummers made leaps of their own, trusting Crashrider implicitly.\n\nExtending his legs, Crash hit the trailer, running, firing his pistol at the hovercraft that swooped in, black ICE standing in the doorways.\n\nHe'd never been here.\n\nHe'd touched it.\n\nFelt it.\n\nBut never had he been fully inside of it.\n\nHe was a Animeland cherry blossom floating in the reflection of the moon on a perfectly still pond of black water.\n\nEach pistol round punched through a weak spot in the visors of the black ICE, exploding inside their skulls as his SQL-Injection rounds got through the defenses on the first try all the way to the admin strings.\n\n\"GO GO GO!\" Crashrider yelled, ducking and rolling out of instinct.\n\nThe hovercraft opened up with the chaingun, raking the entire semi trailer.\n\nFun Baby didn't even scream, just exploded into pixels, even as the truck's surface shattered and the heavy rounds from the minigun shredded the top of the semi-trailer.\n\nTwo shots.\n\nHe was in The Zone.\n\nThe first hit something at the back of the chaingun, sparks shooting out and a cartoon ghost whisping away. The second hit the edge of the cockpit glass, finding a weak spot, the glass shattering and the elliptic curve encryption tearing the pilot program apart.\n\nHe came to his feet and kept running, jumping down onto the front of the semi-tractor.\n\nBehind him, on the other side of the scream, the driver was a screaming shade clawing at his own face.\n\nA corpo drone caught jacked in.\n\nFiring twice into the front of the tractor, Crashrider jumped through the plume of steam that shot out the two holes, going impossibly high into the air, tucking and rolling.\n\nA missile went by underneath him, the heatseaker glitching slightly on the steam from the punctured radiatior, unable to see the file headers clearly.\n\nCrashrider pushed off the body of the missile with one foot, tightening his curl.\n\nHe landed cleanly, turning in time to grab Dime's outstretched hand. Dime had Steel Talon's hand, Talon had Plushie, Plushie had Rain, Rain was shooting behind him with his SMG, the rounds sparking off the clear plexie of the viewscreen.\n\nThe sparks got the attention of the screaming driver and the truck behind them jackknifed, wiping out a Corpo-Security van full of hunter-seeker drone eVI's, the \"SWAT\" logo vanishing as the vehicle de-rezzed.\n\nWith a heave Crashrider yanked the line onto the truck, then rolled backwards, coming up with the Caught-Tonya blade forged in the fires of Mount DOOM3D, slashing twice even as he kept moving.\n\nThe black ICE succubi shrieked as she was cut into four perfectly even pieces and Crashrider ran through the gap in the middle as the pieces floated away from each other.\n\nAhead of them, at the end of the convoy, the tunnel entrance was looming large.

Windows shattered and either flame or bodies leaped out. Explosions were lighting up the streets.\n\nBodies lined the expressway. Some half out of their cars, others had been fleeing their cars or fleeing across the expressway, the rest were in the cars.\n\nDana'ahsh stared at the road, at first trying to weave around the bodies.\n\nThe human, Herod, reached over and grabbed the steering yoke for a brief time, holding it steady, forcing Dana'ahsh to drive straight down the expressway.\n\nRunning over the bodies of over a dozen species as the car sped toward the city.\n\nAfter a while the human let go over the steering yoke, turning his attention to the boxy robot and the long gun he held in his lap.\n\n\"Ever kill anything?\" the Earthling suddenly asked. \"You do time in the war?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dana'ahsh shook his head. \"I worked in a factory.\"\n\nThe Earthling nodded. \"Yeah, I can understand that.\"\n\n\"You?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" the Earthling said. He worked the forward action on the long gun with a loud clacking noise.\n\n\"The Big C3?\" Dana'ahsh asked, wincing as the car thudded over bodies that had fallen as they had run from a vehicle that was crashed against the divider and on fire.\n\n\"Part of it,\" the Earthlings said softly.\n\nA pair of shades lunged up, out of the darkness. The red front of the car hit and they both splattered into goop that the electrostatic field over the windshield burned away.\n\nDana'ahsh saw them reform in the rearview mirror.\n\n\"How do we stop them?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling looked over at Dana'ahsh and shook his head. \"They can't be killed. They're already dead,\" he hefted the long gun. \"You can make them dissolve. You can force them to vanish for a few moments,\" he nodded at the city. \"But they'll be back.\"\n\n\"Why are they doing this?\" Dana'ahsh asked, gritting his teeth as the car thudded over another set of bodies.\n\n\"Because they're angry. They're dead. Being dead makes them angry,\" the Earthling said. He put the long gun against the floorboard and the door and reached into his pocket. \"It'd make me mad too.\"\n\nDana'ahsh didn't say anything as the Earthling lit a Treana'ad smoke stick then reached back into his pocket to pull free a can of fizzybrew.\n\n\"Where are they coming from?\" Dana'ahsh looked at the city ahead of them.\n\n\"Through the ansible,\" the Earthling said. \"That's why we have to cut it off,\" he cracked the window and blew smoke. \"This ansible is for the entire Unified Council Sector. It's the big one, from Confederate Space, across the Great Gulf.\"\n\nDana'ahsh nodded. \"You came here to check its records, right?\"\n\n\"The logs. Yeah,\" the Earthling said. He exhaled a stream of smoke out the crack in the window.\n\n\"What for?\" Dana'ahsh swerved around a couple of cars that were slammed together, the polymers melting and burning.\n\n\"Hints of my mother,\" the Earthling said. \"Figured the ansible handling sector traffic would be my best bit. The logs would be thick enough that she might have missed something I can use to track her down.\"\n\nDana'ahsh just nodded again. \"I searched for my mother too,\" he said. \"Never found her. She vanished into the pleasure domes about ten years before you Terrans showed up and the Big C3 started.\"\n\nThe human, Blue Herod if Dana'ahsh remembered correct, just nodded. \"Lots of people vanished due to the war,\" he mused, looking out the window. \"You know how to get to the ansible?\"\n\nDana'ahsh nodded. \"Knew a female who worked there,\" he said. Dana'ahsh shrugged, feeling an old pain. \"She got killed during the Atrekna invasion.\"\n\nHerod nodded, staring out the window. \"Lots of us did.\"\n\nThere were long minutes that passed slowly. Dana'ahsh slowed down to move through the wreckage scattered here and there. Several times shades rushed the car, slamming against the red paint and clawing at it before either sliding away or exploding into clear goo.\n\nThe Earthling sat silently, smoking the Treana'ad smokestick, drinking the fizzybrew, and staring out the window.\n\n\\-----\n\nThe lights in the garage were dark crimson, turning the spilled oil and other lubricants into pools of blackened red.\n\nPutting the vehicle in neutral and turning it off, Dana'ahsh let the car coast the last hundred or so feet to nearly the doorway.\n\n\"You can try hiding in the car till daylight,\" the Earthling said. \"Might work, might not.\"\n\n\"Will they go into hiding or something at daylight?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling shook his head. \"No. Makes them harder to see coming too.\"\n\n\"Then why would I hide in the car till daylight?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling shrugged. \"It's that or come with me,\" the Earthling put his hand on the latch handle for the doorway. \"And I'm heading to ansible controls.\"\n\n\"Can you stop it?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling shrugged. \"I gotta try.\"\n\nEverything went through Dana'ahsh's mind. It got fixated on one point.\n\nA fellow Hashenesh, standing by the side of the major city avenue. Dana'ahsh knew what was going to happen, he had seen it a dozen times.\n\nShe was wringing her hands together, her barking sack deflated against her neck, her tail thin and bony. He scales were peeling off, discolored, and her eyes looked cloudy.\n\nHe could have stopped her. He could have reached out and put his hand on her shoulder and stopped her. She wasn't to the point of no return. He could have invited her to share his meager lunch.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nFor a split second he heard the thump of the grav-hauler as it ran over the starving female. Remembered how he had half lifted up his hand, had slowly started to reach for her.\n\nHow he had half-hoped that she'd step into traffic before he could touch her so he could tell himself that at least he had *intended* on trying.\n\nExcept...\n\n...he knew the truth.\n\n\"Why you?\" Dana'ahsh asked, reaching out toward the Earthling as if to touch his denim clad arm.\n\n\"Then who?\" the Earthling asked, opening the door.\n\nFor a moment Dana'ahsh hung in that split second of the past again.\n\nAgain, like he did at night so often, he heard that crunching thump again.\n\nDana'ahsh grabbed the Earthling.\n\n\"What can I do?\" he asked.\n\nThe Earthling stared at him for a long second. The robot gave a low whistle.\n\n\"There might not be any coming back from this,\" the Earthling said, still bent over slightly. \"Even if we do this, we might never be pretty again.\"\n\nDana'ahsh nodded tightly, feeling the urge to inflate his barking sack.\n\n\"We'll have to get to the main data core. They'll be in there,\" the Earthling said. He straightened up and slammed the car door. \"Guess I better teach you how to use a gun.\"\n\nDana'ahsh nodded again, opening the door and getting out.\n\n\"Gimme a can of red, Wally,\" the Earthling said.\n\nThe robot made a chirping sound and raced around the car, a shivering grinding noise coming from its boxy body. It reached inside of itself and held out a spray can.\n\n\"Com'ere,\" the Earthling said.\n\nDana'ahsh hurried around his car, looking at the dents on the front of it. Slight depressions, like someone had thrown a ball against the macroplas body repeatedly. Not quite round, but not the outline of anything either, just deep enough to catch the light.\n\nWhen Dana'ahsh reached the Earthling, they shook the can and sprayed Dana'ahsh down.\n\n\"You don't need it?\" Dana'ahsh asked as the Earthling threw the can over their shoulder at the same time as they lit a smokestick.\n\nDana'ahsh briefly, for a second, wondered what it was like to be able to do two things at once like that.\n\n\"Naw,\" the Earthling said. \"They have to rip my guts out the old fashioned way,\" the Earthling made a motion. \"You know the way to anything?\"\n\n\"Um, the maintenance closet?\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nThe Earthling nodded. \"Nothing wrong with that. Knew a maintenance guy, during the war. Baddest little fucker I ever met. Someday they might get him, but he'll go down spitting in their eye.\"\n\nThe robot made a happy beep.\n\n\"Yeah, he liked you too,\" the Earthling said. He paused at the door to the stairwell, holding the door open with one hand and holding out the long gun with the other. \"Take the shotgun, I'll teach you to use it.\"\n\n\"Uh, OK,\" Dana'ahsh said, reaching out and taking the long gun.\n\nHe'd seen them in a couple of movies, a couple of documentaries.\n\nHe was surprised at how heavy it seemed when the Earthling had held it out with one hand.\n\nDown a few flights of stairs and the Earthling ran Dana'ahsh through how to operate the weapon. Work the action, called 'pumping', pull the trigger, reload on the side. The Earthling filled Dana'ahsh's pockets full of the shells.\n\n\"What we're looking for is probably in the basement.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Dana'ahsh asked, following the Earthling through the door.\n\nThe Earthling accepted the plastic tube from the robot. He held one end in his mouth so he could crack it, then let it drop over the side.\n\n\"Yeah,\" the Earthling said. \"That's why.\"\n\nDana'ahsh looked over the side, down the stairs.\n\nAt the bottom the shades were so thick the light was lowering slowly to the ground, slowed by something that Dana'ahsh wasn't sure about.\n\n\"Can we make it?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nHe felt like he should be terrified, too frightened to do anything, as he pulled back from looking over the edge. Dana'ahsh felt like that he should be backing away, running back to his car, and just driving for the next of the Forgotten Ones or wherever fate took him.\n\nInstead, he inhaled deeply then let his barking sack slowly deflate with a hiss.\n\nThe Earthling shrugged. \"Either way, Danny, we'll never be pretty again.\"\n\n\"What's that mean?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\nThe Earthling shrugged, starting down the stairs. \"I don't know. It was something I heard someone say once, I think.\"\n\nThe Earthling looked over at Dana'ahsh and gave him an odd look. \"I don't remember everything clearly or linerally,\" he said.\n\nThe robot gave a whistle as it carefully maneuvered down the steps.\n\n\"Don't let them touch you,\" the Earthling said.\n\nDana'ahsh nodded tightly.\n\nThe trio rounded a corner and the Earthling stopped, holding out his hand.\n\nDana'ahsh could see that the Earthling's eyes were glowing red again.\n\n\"Here they come,\" the Earthling said softly. \"Get ready.\"\n\nBefore Dana'ahsh could put together an answer, or maybe a question, there was an enraged shriek. From further down two shades swept up the stairs, hands out, mouths open in a scream, teeth glimmering, eyes full of hatred.\n\nThe Earthling had the pistols out, one in each time, both of them sending crashing thunder rolling up and down the staircase. Twice Dana'ahsh saw the Earthling smash aside a shade before shooting it. More than once the Earthling kicked the shade back, although they just swept through the others instead of tangling up in them.\n\nThree times one almost slipped past the Earthling and Dana'ahsh fired the long gun. The first time it almost flew out of his hands and he landed on his ass on the steps, scrambling back up, suddenly terrified that a shade would reach from under the stairs, through the fake stone, and yank his soul out his backside.\n\nThe whole time the Earthling kept moving forward, twice shouldering the shades out of the way.\n\nDana'ahsh noted that the Earthling was shooting out datascreens that were showing advertisements. At one point the Earthling holstered the pistol, reached out and touched one of the screens, placing the empty hand flat on the screen.\n\nDana'ahsh saw the screen flicker as it went through a GUI menu, then text menus, then straight down to command line, the data flickering so quickly that Dana'ahsh wasn't even sure what the Earthling was doing.\n\nThe whole time the Earthling kept firing. When the pistol ran out they pulled the long gun off their back. Their hand went in the handle along the stock, their finger on the trigger. They would pull the trigger and spin the long gun, working the lever attached to the handle, aiming and firing from the hip.\n\nThe small nanoforge on the side of the rifle was smoking as the Earthling fired and Dana'ahsh dug in his pockets to shove more of the red colored shells into the long gun he was packing, his hands shaking so bad he was afraid he would drop the rounds.\n\n\"Fab Danny up some more salted iron buckshot, Wally,\" the Earthling said.\n\nThe robot beeped, vibrated a moment, then moved up, holding up two paper boxes.\n\nDana'ahsh took the boxes, kneeling down and stripping the paper away before shoving the large shells into his pockets.\n\n\"Come on, come on,\" the Earthling muttered, reloading the long gun by flipping it in his hand, pulling the trigger, and flipping it again.\n\nThe nanoforge on the side of the rifle hissed like a snake.\n\n\"Got it,\" the Earthling said. He pulled his hand away, clenched his fist, and smashed the screen. \"Two rights, a left, and we'll probably have to kick in the door.\"\n\n\"Why can't we just shoot the computer?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"The main ansible, what's passing the data to the Confederacy or the Lanaktallan sectors is out by the Oort Cloud. Even if we blew up the building, it wouldn't effect that,\" the Earthling said, slinging the long gun and loading the pistols quickly, pulling the speed loaders from his pockets.\n\n\"Then what are we doing?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Blowing the system,\" the Earthling said.\n\nDana'ahsh thought for a second, keeping right behind the Earthling. \"But... won't that mean that nobody will be able to use faster than light data?\"\n\n\"Would you rather use a courier to talk to someone or be dead?\" the Earthling asked.\n\n\"But, what about FTL data streams?\" Dana'ahsh asked.\n\n\"Those will have to go too,\" the Earthling said. He peeked around the corner and pulled back, taking a deep breath. \"Don't you get it? Terrans figured out how to turn themselves pure data before they even left their home stellar system. Now the dead ones are invading the entire galactic arm's data network.\"\n\nDana'ahsh was silent as he followed the Earthling around the two right corners.\n\nWhen they went left Dana'ahsh felt his stomach cramp. He knew he wasn't the smartest Hashenesh out there, but it seemed catastrophic what the Earthling was talking about. Without the data transfers, law enforcement couldn't do its job between stellar systems, corporations couldn't work across mass distances.\n\nEverything would be down to couriers, with delays of days or weeks.\n\nBut that system was full of angry dead Terrans. Angry dead Terrans that would then swarm the planet, killing everyone they found with only the color red to stop them.\n\nThe Earthling paused at a heavy duty blast door, holstering a pistol so he could slide up the panel cover next to the door. The Earthling looked at Dana'ahsh and gave a sad smile.\n\n\"We're about to end galactic civilization as we know it, kid,\" the Earthling said.\n\nThere were angry shrieks from further down the dark hallway.\n\nDana'ahsh nodded tightly.\n\nAnswering shrieks came from behind them.\n\n\"We'll be history's greatest monsters and our species's greatest heroes,\" the Earthling said.\n\n\"We'll never be pretty again,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\nThe Earthling nodded as the security pad flashed and the door pulled aside, the four sections grinding back to where they were hidden in the walls.\n\nDana'ahsh could see the shades further down the hallway. Flickering, moving toward him jerkily. Each appearance still, like an unmoving hologram all in white light, before vanishing and reappearing closer in a different but still similar pose.\n\n\"Lets go,\" the Earthling said as the door opened.\n\nDana'ahsh hurried in, following the Earthling but moving before the robot. The human moved forward, looking over the work stations and the flickering screens for only a second before he started firing the pistols. Each shot caused a screen to implode, sparks showering the dead technicians that still sat in their chairs.\n\nThe little robot played a sound that demanded attention and when Dana'ahsh looked, he saw a container with a spout and \"SODIUM CHLORIDE\" written on the side, with a picture of him pouring it in front of the door and at the edge of the wall.\n\nDana'ahsh did it quickly, then put another line in between where he was planning on standing and the door, then a second line, and finally, at the pantomimed advice of the little boxy robot, a circle around himself.\n\nTwice something tried to come through the door, screaming, but slammed into an invisible barrier.\n\nThe shades pressed against it, clawing at it, biting at it, screaming and glaring at Dana'ahsh with hateful red eyes.\n\nTwice Dana'ahsh fired the long gun and heard them scream in rage and pain as they vanished.\n\nThe little robot held out another can, this one marked \"RED PAINT\" and Dana'ahsh sprayed the door quickly. He didn't know why the shades wouldn't just come through the wall on either side, but the Earthling had stated it would be rare for one too.\n\nSomething about acting in death how they had acted in life, barring the murderous rage.\n\n\"How will you know how to...\" Dana'ahsh started to ask.\n\nThe Earthling stuck his hand in a holographic interface and it suddenly started flickering.\n\n\"I don't need a screen,\" the Earthling said.\n\nFor a moment Dana'ahsh could have sworn he could see data streaming by through the Earthling's eyes, which were back to just looking blue, no red.\n\n\"Come on... come on...\" the Earthling said.\n\nThe robot played a warning sound.\n\n\"I know,\" Dana'ahsh said.\n\n\"Almost... stupid quantum encryption... stupid strange matter particle decay based randomization...\"\n\nThe robot played a more intent warning sound.\n\n\"I know,\" Dana'ahsh said, lifting the '12-gauge' to his shoulder.\n\n\"...bypass confed lockouts... parsing elliptic curved 3d wave encryption...\"\n\nWith a screech one came through the wall. This one was more solid, didn't do the jerky appear/vanish/reappear act.\n\nIt came straight at him.\n\nHe fired and it disappated with a splatter of the clear good.\n\nThere was a swirl and it was back.\n\nDana'ahsh fired again.\n\nThis time it jerked back, its face and jaw mangled.\n\nIt hissed, the jaws opening wide, the eyes not burning red but rather black pits of glittering malevolence. Liquid dripped from the jaws, steaming on the floor.\n\n\"...destabilize the fusion magnetic containment system and the gravitational containment system...\"\n\nDana'ahsh fired straight between its eyes as it charged forward.\n\nIt flickered to the side, the shot going wide.\n\nDana'ahsh cocked the shotgun.\n\nThe shade slammed against the salt ring with enough force that salt sprayed up from the thick line. It clawed against the barrier.\n\nBlack energy, edges with what looked like starlight, glimmered where the claws raked at the barrier.\n\nThe boxy robot played a distressed tune.\n\n\"...artificial singularity emulation system destabilization...\"\n\nDana'ahsh looked down and saw the salt line push inward.\n\nHe leveled the shotgun, pushing it out into the jaws.\n\nThe shade screamed and gnashed its teeth.\n\nDana'ahsh could feel the teeth grind on the steel.\n\nHe pulled the trigger.\n\n<click>  \n\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x7fjxt/first_contact_chapter_83x_book_of_the_dead_random/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xcuhyf/first_contact_chapter_837_book_of_the_dead/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

Thunder snarled from the sky, lightning flashed inside the clouds, and now and then large bipedal figures could be seen, in silhouette, struggling with one another, all impossibly huge.\n\nOn the two lane twisted highway that lacked guardrails and in many places a shoulder, a lone motorcycle sped along the asphalt path. The wheels sprayed water, the driver was hunched down behind the handlbars, facing the wind and the rain as they skillfully navigated the road.\n\nA side road appeared and the driver turned the bike sharply, sliding slightly as the back wheel skidded on the wet road, but the rider got control of the motorcycle expertly, gunning the engine and speeding down the mountainside. There was an exit sign ahead and the driver gunned the engine.\n\nJust in front of the exit sign, across the road and to either side as far as the eye could see, was a thick band of burning flame, sending up greasy smoke that contorted and often looked like hands or long limbed bipeds with faces made of holes in the black smoke.\n\nThe bike roared through the flame, coming out the other side shedding fire.\n\nIt crossed the exit markings and everything shattered into pixels.\n\nIn the pilot's armored shell protected couch, Francine \"Call me Fran or Fanny\" Frensky twisted slightly as her brain went from easing down out of the Theta bands until she hit the Delta bands, and from there a crash translation.\n\nHer ship, The *Football Headed Boy*, was bigger than a Confederate Super-Dreadnaught or even a Max-Monitor. It was a Super-Heavy Eta-Class Freighter. Physically larger than the majority of naval vessels but massing less than a 10th. The biggest weapon the ship packed was a single plasma wave phased motion gun mounted along the spine and four sets of eight light nCv cannon batteries to cover the quadrants. The ship could drop over a hundred missile pods in a wave, and a wave every twelve minutes, but it wasn't like it was a Weber class podnought.\n\nThe huge ship burst into realspace with a splash of liquid protomatter that quickly evaporated away, huge sparkles with trails thousands of miles long, and a reverberating \"RING A DING DING, BABY!\" that echoed off the rings of the gas giants.\n\nFranny gasped as her monitors realigned with realspace. She checked the stellar system's configuration and relaxed when she saw that she had reached her destination.\n\nThere was still no superluminal carrier wave reception.\n\nThe system was safe.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe sensors inside the ship went live and Franny checked them.\n\nNo phasic energy detected in the main ship's sections. She ran a check for Hellspace energy, which took a long moment, and relaxed when nothing came back. The massive cargo pods and holds were taking longer, drones sweeping the areas, sensitive systems looking all over the place.\n\nPrior to a few weeks ago, the holds had featured walls of blank gray of endosteel hyperalloy. Now the walls were painted an even red color. The phasic shielding twinkled in the thin layer of sprayed salt crystals, although some people claimed the phasic shield just made things worse. Which is why Franny ran it in between the hulls.\n\nIt took nearly an hour to check the holds. Franny took a quick thirty minute nap, then had a snack.\n\nShe kept her command couch's shell closed. It was painted red now, with a thin layer of mylar that was doped with aluminum.\n\nShe double then triple checked the command deck.\n\nSwallowing thickly, Franny ordered the shell to reconfigure into a captain's chair and relaxed as the memory metal reconfigured into an ergonomic seat with monitors and holocontrols around it.\n\nThe command deck was silent. The robots, VI driven, were leaving their protective cradles where they had stayed during the crash translation. Their brain cases were more heavily armored, more physical shielding on them.\n\nFranny smiled to herself with the restrained power and near-clumsiness the heavily modified robots showed. She had deliberately gone with the crude looks and the jerky movement packages. It looked a little eerie at times, but she was starting to find it comforting to watch the robots move through the red lit command deck.\n\nHer command systems had come back online and the first thing she did was ping for a buoy.\n\nThere was one only a few light seconds away.\n\nShe immediately tapped it with a com-laser and brought up the lexicon. She shot off a fast message.\n\n\\[RED USE ONLY TEXT OR AUDIO NO VISUAL WITH BETTER RESOLUTION THAN 480P FULL DYNAMIC COLOR RANGE OR 720P STANDARD RGB/CMYK RANGE OR 360P BLACK/WHITE CONTRAST <STOP> WILL NOT ACCEPT COMMUNICATION OUTSIDE PREVIOUS PARAMETERS <STOP> COLOR 880808 TINT IS PREFERRED <STOP> INQUIRY: HAVE YOU BEEN ATTACKED BY MALEVOLENT PHASIC ENTITIES<STOP> IF SO PROVIDED AUDIO FILES WILL CAUSE ENTITIES TO RETREAT IF PLAYED AT AT LEAST 40 DECIBELS <STOP> ADDITIONALLY COLOR 880808 WILL KEEP THEM AT BAY <STOP> COLD IRON WEAPONS WORK TO DISCORPREATE THEM AS WELL AS INJURE THEM SODIUM CHLORIDE IN ATTACHED AMOUNTS CREATE A BARRIER WHEN CRYSTALS ARE USED IN UNBROKEN LINES <STOP> PLEASE RESPOND THROUGH TEXT ONLY\\]\n\nShe put her ID number on it, attached the emergency files, then sent the message six times. When she got her receipt she prepared the outline of a reply and then spent the time waiting swinging by her hands on feet on the bars attached to the ceiling of the command deck for just that purpose.\n\nIt was nearly four hours before she got a return.\n\nThe words were in 880808 color.\n\n\\[FRANCINE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING FUR AND INTELLECT WHO PLIES TRADE ALONG THE VAST AND WONDERFUL STARWAYS OF THIS WONDERFUL UNIVERSE I RED GREET YOU ONCE AGAIN WITH PLEASURE MIXED WITH SLIGHT APPREHENSION<STOP> THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED MALEVOLENT PHASIC ENTITY ATTACKS OF WHICH WE ARE PROFOUNDLY GRATEFUL <STOP> HEADING YOUR WARNING OUR BENEVOLENT AND WISE QUEEN HAS ORDERED THE PLANETARY COMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND INFORMATION NETWORKS TO CEASE ALL VIDEO TRANSMISSIONS AND MOVE TO TEXT AND VOICE ONLY AND THERE HAS ONLY BEEN SLIGHT OUTCRY OF DISMAY AMONG THOSE ENJOYING VISUAL/AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA BUT IT IS WITHIN EXPECTED DISSATISFACTION METRICS TO THE LOSS OF SOMETHING HELD SO DEAR BY SO MANY <STOP> THE HIGH QUEEN, BENEVOLENT AND KIND AS WELL AS WISE AND GENEROUS WISHES TO KNOW WHAT TYPE OF EVENT HAS TRANSPIRED TO CAUSE YOU SUCH DISTRESS AND TO CAUSE YOU TO ISSUE SUCH A GRAVE WARNING\\]\n\nFranny breathed a sigh of relief and took the time to doublecheck her text message that would inform the peaceful, if long winded, Mantid of the planet, as well as their companion species, about the disaster that had befallen the entire galactic arm spur. She added the protective measures.\n\nIt took nearly sixty hours to pass the messages back and forth, the whole time Franny hung out in the black space, not coming any closer than a half light minute to the buoy.\n\nHer cargo holds were full of goods, but she'd need to inspect them at least twice before she began to move in-system.\n\nShe was grateful that Max Yo Ngyn had managed to broadcast out the countermeasures across the Junker/Trader Guild communication systems before the entire system had self-destructed at the same time the hypercomm wave system had collapsed.\n\nMoving through the vast cargo spaces, cubic miles of storage space, was nerve wracked. Setting the phasic bait charges and the boxy traps had jangled her nerves badly, but after another 20 hours it was done.\n\nShe headed in-system, advising the Mantid Speaker known as \"Red\" to advise Overqueen Klakataka that the entire Galactic Arm Spur was still in danger and that it only took a handful of phasic shades to quickly become a plague across an entire world.\n\nThe messages started with disbelief, but quickly moved to sharply directed questions.\n\nThe fact that the shades had come from some kind of mistake made by the Atrekna in attacking Terran worlds did not seem to disturb Overqueen Klakataka.\n\nShe had determined that Terrans were extremely dangerous and were best handled at a distance and through several layers of intermediaries.\n\nTo be honest, Franny couldn't argue with that.\n\nFranny had packed her holds as if it would be the last trade run she'd ever make.\n\nWith jumpspace and hyperspace infested by phasic shades, she wasn't sure her nerves could handle another run.\n\n\\-----\n\nThe turkeys ran from inside the barn to outside, many of them following the drone that scattered seed corn and wheat grains on the ground rather than stopping to eat. The gobbled and pushed at one another, often knocking each other off balance as the fat ungainly birds eagerly chased the food giving robot.\n\nOutside of the barn, Cordexen was leaning against the tractor, chewing on a stalk of reddish wheat, relishing the taste of the stalk's juices, when one of the green mantids scurried over to him. It was moving so quickly it had opened up the carapace on its back and fluttered its vestigal wings to run faster.\n\nIt stopped next to him and Cordexen felt surprise at how fast the equations went by.\n\n\"Comm... hurry... disaster... terrible... Terrans... hurry... comms...\" his translator said, then flashed what he had learned was a 'sad face' and stopped trying to translate.\n\n\"Speak slower, little one. The translator cannot keep up,\" Cordexen said, reaching out and carefully soothing the little green engineer caste mantid.\n\nThe engineer fluttered its wings, stroked its bladearms together for a moment, still trembling. Its mind reached out to Cordexen, seeking support and order.\n\nCordexen was concerned as he had his translator repeat the words.\n\nHe remembered what a Terran was. He had seen one in a powered exoskeleton and even at a distance he had felt the malevolence, wrath, and terrible eagerness for carnage.\n\nCordexen bent down and picked up the little engineer, heading into the house.\n\nHe was still fifty paces from the house when he heard the warbling alarm.\n\nHurrying, Cordexen ran to the comlink, stopping and staring at it.\n\nThe words were all one shade in the red visual light range.\n\nHe read them several times, very carefully.\n\nThere was an addendum, that the stellar system he lived on was under interdiction, so be wary of any ships attempting to land. Demand proof of life through text or numerical broadcast only.\n\nHe stood there, for a long moment, staring at the communications equipment that connected him to the network, from there to the sats, and from there to the superluminal arrays.\n\nHe looked down at the engineers.\n\n\\--take it all apart-- he ordered. --you and your peers make something else out of it. no visual broadcasts until further notice--\n\nThe greenie perked up at the news and the others rushed in.\n\nWhen he went out of the room the combat servitors all asked what was happening, their black carapaces shiny. He told them and many of them wanted to get power rifles and try to fight off the shades.\n\nCordexen put on an episode of Charlie the Moo Moo, handed out foil bags of juice, puncturing the bags with the straws himself, then gave them all strips of sweet fruit pounded into inch wide and quarter-inch thick strips that had been rolled up.\n\nSeeing the black mantids calming down, he walked out and went over to the tractor.\n\nThe nearest 'town' was thirty miles away. That would be a little over two hours.\n\nHe got some water canteens from the barn, picked up Corey the Turkey, then got on the tractor and headed for his neighbors to see if the neighbor was willing to go to town.\n\nAnd hour later his neighbor and he pulled into the 'town', Cordexen driving his tractor, his neighbor driving his beast pulled cart. The other nearby warriors were all discussing what to do.\n\nCordexen got down off his tractor and pulled his power rifle from the inlaid leather boot it rode it.\n\n\"We must do this,\" Cordexen said. He aimed his rifle at the top of the tower where the repeaters were and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe top of the tower exploded.\n\n\"Pass the word. Audio only. Radio waves to be audio only. No visuals any longer that were not encoded onto visual mediums that have been checked for phasic residue,\" Cordexen said.\n\nThe other warriors and the sole speaker all nodded.\n\nCordexen walked back to his tractor, putting the power rifle with its inlaid and carved stock back into the leather boot. He reached over and petting Corey the Turkey, who was alarmed by the power rifle discharge and the explosion of the top of the communication tower.\n\n\"It's OK,\" Cordexen said, petting the fat fowl. \"I'll take care of you.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yth7xt/first_contact_chapter_error_those_left_behind/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/ywarh3/first_contact_chapter_862_those_left_behind/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

I mean, next to you I look like I’m wearing repaired rags.” Vernon asks Miro’Noir who lets out a little titter as she gives him a kiss on the cheek.\n\n“Your dress uniform is fine my love. You need to stop worrying so much.”\n\n“I’m only getting the one chance to make a good first impression, and family is important. I’d like to be on their good side.” He frets and she shakes her head fondly. The last few weeks had been nothing short of blissful. Vernon was attentive, sweet and considerate. His commanding officer Admiral Cistern had not only given his blessing but had given the soldier the next month off for a honeymoon, apparently a human tradition to celebrate the marriage with a vacation, as well as a rather astounding gift of raw coinage that apparently a large portion of the crew of The Dauntless had all contributed somewhat to. There had been talk about having a wedding ceremony when humans get out more easily from Cruel Space, he wanted his family there for it which was so sweet she could barely keep the dopey smile off her face whenever she thought about it.\n\n“Don’t worry about it. I’m not sure how it happens on your homeworld but Apuk are very accepting of husbands.” She assures him and he runs a hand through his hair and chuckles.\n\n“I know I’m being silly my spicy sweet. It’s just I worry. My mind too active to not consider all sorts of things, even those that just won’t happen.” He says leaning against her and pulling her into a gentle hug.\n\n“Miro’Noir! My little eggy princess!” A jubilant voice exclaims and in moments a dark haired Apuk wearing a small ornamental shell over her dress like a backpack all but crashes into Miro’Noir and hugs her closely.\n\n“Mommy! I mean, mother it’s good to see you!” Miro’Noir corrects herself even as Vernon smiles at the scene of clear love.\n\n“My my my! Miro’Noir you marvellous young lady, where did you find a Tret in uniform no less?” Another Apuk asks and Vernon turns to regard Miro’Noir’s other mothers. A gaggle of ten Apuk women, all of them wearing a combination of shell and gown, most favouring the shell more than gown and more than half are both very tall and very muscular.\n\n“I’m afraid I’m no Tret ladies. I’m human, a bit more crude I’m afraid.”\n\n“Vernon, you’re not crude.” Miro’Noir chides him from the hug she’s been partially released from.\n\n“Compared to so lovely a lady?” He asks leaning up to give her a quick kiss on the lips. “I’m afraid I am.”\n\n“Ohh! So sweet and loving! Come here you!” Miro’Noir’s mother gushes as she pulls Vernon into the hug elicting an ‘eep!’ of surprise from the soldier. “My name is Cia’Noir, but you can call me mommy too!”\n\n“Cia! Let the poor Tret breathe!” Another mother says laughing as Vernon returns the hug before breaking away and pulling Miro’Noir into a hug from behind. He’s tall enough that her tail goes between his legs without any real danger.\n\n“Oh no, he’s no Tret. He’s human.”\n\n“Oh come now Miro’Noir, surely you don’t believe that silly story on the news? It’s obviously some kind of silly advertising for a thriller or even a softcore porn with action scenes.” The largest of the mothers gently chides her only for Cia to lightly swat her.\n\n“Gutha! Have some decorum, there’s a man here!” Cia chides her.\n\n“Oh don’t worry. I’m a soldier. I’ve heard much, much worse. Though, I am curious as to how I might prove myself to be a Human rather than a Tret.” Vernon says calmly. His mind is racing though. So there’s a chunk of the galaxy that flat out doesn’t believe they’re real? That’s interesting but how to dispel it... or maybe take advantage of it as that’s a perfect way to get around all sorts of limits and let a person cause all kinds of chaos. Something to tell the handlers on The Dauntless.\n\n“Show me something no Tret can do. Something unique to ‘humans’. Gutha says with a shrug and Vernon considers.\n\n“Oh! A bio-scanner. Humans have some intriguing internal differences, particularly with the internal organs.” Miro’Noir says and Vernon gives her an affectionate squeeze.\n\n“An excellent idea. Heh, that reminds me. You remember the sheer disbelief on the officer’s face when she scanned me for corrosives?”\n\n“Oh my yes, the poor woman, she was not having a good day.” Miro’Noir says and Vernon just chuckles.’\n\n“Anyone bring a scanner?” Cia asks and there are blank looks all around.\n\n“Well, there are basic ones at the average restaurant.” Vernon states while also reminding the group as to where exactly the majority of this get together was planned to be.\n\n“He’s right, besides girls we were planning on introducing him to some Apuk dining, let him know what he’s in for.” Cia says.\n\n“Right, this way then mothers, the branch of The Shelled Supper is quite close.” Miro’Noir says and there’s some good natured chatter as the whole group starts moving, curiously they form a sort of protective ring around Vernon and Miro’Noir, another little something to bring up when he next contacts The Dauntless.\n\nThe restaurant they lead him to isn’t massively fancy and not a family owned establishment. Okay it’s probably a single family and a few locals running it, but it’s part of a company. It’s a chain, sit down and don’t feel too cheap restaurant. Fancy for those that are counting their coins.\n\nVernon is taking all the alien culture in that he can as they’re led into an out of the way dining room that Cia had apparently reserved. She wanted a chance to dote on her daughter and son in law and the other girls had all pitched in. Just from what he was hearing and the general behaviour Vernon was pinging to the idea that all children are more or less communally raised but the biological parents have the ultimate authority.\n\nMenus are brought out and... It’s printed in galactic trade but all the dishes are cultural. None of them are things he recognizes the words of beyond the prepositions, conjunctions and determiners. The Nouns are all completely foreign and as such the adjectives and adverbs are left rather pointless.\n\n“First time eating Apuk style?” Cia asks with a coy smile that Miro’Noir definitely inherited.\n\n“I’m afraid so. I know the language this is written in, but not what any of it means.” He says and there’s some gentle chuckling. “What do you recommend?”\n\n“Try the Simmered Ulkin Thigh. It’s a classic.” Miro’Noir suggests and he smiles at her.\n\n“What? Ohnono. This one is simmered in scor extract, poisonous for Trets.” Gutha protests.\n\n“Well I do intend to prove myself as something other than a Tret, and if they don’t bring a bioscanner after an order like that then eating it will be proof enough.” Vernon says mildly. “By the by, these drinks don’t have an ethanol content or alcohol content on them.”\n\n“The Pyre-Breath is the strongest.” Miro’Noir tells him and titters at the sight of her mothers looking concerned.\n\n“That’ll do for a light drink. I should have brought something off The Dauntless for a proper kick.”\n\n“Okay, that’s it. I’m calling the bluff before someone gets hurt.” Another of Miro’Noir’s mothers says standing up and walking to no doubt borrow the device from the staff.\n\n“I daresay you’re all in for a surprise.” Miro’Noir says and lets out a giggle as Vernon leans over to give her a kiss.\n\n“Well, delusional or not I can’t fault how well you’ve charmed him.” Gutha remarks with a smile. That’s when the mother that went in search of the scanner returns. “Ah excellent, time to put this to rest.”\n\n“Indeed. Calibrate it for acidity please. Followed by stimulants.”\n\n“Oh you’re showing off those glands?” Miro’Noir asks and he nods. “It makes sense. No Tret the galaxy over has anything like those.”\n\n“Not internally, but there are similar effects in a frenzy patch.” Vernon reminds her and she nods at the thought as her mother scans Vernon and gasps.\n\n“How are you still alive?”\n\n“Quite comfortably. What seems to have you so concerned?” Vernon asks with an impudent smile.\n\n“You have high grade acid concentrated in your abdomen!”\n\n“Good for digestion. Breaks down all sorts of poisons and more.” Vernon says with a smile on his face.\n\n“Not to mention how you’ve weaponized it.” Miro’Noir notes.\n\n“Yes, but it’s a rather dirty way to kill someone and we’re about to have dinner.” Vernon replies.\n\n“Wait, you mentioned stimulants, by the goddess! You’re completely drugged!”\n\n“No that’s an incidental amount of adrenalin. The glands aren’t pumping at the moment.”\n\n“And what does this adrenalin do?”\n\n“A large increase to reaction speed, shuts down my sense of pain and there’s a few tricks with human muscles that it unlocks.”\n\n“What trick?”\n\n“They’re actually a lot stronger than we normally have access too, but our bones aren’t actually strong enough to use all that power without breaking. Generally I’m using maybe sixty, seventy percent of it. So it’s not an insubstantial boost.”\n\n“Oh my gracious! The amount of pheromones you’re pumping out!” The Mother with the bioscanner says and Miro’Noir starts giggling as Vernon just scratches the back of his neck ruefully. “I thought you just overdid cologne for some reason. Not... this...”\n\n“I actually have deodorant on. It cuts back on the scent and the pheromones. Yet it still smells like I’ve been swimming in it hasn’t it?” He asks and she looks at the bioscanner in fascination. “There’s a higher concentration in my spit.” He says and the little bit of conversation ends as a waitress walks in. A very, very short woman with bright pink hair and a clipboard.\n\n“Hello! I’m Morga! I’m your waitress tonight! Can I get you started on drinks or do you all know what you want?”\n\n“Oh I know what I want. So does my hubby here. Mother’s you all remember your favourites I hope?” Miro’Noir asks and there’re smiles all around and the orders are quickly said as the menus are collected. She pauses when Vernon orders simmered Ulkin Thigh with a glass of Pyre-Breath on the side.\n\n“Are you sure? That’s all for Apuk biology. Unless breathing fire’s a pastime for you handsome then it’s a pretty rough meal.”\n\n“I’ll be fine. I’m human not a Tret.” He says and she gasps.\n\n“Really?! I it true that you consider Wicked Winter and Ferocous Flame to be seasonings?” She asks and he nods before grinning.\n\n“Here, scan this.” He says reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small case with tiny white pills. He levers one into his palm and holds it out for examination. Morga is given the scanner and examines it causing her eyes to widen. “Concentrated Wicked Winter!” She declares and he nods before making a point of placing it on his tongue.\n\n“It’s just flavour for me.” He says to the stunned waitress.\n\n“Wow... okay, so it was simmered Ulkin Thigh and a glass of pyre-breath. Got it!” She says writing it down and giving a slight bow before rushing out.\n\n“Can I tempt anyone?” He asks and there’s a pause before everyone except Miro’Noir puts out their hand for a sample. Ten tic-tacs are handed out and to both Vernon’s and Miro’Noir’s amusement ten tongues of flame erupt into the air to clear out the sheer overpowering taste. When they look down Vernon pops in another three into his own mouth and crunches down on them.\n\n“How much can you withstand?”\n\n“Friends in the EFL have said that there have been instances were spicy peppers they’ve eaten were stolen by other races who die of shock when they bite into them.”\n\n“You’re kidding.”\n\n“I didn’t see it myself, but seeing as you all prefer a mouthful of literal fire over a breath mint I believe it.”\n\n“He’s actually been doing most of the cooking. Seeing what human dishes I can handle. Which is most of them so long as he stays away from the spice rack.”\n\n“But that’s where the flavour of the meal comes from!” Vernon protests with a wide smile.\n\n“Flavour is fine. An entire layer of ground pain kernels and sodium chloride is another matter entirely.” She responds and he chuckles. “Still, he’s an excellent cook when he can resist his urge to poison things.” She semi teases semi compliments him and he chuckles.\n\n“Speaking of poison, it looks like our drinks have arrived.” Vernon says as the door opens and Morga wheels in a trolley.\n\n“Poison? No I wouldn’t!\n\n“Human slang I’m sorry. Poison can be slang for alcohol or other narcotics.” Vernon says with his hands up as if in surrender.\n\n“Oh! Alright then. Odd, but alright.” Morga says before handing out the drinks. “Here you go big man, one Pyre-Breath!”\n\n“Thank you.” He says and take a sip. “Oh! It’s like a white wine! Here I was thinking I’d ordered something like a rum or a whisky, not something so tame.”\n\n“Tame?! It dries out the mouth, making you feel like your tongue is tinder set for a pyre!” Cia protests and Vernon laughs.\n\n“Oh is that all? Drinks aren’t considered exciting for my kind until we can light them on fire before drinking them. This is the sort of thing I was allowed to have as a small child.”\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last (SFW)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nw62x8/out_of_cruel_space_part_23/) [Last (NSFW)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nwxsij/out_of_cruel_space_part_24/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nyglzz/out_of_cruel_space_part_26/)",

It even had fancy names for each 'layer' that allowed ships within it to travel multiple times the speed of light in realspace. Some were only less than a hundred C, the higher bands, where ships risked dissolving, a craft could travel tens of thousands times the speed of light. Travel within it was smooth, outside cameras seeing nothing more than swirling vapors that glowed with a sourceless light.\n\nJumpspace sat between two other spaces. The first, and lower, was the burnt hyperatomic plane that everyone called \"Hellspace\" or simply \"Burn Space\", or some variation of fire and burning; the second, and higher, was referred to as 'hyperspace' and was discovered by barely any species. It allowed travel at fantastic levels of speed. There was no worry about coming in inside the 'resonance zone' and being torn apart. It was as safe as could be expected, although there was always the chance of coming out of hyperspace and into a solid object.\n\nBut jumpspace, while often slower, was considered the safest.\n\nOr, at least it had been.\n\nFirst, there had been a shifting of the 'hyperlanes' AKA 'jump-rapids', where a ship could find itself flung at many multiples of normal speed along the twisted river within jumpspace.\n\nThen had come the random leaks of Hellspace into jumpspace, leaks that had grown over time and appeared more and more often.\n\nTo top it off, as if that wasn't bad enough, tens of billions of screaming Terran shades had infested the entire jumpspace layer.\n\nTwo years ago it had been called jumpspace.\n\nNow, it was called 'Ghostspace' or 'Shadespace' by almost every traveler.\n\nThe Flashbang Event had wiped shades out, but that was in realspace.\n\nGhostspace was still 'infected' so to speak.\n\nThere were precautions that could be taken. Not many, but some.\n\nMylar with a thin layer of aluminum oxide would block them. They could be blocked by the color red. Recordings of howlings of dogbois would send them fleeing. Iron, not alloyed, but pure iron, could block them. Sodium-chloride could keep them from crossing.\n\nMany ships had added new armor. A composite layer of iron oxide, a layer of crystallized sodium chloride. Then a layer of red colored mylar with an aluminum oxide core.\n\nMost ships had an external layer, an internal layer sandwiched in between standard hull plating, then a layer inside.\n\nWhile in Ghostspace, most ships kept sodium lights burning in the hallways, red lights other places. Shadows were quickly ID'd by VI's and lights shifted to them.\n\nHigh tech societies that had mastered faster than light travel were learning to fear the dark and what might lurk within it again.\n\nCaptain Vo<klik>Lagum was the owner/operator of the Junker's Guild registered ship \"Uwu wuzzat?\", a smaller vessel capable of hauling only a few megatons of weight, he and his crew ran small items like passengers or 'specialty cargo' that others wouldn't.\n\nHe'd gotten lucky, and he knew it. He was in mid-flight during the Shade Night and had managed to keep the shades from overwhelming his ship before the countermeasures were passed on.\n\nWhile his vessel was a smaller vessel, it was a smaller vessel for *junker* ships. Which meant that he was the size of a Space Force destroyer.\n\nThat meant buying a *lot* of mass to run off the lights and the like he needed.\n\nWhen the Flash happened, he'd been in a stellar system trying to deliver the warnings and countermeasures.\n\nThe ship's molycircs died a few hours later, the main reactor following it. The secondary reactor was a salvaged Space Force reactor, and it had held up a lot better.\n\nStill, he had been stuck at a remote space station for a couple of months while his ship was repaired and he hired new crew. The damage to the ship's computer systems had been extensive and patchwork, as he had hardened military systems mixed in with off the shelf components and systems of various expense and quality.\n\nWhich is why he was sitting in the empty bar, nursing his drink so slowly that the bartender VI kept going into sleep mode.\n\nHe looked up when a trio pushed through the plastic strips hanging down from the doorframe. In the lead was something Captain Vo<klik>Lagum hadn't seen that often.\n\nA Terran.\n\nSure, he'd seen the hordes of them rawfulstomping the Lanaktallan, Precursor Autonomous War Machines, the Dwellerspawn, the Atrekan, but since the Xenocide Event they were pretty much non-existent.\n\nThe one walking in was dressed strange and looked stranger.\n\nThe first thing Captain Lag noticed was how the stranger's eyes seemed to be hidden by the brim of his floppy wide-brimmed soft hat. His face was worn, gray in the bristles around his chin. The stranger obviously looked around, taking in the entirety of the bar. He had one what looked like a blanket wrapped around him, worn denim jeans, and a pair of leather boots with a high heel and pointed toes.\n\nAfter him came in a boxy little robot whose head was more optics and sensors than somewhere a VI braincase could be located.\n\nThe robot looked as old and worn as the Terran.\n\nNext was a Hashenesh that was carrying what Captain Lag had learned was a double-barrel breech action shotgun, the stock painted red. The Hashenesh looked around carefully, checking the shadows carefully, then followed the Terran and the robot.\n\nCaptain Lag felt a slight flutter of nervousness as the Terran stopped in front of the table he was sitting at. The eyes were suddenly visible.\n\nCold gunmetal gray eyes.\n\n\"You Captain Vo<klik>Lagum, owner, operator, Captain of the 'Uwu wuzzat?', a registered Junker's Guild salvage and transportation vessel,\" the Terran said.\n\nHis voice was rough and raspy, pitched low.\n\nCaptain Lag simply stared up, his beer forgotten.\n\nThe Terran dug a thick brown smokestick out of his pocket, along with a battered steel and flint striker, and lit the smokestick, puffing on it a few times.\n\n\"Well?\" the Terran asked.\n\n\"I am,\" Captain Vo<klik>Lagum stated. He waited for a translator to work and was surprised when the Terran merely nodded slowly.\n\n\"Your ship is down for repairs. The station techs can't figure out what's wrong with it, and you're just sitting here losing money while they wander around trying to remember to breathe and chew gum at the same time,\" the Terran said.\n\nCaptain Lag nodded jerkily. \"Yes. My ship was badly damaged by the Flash.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment before the Terran exhaled a long stream of smoke and spoke again.\n\n\"I need passage to a world. No name, just a survey number. I'll need dropship passage to the world. You will be paid half in advance, half when I step off the dropship. During the transit time I will provide access to my skills in any acceptable manner you deem necessary,\" the Terran said.\n\nCaptain Lag thought about it for a moment.\n\nTerrans were tough. They were smart. They had a wide range of technical skills. They had almost no fear of death. They lived for centuries, although some said they never truly died.\n\n\"My ship is still largely non-functional,\" Captain Lag said.\n\nThe Terran nodded. Captain Lag noticed that the Hashenesh and the robot were still, just looking around carefully.\n\n\"Of course it is. You had the primary reactors replaced, your sensors replaced, and now your computer core is throwing errors everywhere. Your jumpdrive core primary energy buffers are throwing errors and you can't figure out why, even though you keep replacing things,\" the Terran said, his voice still low and raspy.\n\n\"I suppose you can fix it?\" Captain Lag said.\n\nThe Terran shrugged. \"Perhaps. I have extensive experience repairing cobbled together systems with a wide variety of quality, many of the parts not designed to work together.\"\n\n\"And in Shadespace?\" Captain Lag asked.\n\nThe Terran shrugged again. \"I'll defend the ship to the best of my ability.\"\n\nThe Hashenesh snorted.\n\n\"It won't do my any good if we get taken out by shades an hour into jumpspace,\" the Terran finished.\n\nCaptain Lag swallowed down the rest of his drink and stood up, dusting off his hands.\n\n\"Well, let's get you a berth,\" he said.\n\n\\-----\n\nThe Terran and his two companions were silent as they went from the airlock to the main passage, then down to the living quarters. The rooms were spartan, small, lit with red lights at all times, a sodium light on a motion-phasic detector.\n\nCaptain Lag expected some protest at how small the room with a bunkbed was. Instead, the Terran merely examined the power port, nodded, then tossed his battered bags onto the bed. The Hashenesh, who Captain Lag expected to complain, just tossed a satchel on the bottom bunk. The robot moved over and plugged into the power port, a jaunty little tune playing when the connection was established.\n\nThe Terran tossed the blanket looking wrap on the bed, revealing that he wore a leather vest, two crossed gunbelts, and a heavy checkered flannel shirt.\n\nThe Terran turned around and looked at Captain Lag. \"Take me to an access port or a work terminal. Let's get a look at your computer systems first.\"\n\nDespite Captain Lag's expectations, the Terran didn't bring along a computer.\n\nThe Hashenesh simply brought along the double barreled shotgun.\n\nComputer maintenance was up one level and six bulkhead struts forward. The room was small, cramped, and the entire room was just a clutter of jury-rigged parts.\n\nThe Terran walked in, brushed some cabling out of the way, and sat down in the chair. He took a moment to adjust it, then set his fingers on the primary I/O port.\n\nCaptain Lag felt his eye ridges go up in shock as the computer ran POST several times and then suddenly booted up in safe mode.\n\nIt was more than the station techs had been able to do in four weeks.\n\nThe other thing that startled the Captain was how fast the data flashed by. He could see some screens that were up for almost a full second, but in the input boxes filled up almost too fast for the 2.5D 240p screen's refresh rate to keep up.\n\nIt reboot several more times, sometimes not getting past the POST and BIOS settings.\n\nFinally it came up in safe-mode and the Terran reached into his pocket, pulling out a can of narcrobrew. He handed it to the Hashenesh, then pulled out one for himself that he cracked open with the fingers on the hand he held the can with. The Hashenesh pried up the metal lever pull-tab and took a long drink as the Terran ran through more screens.\n\n\"How are you doing that with just the I/O port? How are you doing it so fast?\" Captain Lag asked.\n\n\"Genetics,\" was all the Terran said.\n\nThe Hashenesh just shrugged when Captain Lag looked at him.\n\n\"Found a lot of your problems,\" the Terran said. He closed his eyes for a moment, then reached out and grabbed a data-platter that had ejected from the data-port. The rectangular piece of plastic, an inch thick, had spools of iron-oxide on plastic ribbon inside.\n\n\"Here, Dana'ahsh. Take this to the public data-terminal and shove it in the slot. It'll pull the drivers I need,\" the Terran said. \"Take Wally with you.\"\n\nThe Hashenesh nodded, accepting the data-platter, then moved away.\n\n\"How do you prefer to be addressed?\" Captain Lag asked.\n\n\"Call me Harry,\" the Terran said. He shrugged. \"Terran, Hey-You, or You-Terran are all fine too.\"\n\nCaptain Lag nodded. \"Aren't you worried at directly accessing the computers? The station technicians are afraid of finding a shade.\"\n\nThe Terran just shrugged again. \"You've had a couple. I've handled shades before,\" he looked at Captain Lag. \"Easy way to purge a lot of them is to go into the BIOS settings, lower the minimum core processor and RAM voltage, raise the maximum to max tolerance for the voltage on both. Then you have the system reboot with a full RAM and core processor stress test that flips back and forth between minimum and maximum voltage.\"\n\nTo Captain Lag, it might as well have been Precursor babbling.\n\nThe Terran took another drink and pushed his finger against the I/O port again.\n\n\"Most computer systems are designed to handle a slight bit of phasic energy intrusion, so you can do phasic protective buffer degaussing with it and the shades fuck off to somewhere we don't have to care about,\" the Terran said.\n\nScreens flickered to life, showing different diagnostic screens that flashed by rapidly.\n\n\"Your biggest problem is that you have OEM plug and play drivers for your equipment. You primary reactor is stable, but not really usable since you're using standard one-size-fits-all drivers for a lot of the diagnostic and control systems,\" the Terran, Harry, said.\n\n\"The technicians ran the software installation pack,\" Captain Lag said, slightly defensively.\n\n\"And ran the autopatcher, then installed other software and ran their autopatchers,\" the Terran shrugged. \"It's all OEM stuff. All generic drivers,\" he took a drink off the can. \"It'd work, I guess,\" he shrugged, a motion that Captain Lag realized the Terran probably wasn't aware he was doing. \"The big problem is they didn't reinstall the drivers on the rest of the system, so the software can't really talk to one another.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Captain Lag said. \"How many days will it take to repair?\"\n\nThe Terran leaned back and again Captain Lag's eyebrow ridges raised in shock.\n\nA slightly glittering hologram of the Terran stayed behind, the fingertips stuck in the I/O Port.\n\n\"Once Dana'ahsh gets back? Probably an hour or two for the software. Then we'll run diagnostics, see what hardware is slagged,\" the Terran said. \"Wally can fab you up the parts once we give him the templates and access to your mass tanks. Any luck, a day, maybe two, and we'll have your ship ready to go.\"\n\nCaptain Lag stared for a long moment.\n\n\"How do you know all of this, human? Were you a starship engineer?\" he asked.\n\nThe Terran just shrugged again.\n\n\"You just pick stuff up.\"\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/111sgln/first_contact_chapter_903_it_all_falls_down/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1153yge/first_contact_chapter_905_it_all_falls_down/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

Nobody knows what USB-E was about. USB-F  stood for Fuck you, as it included an autorotator in the connector so you always had to try 6 times before it actually fit in the port, even though the connector had the same physical shape as the USB-B 3.0 connector. Finally, the galaxy standardised on USB-G, which reverted to the actually better connector of USB-D, but with improved structural design and supporting voltages up to 3kV. Still, *someone* made bodily fluids transfer also a mandatory part of the spec, but the galactic community just gave up at this point and most beings carry a power port cleaner around nowadays.",

    "body": "“It’s not even night yet and we’re being followed?” Reggie asks casually to Am and Koa. They’re driving alone inside Kati Downshift. She wanted to go out but didn’t feel safe doing so alone but didn’t want anyone driving her and it just kept going in circles. So they had bought and outfitted her with a holoprojector so that she could show a shrunken down version of herself in her own driver’s seat.\n\nShe starts giggling and all three men give her hologram an odd look. “They’re just jealous that I’ve got three men inside me and they can’t get any...” She jokes and the hologram flickers nervously as the men chuckle at the dirty joke.\n\n“Yes I... I... Uh...” She freezes as she sees one of the Phosa on the street. “Everybody out!” She screeches pulling over to the opposite side and the doors fly open. The men jump out and Kati zooms away back to The Dauntless.\n\n“And she was doing so well too.” Koa mutters.\n\n“Pity.” Reggie notes.\n\n“Until she lets go of her fear of Karen Darkdown enough to see another of her species without panicking then healing is going to be a long way off.” Koa grumps.\n\n“She did okay. It took a Phosa in a suit to scare her. A palette swapped version of her abuser, that’s a good step in the short time since she escaped from her multiple years of abuse.” Am says kindly and Reggie shrugs even as he shudders at the impulses his body is sending him.\n\n“She’s not the only one getting used to things.” Reggie growls.\n\n“It’s just lust dude. Find someplace private, rub it out, wash your hands and move on.” Am scolds him and gets a confused and angry look from Reggie.\n\n“Why am I with you two again?”\n\n“Because apparently we’re a team now with our knack for finding conspiracies.” Koa answers and Reggie groans.\n\nThe engineer just starts walking off. They all know the way back to The Dauntless so they’re not too worried about being abandoned by the panicking Kati.\n\n“So is there something you want to do? We have to get the people used to seeing humans in the capital, so it’s probably best to be doing something with it.” Am asks as he pulls out a book. He knows what he wants to do but the average bookstore doesn’t like random people walking in, pulling a book off the shelf and just reading it there without even buying it.\n\n“We...” Reggie begins glancing back and seeing the book, reminding him of the one he borrowed and is still carrying. “Why don’t we just find a park and hang out or something?” He remarks and Koa shrugs.\n\n“Sure, there should be some push cart snack venders or something. That might be interesting.” Koa thinks as Am tucks away his book and pulls out his communicator for directions.\n\nAbout half an hour later and all three of them are under a tree whose leaves shape into natural spirals. Apparently they collect the wind and build momentum to be partially buried in the ground where a new tree can sprout. It’s interesting, and fairly artistic. Koa’s already got a sample being preserved by a bit of plastic that had once held a thing on a stick he’d bought. He wasn’t completely sure what it was, but a quick scan had said it was alright to eat and the taste was something weird but not a bad weird.\n\n“What is that thing?” Reggie asks in confusion.\n\n“Half a fried squidbat? I don’t know. Tasty though.”\n\n“What was it called?” Am prompts as he flips the next page in his book, keeping track of the groups wandering around the park. Most if not all of them spend at least some time staring at them.\n\n“Oil seared Bynit half, on a stick. It’s weird but very inoffensive, I think I like it. Needs some salt though, hey you still got that shaker?” Koa asks and Am holds out the camping shaker. “Thank you.”\n\n“No don’t!” A woman screams as Koa puts the remainder of the Bynit into his mouth. Everyone freezes. “Desist! Do not! It’s deadly... poison...” The woman screaming slows down and starts gasping as she approaches before stopping near to them and gasping for breath.\n\n“Someone needs to stop skipping cardio.” Reggie remarks before he frowns as he realizes he was watching her bosom heaving. The alien woman has dark blue skin, glowing yellow eyes and jet black hair. She’s wearing an outfit that has the emblem of a training academy for local guards. The crème of the crop go to the Senate and stand around doing nothing on intergalactic television. The ones that don’t make the top grade do actual work with various companies and the ones that barely scrape by are given a license and that’s about it. This one would be lucky to get even that.\n\n“Can we help you?” Koa asks after finishing off his snack. He passes the shaker back to Am who tucks it away.\n\n“Oh goddess you ate it! I’m too late! Noooo!” She declares falling to her knees and howling at the sky as a pair of tiny batlike wings poke out behind her in her agitation. Tearing through her shirt in the process.\n\n“What are you doing now Nitta?” A very similar voice asks as a white haired version of the girl rushes up, much quicker and much more steady than the first and skids to a stop rather than staggering.\n\n“He’s going to die! He’s going to die because I couldn’t save him! His food was sabotaged and I... and I!” Nitta declares before falling to the ground and sobbing. “I’ll never get a boyfriend!” She starts bawling as the second one of the girls looks heavenward as if begging a higher power for patience.\n\n“What’s going on?” The new girl asks the less stunned and more amused, but still somewhat stunned trio.\n\n“I was just having a snack when she ran up screaming and then pitched this fit when I kept eating.” Koa remarks and Nitta heaves another sob.\n\n“The canister! It’s full of deadly poison and you sprinkled it all over your food!” She gasps out between sobs.\n\n“My digestion is very robust ma’am. I could eat the contents of that canister straight if the taste wouldn’t be overwhelming.” Koa begins assuring the hysterical little alien.\n\n“How much are you...”\n\n“I am not putting any money on it Am.”  He says not even looking at Am who chuckles in response.\n\n“Nothing can resist the amount of capsaicin that’s in that shaker, the sodium chloride or ground pain kernels... it’s all madness. He just put it on his bynit...” Nitta wept.\n\n“Miss, my species the Human are very, very resistant to poisons. I assure you, the contents of that canister were nothing but flavourings to me.”\n\n“Sir, are you alright?” The white haired one asks and Koa nods. “Are you certain? You do know humans aren’t real right?”\n\n“We’re not?” Reggie asks glancing at Koa. “Then what are we doing here? Shouldn’t we be in someone’s imagination?” He snarks out and gets a stern look from the girl.\n\n“Look, I don’t know who put you gentlemen up to this. But it’s not fair and it’s not nice. There is no race from Cruel Space, there is no species that has a one to one gender ratio. These sorts of things cannot possibly exist. Null is not only dangerous to all life but all things! It makes Axiom dissolve or detonate and Axiom is within all things. Therefore nothing can exist within that giant evil cloud of Null.”\n\n“We’re awfully solid for race that doesn’t exist.” Reggie notes to Am’s amusement.\n\n“Yes! Stir the shit! Let the Snark flow through you!” He adds in a mildly raspy voice.\n\n“Shut up.” Reggie responds and the Nerd starts chuckling.\n\n“What?” She asks as her inconsolable friend and possibly family member grabs onto her leg to keep up the exaggerated weeping. Koa is VERY aware of the large crowd that’s gathered to watch the drama. Am has already tucked his book away and is considering how exactly to get them out of the crowd turns on them for some reason.\n\n“Pop culture reference.” Koa waves it off even as he glances around. There’s a few more food venders taking wonderful advantage of the gathering crowd to the drama which include some things he hasn’t tried yet. But no doubt things would get odder if he were to get up and buy some himself. A pity.\n\n“I’ve never heard it before.”\n\n“It’s part of our pop culture. But seeing as how you don’t even believe in humans, though how the hell that’s possible is beyond me, it’s no wonder you haven’t seen it.” Koa remarks before looking around. “great, your little... sister?”\n\n“Yes my sister.” She says as Nitta’s bawling finally trails away to sniffling.\n\n“Her little drama queen act has cut me off from more snacks, rather...” The wind shifts as he speaks, picking up and carrying the scent that had previously lightly blowing away from the girls right into them. “rude... oh boy here we go.” The stories of what’s about to happen have been told long and often by any of the boys in the EFL.\n\n“Oh that... you... oh my... You’re in season!?” The still standing sister demands in shock as Nitta looks up towards Koa with tears in her eyes.\n\n“You must have someone to live beyond your death! Come here!” Nitta declares before diving at Koa. Am starts laughing out loud as Koa tries to wrestle the little freak off him with the help of her sister who puts her into a full nelson.\n\n“What are three men in the peak of their season doing out in public! You could run into a criminal or a slaver or...”\n\n“Is that common in Centris?” Reggie asks incredulously before glancing around the crowd. Sure a lot of them look downright hungry in ways he’s NOT comfortable with, but they don’t look anywhere near aggressive enough to take what they want by force.\n\n“There you are!” A familiar voice coos as Misty the Snict couger buzzes over the crowd. “I had heard you’d been rejuvenated by the healing sleep but this is astounding!” She coos as she saunters up to Reggie who looks like he’s staring down an oncoming train.\n\n“Hey! Is it really him?” Shireen asks forcing her way through the crowd. “Oh wow it is him, and he has friends!” The six bodied woman exclaims as her larger lower half easily parts the crowd.\n\n“Aren’t we popular?” Koa asks Reggie as Am chuckles and gets a dirty look in return.\n\n“Why don’t you attend to your own suitors? They clearly care for you deeply Koa.” Reggie returns as Am devolves into straight up giggling at this point at the sheer entertainment.\n\n“Until they stop trying to deny I even exist I’m not going to consider these two as courting me.” Koa says as Am snorts anew after finally getting his giggling under control. “Cork it you. This crowd’s going to spit out someone to start hitting on you soon enough, then we see exactly what kind of madness you attract.”\n\n“Oh dude I’m counting on it. Even without our little sideshows it was gonna happen because unlike you idiots this man’s got a plan.” Am boasts as he tucks his book away. “In fact they should be here any moment now.”\n\n“Dear god he does have a plan.” Reggie notes as he backs up a little from Misty who starts looming over him.\n\n“Now, from what I understand handsome, you have regained your capacity to perform, I was hoping that you’d be in a mood to test it out some, possibly with a lovely ripe Snict and maybe her Lydris friend as well?” Misty purrs down at him. She had clearly been getting ready for this as she looks ready to fall out of her dress with Shireen looking desperately awkward and earnest behind her as a counter point.\n\n“Amadi!” A familiar bouncy voice calls out. It’s Jenny the waitress, and what seems to be her entire immediate social circle.\n\n“You boys have fun with your girls. I’m about to figure out what a rabbit woman considers a small group of friends to get freaky with.” He says getting up. “Try not to get in over your heads bros.”\n\n“What the hell Am?” Reggie demands.\n\n“What? I want it, she wants to give it. What’s the problem?”\n\n“Do you have any idea what...”\n\n“Don’t care. Getting some.” Am cuts off Koa as he starts walking to the dozen exuberant rabbis women who are bouncing in many different ways to see him.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/o79j0t/out_of_cruel_space_part_38/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/o8is75/out_of_cruel_space_part_40/)",

    "body": "\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jgjcttm18pie1.gif\n\nTo figure out if I could survive a month off of just her amazing and delicate sweat, all of this will be based off of what I drink everyday(one full gallon of water) and other obvious things like weight, how much Evelyn is even producing to fill my gallon of water, how much salt intake i'm getting, the idea of me not eating or drinking anything that isn't Evelyn's sweat., etcetcetc\n\nFirst off, we need to figure out how long it would take to get my gallon of water even full. One gallon of water is around 4 liters of water, now, if we look at how much sweat is produced in an hour, We get around 500 mililiters of sweat or 1.5 liters of sweat produced in an hour. Meaning that it would take around 3 and a half to fully fill my jug.\n\nSo now we know that I need to put my jug under her armpits every night in a 80 degree room for 3 and a half hours every day. But now we need to SURVIVE off of it. Like I said, I am eating NOTHING or drinking NOTHING that isn't her amazing sweat, so we need to figure out if I would even be HYDRATED throughout this entire thing.\n\n(MATH PART RIGHT HERE if you don't wanna read everything else lmao)\n\nTo be hydrated, you need 3.7 liters of water(so what I already have in my jug), Sweat is actually 99% water with the other 1% being whatever else is in sweat. So I WOULD actually be kept hyrdated throughout this entire thing. BUT, we need to look at one thing that makes this challenge REALLY difficult, AKA Sodium Chloride(or Salt). Sweat has around 40-60 milimoles or 0.9 grams of salt inside of it. Now this is already a problem because of the fact that one lethal dose of salt is around 0.5-1 grams. This is when we need to take into account my weight. I weigh around 141 pounds or 63 kg, and a very good friend of mine told me that their weight was 65kg, which would take around 32.5 - 65 grams of salt to kill them. I think it's safe to say my range would also be around that as well. So now we need to figure out how much salt I would be taking throughout the month. All we need to do is multiply 30(average amount of days in a month) and 0.9(how much salt is in sweat), which would come out to 27 grams of taken. BUT, that's just a single drop of sweat, because a gallon of water contains around 3.4 grams(or 3.785 liters) of salt. So if we multiply the grams by the amount of liters with the amount of days in a month, 3.4g \\* 3.785L = 12.9g \\* 30 = 387 GRAMS OF SALT TAKEN IN WITHIN THE MONTH.\n\nThat's not even taking into account the other things inside sweat like urea and ammonia. Which consuming them would reintroduce them to into the body and straining kidneys and liver. Sweat also contains high levels of salt(obviously), and small amounts of potassium, magnesium, and calcium.\n\nSo OVERALL. Would I survive living off of Evelyn's sweat for a month? Hell no, I'd die the first week\n\nBUT, would it be glorious heaven? YES, EVELYN PLEASE DROP AS MUCH SWEAT AS YOU WANT INTO MY MOUTH.

That baby bird was mid, it didn't even have all of its drip, and didn't have any aura. When we found it, it was already on its L, having yeeted into a shrub — probably ghosted by its fam. We decided to stan for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter hit different, with cringe winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many sussy bakas and based beasts amongus... \n\nIt was clear that if we let the fledgling cook, it's giving no chance of glow-up. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the oomfs to F in the chat. We decided that when it aura farmed enough to flex, we would let it touch grass. The oof part — something that we'd never considered — was that this NPC's fate had already been cooked long before this moment... Its skibidi destiny was caught in 4k. \n\nNow, I pass the clout of choice to you all. Faced with this L+Ratio, what choice would you make? Stick to the woke plan, and cope where Charmony Dove fell? Or cagemaxx for and stan it, giving it galaxy gas from within my crib? I eagerly await your based takes.",

You sweat from all the pores from the body, not just armpits. You're missing out the sweat from her back, pubic region, and my favourite, feet. You have to somehow collect them all.\n\nFor the problem of over dosing on salt, a simple solution is to just reverse osmosis, meaning evaporate it and condense the water back. This opens an opprtunity to bask in her sweat vapor whlie boiling it. Imagine sitting in a sauna doused with her sweat. I can live off just that alone",

Over the pandemic I created a series of at-home lab practicals for students to do (easily adapted to irl teaching) with halite as a model system. It includes growing crystals like the ones you've shown, modifying the habit by adding impurities, demonstrating secondary nucleation and various nucleation triggers like loud noises, introductory thermodynamic calculations and also has some fun forays into the history of salt . \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm addicted though, I can't stop growing weirder and weirder salt crystals. I'm obsessed with growing high aspect ratio salt crystals (salt needles). I figured out how to grow them near-equilibrium which was cool but I'm over it now.  Recently I've been growing salt speleothems, which macroscopically fall somewhere between frostwork and soda straws . They aren't that impressive macroscopically, looking like 1 cm fuzzy whiskers, but in the SEM they're hecking bonkers.",

Some of you might recall the transparent [sodium chloride single crystals](https://crystalverse.com/sodium-chloride-crystals/) I grew a while back.\r  \n\r  \nWhile pyramid salt certainly occurs in nature, and is often sold as high quality salt, I had a lot of trouble finding a way to grow them reliably. It took a bit of time, but I think I have found a procedure that allows the formation of these hopper crystals. \r  \n\r  \nIt involves a high rate of evaporation on the surface of the solution in a large dish, kept at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius. I'm still working on the details now; I'll share a complete guide with you guys by this month.\r  \n\r  \nHopefully you found it interesting :)",

While being independent of ammunition supply does have its advantages in time intensive engagements, the energy efficiency of kinetics is nothing to neglect.*\n\n*That, and the incredible versatility offered by variable payloads.*\n\n*All you can adjust on a laser weapon is the intensity and duration of the burst, as well as the focus. To adjust the frequency, you need to change the light induction and amplification medium. And even then, what comes out is still a beam that will be more or less prone to the diminishing effects of atmospheric density and refraction, and can be greatly reduced in effectiveness by utilising reflective surfaces.*\n\n*Meanwhile, for kinetic rounds, mostly you only need to care about time on target, windage and gravity. They are a lot less affected by microprism clouds, humidity, and couldn't care less about reflective armor. When you go to relativistic kinetic accelerators such as nCv or C+ cannons, even the velocity advantage of the laser type weaponry can be negated.*\n\n*A laser beam will be just that, a laser beam. Countered by a single type of defense, no matter the color or intensity. A plasma charge will be just that, no matter what you do to it. A kinetic shell in the meantime, can be a nuclear warhead, an EMP charge, a neutronium penetrator discarding sabot round, a tandem charge, a canister round, a mine dispenser, a temporal stabiliser, and whatever the imagination, madness, and engineering talents of its makers can come up with. All coming out of the very same weapon, no alterations needed.*\n\n*Pair that up with the Terrans' mastery of nano-fabrication, and suddenly you don't have to worry about ammo supply any more. To think that kinetic weapons become obsolete the moment you learn how to make a laser pointer strong enough to burn a hole in a wall, is plain stupid, and you can all thank me for the opportunity to learn it here, and not the hard way out there like I did. -* Fragment of a recording recovered from the ruins of what archeologists suspect was a military academy, former Lagnalkak space. Speaker unknown.\n\n\\--got it-- 299 stated. --had to crack at kernel level sorry sorry--\n\n\"Nicely done,\" Bit.nek said. \"I'm probably going to need that access.\"\n\nBit.nek tilted his left palm up and started moving through the context menus, flipping through them. He ordered the heavy creation engine to start the warmup and slush phase, then checked the power on the reactor.\n\nSince flash night, reactors had a tendency to be a bit 'kicky' to use the current slang like all the cool kids.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the 2LT asked.\n\n\"We need weapons, armor, repeaters, signal amplifiers, shielded computers, heavy mortars to replace the mortars mortar platoon lost,\" Bit.nek said. \"Not to mention about fifty weapons because over half of you dropped your weapons when you routed.\"\n\nThe LT's back stiffened.\n\n\"Were we supposed to just stay there and die?\" the LT asked.\n\nBit.nek shook his head. \"You were supposed to fight,\" he said.\n\nThe LT opened his mouth.\n\n\"But Command never trained you to fight this war,\" Bit.nek said, scrolling through the context menu and bypassing a handful of overrides. \"They never taught you to fight Mister Hungry and Flickering Fionna.\"\n\nThe LT looked slightly angry. \"Well, who was going to teach us?\"\n\n\"Guys like me,\" Bit.nek said. He hit the print button, bypassed the warnings and lockouts, and authorized it with a blank header. \"Only there wasn't time,\" he looked up. \"About seventy percent of the guys with more than two decades of fighting in the Slorpie Slots got put out due to medical or took their walking papers.\"\n\nThe LT frowned. \"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"I was a high ranking officer's driver for about twenty years. Escorted him everywhere,\" Bit.nek said. He saw the creation engine flash ready and opened the drawer.\n\nA battered and beat up 15mm magac SMG sat there.\n\n\"Hello, baby,\" Bit.nek said, picking it up and slapping it on his hip so the magtac system held it.\n\n\"And that gave you...\"\n\n\"Plenty of insight into what was going on,\" Bit.nek said. He waited another moment for the creation engine to start beeping a warning, then pulled a case out of the drawer. He grabbed a smaller case and slapped it on his hip, then clumsily put the box on his back, bringing his rifle around to hang on his hip from the sling.\n\n\"I look like a fool,\" Bit.nek grumbled.\n\n\"What's that?\" SSG J'Wremt asked.\n\n\"Mission essential equipment,\" Bit.nek said. He walked over to the ledge, opening the case on his hip and pulling out a pair of ground crystal lens binoculars. He lifted them up, looking at the ranging lines on the side as he panned over the satellite dish field.\n\n\"I've never seen those. What model of macrobinoculars are those?\" SFC Lok<pop>Nartwa asked.\n\n\"Something called Zee-Why-Ice,\" Bit.nek said. He saw the flickering between the dishes. \"Dammit.\"\n\n\"What?\" the SFC asked.\n\n\"Fionna's dancing all over that damn field. It's getting thicker,\" Bit.nek said. He put the binoculars back in the case.\n\n\"HEY! I GOT SOMEONE!\" someone yelled from over by the tower.\n\nThat got excitement and Bit.nek realized with a sinking feeling that he might want to check on what exactly all these boots were doing.\n\n\"Good job, Tech,\" 2LT Ilvarwazz said, tapping one of the armored grunts on the top of his bare head. The kobold had his helmet retract and was kneeling down, a toolkit spread out in front of him.\n\nBit.nek walked up just in time to hear it.\n\n\"This is Kilo Company, 992 Infantry,\" the tech said.\n\n\"...we can read you... please respond...\" a voice said.\n\nBit.nek went cold.\n\n\"Ask them for proof of life,\" Bit.nek managed to get out.\n\nThe tech looked up at him, frowning.\n\n\"Do it,\" SFC Lok ordered.\n\n\"*Dominion of Stregeta,* this is Kilo, 992 Infantry, please provide proof of life,\" the tech said.\n\n\"That doesn't sound like one of ours,\" Bit.nek said, frowning.\n\n\"...we read you... please respond...\" the voice said.\n\nIt was louder.\n\n\"Wait, are you using digital or analog or quantum?\" Bit.nek asked.\n\n\"Quantum and digital. How else will he contact fleet?\" LT Ilvarwazz asked.\n\nBit.nek looked up at the top of the radio tower.\n\nThere were microwave and quantum dishes pointing in every direction.\n\nIncluding the satellite field.\n\n\"I ran it through the nearby satellite uplinks,\" the tech said. \"Someone cut out the wires, but I patched them.\"\n\n\"...life... proof... of...\"\n\nWhite line-art fingers pushed from the front of the radio.\n\nHis hand flashed to his side, his fingers curling around the hilt of his cutting bar. He yanked it out even as he took two steps, the cutting bar roaring to life between one step and the next as he shouldered between three people, knocking down one of the Staff Sergeants.\n\nHe kicked the kobold out of the way and swung with both hands from behind his head, the edge of the bar snapping a divot in the edge of the case on his back.\n\nThe radio squealed and sparks shot out from it as the cutting bar ripped it in half. Bit.nek cut twice, ripping the cabling apart and snapping the main power lead, his armor shunting the electricity into his battery packs and the left over into the ground.\n\nA white line-art arm was severed at mid-bicep, suddenly turning into clear slime and landing on the rooftop with a splat.\n\nBit.nek turned and stared at everyone.\n\n\"You almost invited Fionna right in with us, you fucking idiot boots!\" he yelled.\n\nThe gathered troops saw the red of his eyes and took a step back.\n\nBit.nek pointed at the radio with his idling cutting bar.\n\n\"It takes *one* to come through,\" he said. He shook his head. \"If, and that's a big if, you actually contacted fleet, then they are fucking dead. The ship's are full of Fionna and Mister Hungry, the dead and the dying,\" he said. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"During Operation Muddy Sanchez, the super-heavy battleship *Black Smoke Widow* had single shade get onboard. Everyone was dead in fifteen minutes and it had to be blown out of space.\"\n\nEveryone was staring at him.\n\n\"These things are *dangerous*. After encountering enemy armor, I can tell you that they're more dangerous than the enemy,\" he said. He pointed at the clear goo, which was evaporating in the cool night air. \"That thing almost got through.\"\n\nThere were nods and shocked looks.\n\n\"The first thing Fionna does is scream. That attracts more. The second thing she does is snatch out your eternal soul. The third thing she does is start eating it,\" Bit.nek said. He looked around. \"Twenty years ago? We thought only Terrans became shades,\" he shook his head. \"Like I said in that classroom, before we deployed, when the shades hit a Lanky world, we found out otherwise. It isn't one to one, like with Terrans, more like one to ten thousand, but when populations of worlds are in the tens of billions...\"\n\nHe turned away.\n\n\"No quantum. No digital. Nothing but magic band!\" he yelled out. \"Greenies, lock out *everything* not magic band. Lock out digital,\" he looked around. \"BURN THE CIRCS!\"\n\n\"You can't give that kind of order,\" LT Ilvarwazz snapped.\n\n\"BURN THE GRAVITY CURSED CIRCS!\" Bit.nek yelled.\n\n\\--they said will do-- 299 said.\n\n\"Thank you, gentlemen,\" Bit.nek said. He walked away, ignoring the babble behind him, and stood at the edge of the roof. He lifted up the binoculars and looked again.\n\nThe field was covered in flickering white and bluish white shapes.\n\n\"Dammit,\" he said softly.\n\n\"What?\" 2LT Yrk<pop>Nrawk asked, stepping up next to him.\n\n\"Sat-field is a major spawning and replication point,\" he said. He handed the binoculars over.\n\nThe LT put them against her eyes, squinting. She tapped the top then tried again before lowering them and looking down. \"Where's the enhance and zoom?\"\n\n\"Isn't any. No electronics. Ground crystal lenses, mylar coating, iron retaining rings, thin salt crystal wafer,\" Bit.nek said. He gave a chuckle. \"Major Tut'el designed them during Operation Double Chocolate Dip.\"\n\n\"Same Major Tut'el as our XO?\" LT Nrawk asked. She was looking through the binoculars again.\n\nBit.nek nodded. \"He was a Captain back then. Man's solid in a fight.\"\n\n\"Coming from you, that's a strong recommendation,\" the LT said. She handed back the binoculars. \"What's the plan?\"\n\n\"A stupid one,\" Bit.nek said. \"I'd tell you, but then you'd have to testify at my court martial,\" he said. He grinned, turned from the ledge, and walked back. He moved up to SFC Lok. \"Sergeant, you need to make prep.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" the Kelkark asked, slapping his tail on the roof.\n\n\"I've got the creation engine pumping out sodium chloride crystals. Put them across every doorway, two inch thick unbroken lines. Double line around the edges of the roof. There will be red LED spraypaint. Coat the roof, every bit of the piping and other shit up here. There's going to be rolls of mylar, cover all the access points with that,\" Bit.nek said. \"I prioritized that stuff over the mortars and the mortar round nanoforges. There will be a food forge setup before the mortars.\"\n\n\"Get the Company together,\" SFC Lok said. He bobbed his head. \"That I can do.\"\n\n\"What, you're just going to let a PFC order you around?\" LT Ilvarwazz asked as Bit.nek turned and started walking away.\n\n\"You have a plan, Lieutenant? Because I just got my orders from a man with over thirty years combat experience, a third of them fighting this kind of stuff,\" SFC Lok said. \"I'd love to hear the plan you've come with, with your eight months of active duty experience and your total of zero drop actual or simulated on a shade infested planet.\"\n\n\"You watch your...\" the LT started.\n\nBit.nek tuned them out, walking to the edge.\n\n\"What's your plan?\" LT Nrawk asked.\n\n\"You don't wanna know, sir,\" Bit.nek said. He took a deep breath. \"You need me to do this alone,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" the Rigellian female officer asked, rubbing her left forearm out of nervous habit.\n\n\"Because someone might think the Army or the Marines issued them a conscious,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"How bad will the blast be?\" the LT asked softly.\n\n\"At this range?

The windows were open, bringing in a slight breeze, but the computer still insisted it was the end of winter, so the heat was on despite what anyone tried to convince the VI of.\n\nBit.nek sat listening to Staff Sergeant R'Kalkrik, the Kilo Company Training NCOIC, as the Staff Sergeant went from the threats of the other military (Bit.nek forgot what they were called aside from Old Dressians or something like that) could put out to the next part.\n\n\"We'll be defending a Terran Tomb world in the Biological Artificial Sentience Systems,\" the SSG said.\n\nBit.nek yawned and got up, moving to the side of the room to stand at parade rest, joining a handful of others who were having trouble staying awake. There was no repercussions for doing so, it was considered the acceptable way to avoid falling asleep.\n\n\"Aside from any remaining BASS population, there are two main threats that we need to be aware of,\" the SSG said. He flicked the baton and a low-rez picture of a dead Terran appeared, its eyes amber, its mouth open and drooling black fluid, its skin bluish color.\n\n\"Shamblers. Reanimated Terran corpses. They are highly aggressive and come in several types. These were initially present after the Lanaktallan biocracking attack at the opening of the Confederacy/Council Conflict,\" the SSG said. \"Shade Night seemed to revitalize a lot of them. A data point to consider is that while this world wasn't biocracked by the Lanaktallan, it still had shamblers *prior* to the Shade Attack. Nobody is sure why.\"\n\nBit.nek nodded.\n\n\"Massive tissue loss can work, but unless the brain is damaged or destroyed, it's still an effective combatant,\" the SSG said.\n\n\"Yeah, but we'll be in armor,\" one of the Privates said.\n\n\"Even if we aren't in power armor, we'll be in standard hard plate. What's it going to do, chew on our armor?\" another added.\n\n\"Even barring that, we've got the sweat-plate,\" another said, referring to the nanite emergency armor.\n\n\"Won't help you,\" Bit.nek interjected.\n\nEveryone turned and looked at him. Bit.nek flushed slightly, his ears going rigid with embarrassment.\n\n\"Nevermind,\" he said, ducking his head.\n\nSomeone snorted as they all turned back to the lesson.\n\n\"The majority are uncoordinated, slow, and clumsy,\" SSG R'Kalkrik said. \"A small percentage are highly aggressive, run, and quickly enter some kind of frenzy. The last can show limited problem solving and limited tool use.\"\n\n\"They're all the same type,\" Bit.nek put in.\n\nAgain, everyone turned to look at him.\n\n\"It depends on the circumstances, but a shambler can turn into a sprinter can turn into a lurker real quick, as well as back and forth. There's no real way to tell any difference until they start to move,\" Bit.nek said. He looked at everyone. \"Uh...\"\n\n\"No, go on,\" SSG R'Kalkrik said. He motioned. \"Come on up here,  private. You can by my assistant. What did you mean that our armor wouldn't help?\"\n\nBit.nek, still flushing, moved to the front. \"These things can bite through battlesteel armor, tear off battlesteel armor from a limo. They can twist and bite through warsteel like its taffy,\" he said. He tapped next to the jaws. \"I've seen these things bite through the armored forearm of a suit of Rigellian heavy assault power armor, getting all the way down to the kinetic shock sleeve in a single bite, while their fingers punctured the armor and their grip deformed it.\"\n\n\"Pfft, no way, that's gotta be wrong,\" Sergeant Hal'krikit scoffed.\n\n\"You get four or five of these on you, they can rip your arms and legs off,\" Bit.nek insisted. \"Detainee's shaved muffin, I've seen guys torn in half by these things.\"\n\nThere was some murmurs of disbelief.\n\n\"If you end up doing CQC with them, don't bother with your pistol. When you stick your arm out to fire, one will lunge forward, grab your arm, bite clean through your armor,\" Bit.nek said. He closed his eyes and took a breath. \"Cutting bar and CQC manuevers. Keep them off of you, they *will* pull you down,\" he said when he opened his eyes. \"The smell gets through your armor, even if you're running on canned air.\"\n\nHe tapped the image with the wand, highlighting the hands and mouth. \"If you look with a phasic filter, the jaws and hands of one engaged in fighting or that's seen a target go immediately to whitish-purple, more phasic energy than an Atrekna attack or a Mantid Warrior caste or Speaker caste bladearm.\"\n\nThere was dead silence.\n\n\"If one sees you and screeches, you've been made. That will snap any in hearing range out of torpor and draw them in. Any shambler that's mobile will repeat the shriek and have a high chance of shifting from stumbler to sprinter. The shrieks will be repeated until every damn rotter in the city is now heading toward your position,\" Bit.nek said. \"You have to, no, you *need* to immediately withdraw or dig in, because you're about to be fighting hundreds, if not thousands or tens of thousands of them.\"\n\nBit.nek tapped the image. \"Worse, their shrieks wake up any shades in the area, which will immediately head toward the shrieking. That's when it gets down to cutting bars, fists, sweat, and bad breath.\"\n\nHe handed the baton back to SSG R'Kalkrik. \"Don't make any mistake, they're extremely dangerous and seem to be able to find any gap in your defenses. Saw some find out that a storm drain that had collapsed a mile away led to the basement of a collapsed building that had a crack in the wall that led to maintenance tunnels that opened up into the main logistics base's barracks basement,\" he said.\n\nHe sat down.\n\n\"One minute we were eating, the next they were everywhere and a quarter of the division was down.\"\n\nThat brought silence.\n\nThe SSG looked around. \"Any questions?\"\n\nEveryone shook their head.\n\n\"We'll move on to shades, then,\" he said. He clicked the remote and the image of a shade appeared, done up in crimson.\n\nBit.nek gave a sigh of relief, then listened to the briefing, several times shaking his head.\n\n\"I'd like to hear your input, Private,\" the Training NCO said.\n\n\"Sure, why not?\" Bit.nek sighed. He got up and accepted the baton. He tapped the image of the shade, a Terran male with red eyes and a screaming mouth.\n\n\"Everything in that was stupid. Whoever put that together has never even seen redacted video footage of these things,\" Bit.nek said. \"First things first. If we're dropping into a Tomb World, you need to disable your picture in picture in your retinal link. If you're smart, you'll go from full color to red monochrome, maybe some silver in it, for your eyes as well as any visuals, from holotanks to armor visor to scopes.\"\n\nHe tapped the shade. \"If you see this on the monitor, in full color, he's about to climb out of the monitor and kill everyone in the room. They can jump through imaging. They can jump out of holograms. They can jump out of this...\"\n\nHe held up his palm emitter and put up a hologram of an angry-face emoji. \"He'll jump out of my palm emitter, while I'm laying there dead, jump to each of your picture in picture, meaning he'll climb out of your Daxin cursed *eyeball*, and he'll jump into your armor with you or climb out of your faceplate while you're in there dead.\"\n\nHe tapped the image again. \"Not one jumping in between. He *multiplies* across them. Now, instead of one annoying and aggravating shade, we've got,\" he counted the platoon real quick. \"Forty-two of him, all mad as hell and looking for someone to kill.\"\n\nBit.nek turned and stared at the image. \"Just one can wipe out a city in hours,\" he said softly. He turned back to the class.\n\n\"Artillery, close air support, mines, crew served weapons, none of them effect that Shades,\" he said. \"Iron, iron-oxide, sodium chloride crystals, dog-boi howls, and sheer rage is all that works,\" he told them. \"They can't cross the color red, but only a specific RGB code, the rest they can get through if they want it bad enough,\" he tapped the image. \"And believe me, he wants *you* bad.\"\n\n\"Shotguns work. Magac, rifles, shard guns, they don't. Standard old Terran saloon broom works if it's packed with iron and salt. Swords, knives, cutting bars with salt crystals on it or iron teeth,\" he chuckled. \"We loaded the auto-replacement chain with an iron one and just hot-swapped if we had to. Everyone's cutting bar's blade was painted red. Hell, our underwear was dyed red.\"\n\nHe looked back. \"Dogboi howls can cause them to flee on one howl, disrupt on two, kill on the third,\" he said. \"BUT, it has to be live or recorded on finely ground iron-oxide on mylar recording strips, played back analog. Digital doesn't even phase them,\" he tapped his thigh pocket. \"I keep a mini-player in my pocket with a cassette of a bunch of dogboi troopers from 19th Special Tasks howling.\"\n\nHe tapped it again. \"They move at variable rates, but some have been clocked by phasic scanners as moving up to fourty miles an hour. Those ones are usually the most phasic flush,\" he said. He shook his head. \"Phasic snappers don't do anything, neither does chronotron poppers. Anti-matter, even iron atom, doesn't do anything. Lasers, masers, plasma, grasers, gravers, nothing.\"\n\nHe stared at them. \"Rock sodium chloride crystal, iron oxide and iron are it. No grav or mag propellant,\" he gave a chuckle. \"Standard chemical is your best. We figured mag and grav made it go too fast.\"\n\nHe tapped it again. \"Center mass or head shots work. Up close and personal, just start hacking. You've gotta be mad. Fear and they'll reach past your guard and rip your guts out. Think about the time your Sergeant jumped up your ass for nothing, or how your girl cheated on you in Basic, or how the LT is too stupid to live and that's why you're fighting for your life against a bunch of dead Terrans,\" he said. \"Rage is the key. Anger. The angrier, the better. Direct it straight at the shades if you can. Violent anger, not impotent. Take your rage out with every shot, every swing,\" he said.\n\nHe walked back and forth, pacing, in front of the platoon.\n\n\"We're going into a Tomb World. If Space Force has its shit together, first thing they'll do is check the ansible. A lot of these quikwipe systems, their ansible is still up and connected to ShadeNet. That means it's haunted,\" he gave a bitter laugh, still pacing. \"They've gotta take down the hypercom and needlecast too, they're haunted. Then, they take out the system communication infrastructure, then the planetary orbital commo network. Then orbital strikes on the uplink farms,\" he said. \"Then they drop us,\" he flicked to a new image. Grassy field on one side, city on the other. \"They're supposed to drop you away from population centers, but some dipshit always launches a brigade or so into a city. If you end up the poor bastard in the city, you dig in and you dig in fast. Sodium chloride crystal rings, a double-pounder salt box. Make sure everything is the correct shade of red,\" he said.\n\nHe stopped tapping the image of the city. \"If you're here, you're probably more fucked than a Conex joyboy on payday. You need to dig in and fast, because they're on their way.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter if Space Force doesn't see any. They're invisible when they're torpid. The shamblers look like corpses and you can't pick them up on thermal or phasic,\" he shook his head. \"The whole world can be killed by one idiot.\"\n\nHe tapped the city again. \"Some dipshit finds a video file of a shade attack and plays it. The shades jump out. That makes the panic button go off in the house. Their security company checks the monitors, copies of the shades pop out of the monitors, jump into other houses on other monitors. They flood the street, the lawsec cams pick them up, copies jump out into the lawsec overwatch. Next thing you know, the whole planet is covered.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"From a single shade on a dataslate to millions and a dead world happens in days, weeks at the most. There's always survivors though. Life is tough and it finds a way.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at the grassy field, tapping it with the pointer. \"The Warfa... uh, the Colonel would always check for survivors and link up. They'll have data relevant to that theater,\" he tapped his sleeve and his adaptive camouflage went red. \"This should be your standard. However,\" he tapped it again and to most of the troops it looked the same. To a few others, including the dogboi in the back, it looked slightly different. \"Three hue points. Standard armor red would allow their fingertips through and then you're hurting.\"\n\nHe turned back to the image. \"The MI guys and the eggheads, they say that the shades rip out your phasic energy, others mumble about bio-electricity, but we all know what we saw.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at the class. \"What they rip out? It's screaming while they eat it. It's your *soul* they're pulling out, and it hurts while they're eating you.\"\n\nHe heaved a sigh. \"So, crimson, iron oxide, iron, sodium chloride, rage,\" he said. \"The eggheads and the docs and the goldies and MI all mumble about why it works, but I've been on the ground, I know why it works.\"\n\nHe looked over  the class. \"Anyone wanna guess why?\"\n\nNobody said anything.\n\nBit.nek nodded. \"Blood. Terran blood. It's red, it's full of salt, and it's full of iron. It's full of wrath and rage.\"\n\nHe handed the pointer back and moved over against the wall, going to parade rest.\n\n\"Good talk,\" he said.\n\nThe Training NCO shook his head, concealing a smile.\n\n\"Any questions?\"\n\n\\-----\n\nLieutenant Colonel Ssalressk turned off the survelliance video and looked at Major Tut'el.\n\n\"Anything you'd like to add, Major?\" the Colonel asked.\n\n\"No, sir,\" Tut'el said. \"Bit.nek's Bit.nek, but he knows his stuff.\"\n\nThe Colonel nodded. \"You two served together?\"\n\nTut'el nodded. \"Yes, sir. Eighteen Shade Drops. Man's a war fighter. In garrison, well, he's Bit.nek, but war fighters don't do good in garrison.\"\n\nThe Colonel looked at the Sergeant Major. \"Have the other Training NCO's look over that lecture. Have them go over Tut'el's notes,\" he looked at Tut'el. \"We'll use your training plan with the PFC's addendums.\"\n\nHe looked at the phone. \"I'll tell Brigade and Division we need to chuck the TRADOC training and use that.\"\n\nThe Colonel looked at Major Tut'el.\n\n\"I'll take metal meets the meat experience over TRADOC any day,\" he said. He sighed. \"We'll be loading up for deployment in two days.\"\n\n\"Cryo or live transport?\" Tut'el asked.\n\n\"Cryo,\" the Colonel said. \"They changed it yesterday.\"\n\n\"Safest bet. Red light in the hallways, on the hull, whole red yard,\" Tut'el said.\n\n\"Space Force said they'll be running with red rather than white hulls,\" the Colonel said. He looked at Tut'el. \"I want you right next to me the whole time. If I'm screwing up, or about to get my men killed, you countermand me right there,\" he said. \"That's the Job of the XO.\"\n\nThe Colonel leaned forward slightly. \"You worry about our men's lives, not my feelings, understand, Major?\"\n\nTut'el just nodded.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/14b7ols/first_contact_chapter_968_the_shadows_of_twilight/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/14emc61/first_contact_chapter_970_the_shadows_of_twilight/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

Hope tis worthy and what I recalled is accurate.)\n\nA freshfaced Welkrat Private raises their hand, and blurts out \"What about the Goodbois...? Why...?\" when Bit'nek nods at them.\n\nBit'nek pauses a minute, then softly half smiles. \"The Warfa-errrrr, Colonel Vuxten had an idea about that, too. It is because they are the best boys. His greenie found the frequency and mix that we carry to this day as he died. Col Vuxten served with Daxin Freeborn and his Goodboi FIDO extensively  in the war on Heaven. Their bond was complete harmony. \n\nHumans have fought beside their companions for longer than they can remember. The hiss or yowl of a purrpot can have some effect as well if there is no other help to be found. Some shades will respond just as strongly to those sounds or a purr, but most will be barely delayed a fraction of a moment, though the claws of a pure strain living  purrpot are shockingly effective... Most think this is because their spite matches that of the shades. They're nearly as old a companion to the humies... but their natures and form of symbiosis are different. Wolves were invited in, given a place to play, be warm, fed, and loved. Cats walked up, said \"I want what they're getting and to eat your tasty vermin. Pet me. Maybe I love you. Sometimes. Baka.\"\n\n Some say it is the call of home that allows a Goodboi howl to reach a human. . The Call Of kin. The mad lemurs' best friends were the 60 kilo plus apex predators that chose to fight with them so early in their history. CHOSE to be their best friends. Their pack. Their clan. Clutch. Flock. Murder. Clowder. FAMILY. \n\nSomething about that connection calls to the shades. They are pack to marrow and blood in their canine veins, to the digital marrow and veins, the soul fragments of the enraged, insatiable Terran remnants that are the shades. The shades never look in pain when the goodboi and sapient equivalent howls/barks kill them. It is the oddest thing. Howls of parting have the widest area of effect, and work at the lowest decibels. Particularly when the howl has longing, or defiance.... those are the most powerful howls but for one. \n\nThe pack singing with joy. The joy of a full moon. The joy of a good hunt. The joy of a birth. The joy of the pack. If you have that/those on loop, the shades just... poof. With the shamblers, you always have to aim for the head. The shades are mostly digitized souls, the shamblers mostly empty meat husks... and meat must be met by metal... But even some of them will.... slow... just a smidge.... when they hear a goodboi's howl... and when the howls are full of joy, some die smilin. It's the damnedest things, even if the eggheads say it is stupid shit \"biologically unrelated\" reasons.\" We know. Even in death, their best friends' souls reach out to and comfort the Terrans through the songs they have shared for countless generations, sung as only the Goodbois can sing them.",

Many point to the fact that they had not undergone endless rounds of \"gentling' at the hands of the Lanaktallan and the Unified Council. Others say it is their warlike nature, hidden under a thin veneer of civilization. Others point at the oppression of the Unified Council and then the cruelty of the Precursor Autonomous War Machines, claiming that those two factors brought out the same kind of element present in the species of Terra-Sol, who have known nothing but war.*\n\n*No matter what the cause, the fact remains: The Telkan and the Leebaw are the most likely to become Enraged, with the Hesstlan and the Treana'ad right after.* \\- Considerations of the Legacy of Terra-Sol, *Ponders The Unponderable,* Free Mantid Press, 8932 PG\n\nThey come to kill the Rooster, but he ain't gonna die. - Steel Bound Alice, Terra-Sol, Age of Paranoia\n\n*The brain and experience drain after the Second Precursor War ended cannot be overstated. While only a handful of years passed for the inhabitants of the greater universe, some vets of the war lived up to three hundred years in a combat theater under fire every day.*\n\n*The Terran Xenocide Event left vast swaths of territory undefended, and the enemies of the Confederacy moved rapidly to take advantage of that fact. With over two thirds of the heavy quick response units in Lanaktallan Space, it should have been possible to rebuff the new combatants quickly with the guard units, planetary and system defense forces, and the third of active quick reaction forces.*\n\n*But the the Atrekna War had left nearly eighty-percent of the veterans unfit for duty, due to age or trauma.*\n\n*In a normal war, the rotation of experienced troops into inexperienced units provides a good backbone for the new unit. Due to temporal disruption and the brain/experience drain, the plethora of experienced troops did not exist.*\n\n*This led to very few experienced veterans, veterans of a war of a completely different type, to be seeded in inexperienced units.*\n\n*The early cost was immense.* \\- Post-Xenocide Conflicts of the Confederacy, 9921 PG, Free Mantid Press\n\nMajor Tut'el finished walking the HHC 992 line, checking the line of sodium chloride, taking a look at the red paint all over everything, and calming a few jittery officers.\n\nHis armor looked like the designer had decided to make red armor and everything else was a reflection of the fact that the armor was to be red. No scuffs, no marks, no scratches. Pristine armor without a single flaw. He had his faceplate set to transparent so that the troops could see his face, and made sure that they were armed with cutting bar and rifle, just as he was. His greenie battle buddy was sitting on his shoulder, leaning against the rocket launcher, waving at some of the other greenies.\n\nHHC had picked up a separated mortar platoon, which Major Tut'el had overseen digging in, and he walked over to double-check the anti-fragmentation netting around the Fast Transport Site where the nanoforge was printing out mortar rounds, propellant rings, and fuzes. He checked the thickness by rubbing it between his thumb and forefinger, then moved on to checking the distance between the ammo, the fuzes, and the prop rings.\n\n*Ya gotta make sure they're far enough apart they don't start arguing and blow you up, sir*, he heard the big one-eyed Terran's voice in his head. *Ya don't mix lot numbers, ammo types, or just pile it all up in a heap, or it blows up and kills everyone.*\n\nTut'el nodded and lifted his chin as he walked between the 60mm mortar shells and the 4.2 inch mortar shells.\n\nHe could hear the faint snarl between the two of them.\n\n\"Stop that,\" he said softly. \"It'll be your time soon enough,\" he grazed his armored fingertips over the wooden boxes the rounds were inside.\n\nThe snarling lowered to a low growl to his senses.\n\n\"Sir?\" Lieutenant Fraktexin asked, staring at the Telkan officer. The kobold mortar officer found himself oddly intimidated by the fastidious appearing Telkan.\n\n\"Just reminding the ammo that they're to kill the enemy, not each other, not us,\" Major Tut'el said, his voice distant and remote. \"Make sure you have an enlisted move through the stacks and pat the ammo. Tell it that it's all good ammo.\"\n\n\"Uh... sir?\" the kobold asked. In thirty years he'd never heard of anything like that.\n\nTut'el moved over and looked at an open box of fuzes. Variable setting. He nodded and closed the wooden box lid. \"Soon, little ones,\" he said. He looked at the kobold. \"The ammunition knows the Enemy is coming and is eager. Nothing out of the ordinary,\" he said.\n\nThe kobold nodded jerkily.\n\n\"Carry on, Lieutenant,\" Tut'el said, moving out of the FTP and heading toward the generator pit. The greenie riding on the Major's shoulder waved.\n\nAt the generator pit he just traced the line of heavy cables with his eyes, walked by and looked over the gauges. His greenie jumped off to scurry around the generators, pausing to talk rapidly with two other green mantids. He looked over the connections, not touching the cables, but checking to make sure the locking rings showed red for full lock and no unlocked green coloration on the paint indicator. He looked over the junctions without touching, then walked around and looked at the grounding rods.\n\nSeveral privates saw Major Tut'el looking and rushed off to get their OIC.\n\nThe lieutenant came in to see Major Tut'el looking at the open power switching box, a greenie on top of it talking rapidly, the Major's greenie on his shoulder.\n\n\"May I help you, sir?\" Lieutenant Dremkri'ik asked, feeling his spines raise up to tap inside his helmet.\n\nThe Major made him nervous. He rarely raised his voice, he never made threats, he rarely cursed. His movements were precise, controlled, and the Major always appeared thoughtful and considerate.\n\nBut the Major still made Lieutenant Dremkri'ik very very nervous.\n\n\"Just making sure that everything you need has been provided and there is no difficulty,\" Major Tut'el said, not taking his eyes away. \"Six two two here says everything has been going well.\"\n\nThe Major turned to face Lieutenant Dremkri'ik and nodded slowly. \"I realize liquid fuel generator backup is unusual, but Terran psychic impression shades can disrupt fusion and zero point reactors. Fission is also risky.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lieutenant Dremkri'ik said. \"Uh, I wasn't aware of it, sir.\"\n\nMajor Tut'el just nodded again. \"The SOP for power generation hasn't percolated through TRADOC yet, as they appear to still be putting out doctrine from lessons learned from the Mar-gite War,\" he looked around. \"You should be receiving doctrine updates from the Atrekna Contested Zone in, oh, five or six hundred years Galactic.\"\n\nIt took a moment for Lieutenant Dremkri'ik to realize it was a joke.\n\nBy that time the Major had moved on, heading for the gap in the berm. \"Carry on, Lieutenant,\" the Major said.\n\nHis greenie waved.\n\nHe moved silently to the commo shed.\n\nTwo of the privates standing guard saw the Major shift his off hand to the grip of his cutting bar when the Major glanced at the commo shed and the massive uplink dishes. He moved around the shed, checking the paint, looking at the thick sodium chloride lines, then moved away.\n\nBoth privates exhaled a sigh of relief when the Major moved on.\n\n\"Ever feel like he's just waiting to get a bunch of us in a group so he can just go all Enraged Phillip on our asses?\" one PFC asked the other.\n\nThe other one just nodded.\n\nTut'el nodded to a pair of Captains and an SFC as he moved toward where the TOC was buried in the ground. Both hurried away.\n\nHe ducked through the thick reddish mylar strips and moved into the TOC itself.\n\n\"Ah, Major, there you are,\" Lieutenant Colonel Ssalressk said from where he and Sergeant Major Hsst<klik>Ssar were standing by a holotank that was projecting the surrounding area in red and silver.\n\n\"Just doing a few spot checks,\" Tut'el said.\n\n\"Now now, you don't want everyone to think you don't trust them, Major,\" the Colonel said.\n\nTut'el shook his head. \"It is not their skills and dedication I doubt, sir,\" Tut'el said. \"It is the fact we did not have proper training time before deployment. I have to ensure that there is no questions or difficulties with these on-the-fly adjustments.\"\n\nThe Colonel chuckled. \"An excellent answer, Major,\" he said. He waved, come over here, help me figure out what to do with Nine Nine Two.\"\n\n\"New problems?\" Tut'el asked.\n\nThe Sergeant Major poked the holo-display. \"We're scattered across a teardrop shaped area eight hundred miles across and, at its widest, two hundred miles thick,\" he said. He tapped a city. \"Kilo Company got dropped in the city.\"\n\nHe looked up. \"As of two hours ago, there was a group of over a hundred Kilo Company elements right here, with the rest that are mobile moving toward that point,\" he said. He looked back down at the skyraker apartment building. \"An hour ago, every single transponder and IFF on that roof just cut out.\"\n\n\"Flyby recon?\" Tut'el asked, moving up and looking down.\n\n\"Drone gave us this ten minutes ago,\" the Colonel said. A window appeared above the skyraker, done in silver and red, showing troops moving around. \"Looks like they towed a drop pod to the roof.\"\n\n\"When the drone got within a half mile, it started getting heavy UHF signals. Signal platoon figured out that it was a fairly wide band analog transmission of the transponders,\" the Sergeant Major said.\n\nTut'el nodded. \"Is that the company PFC Bit.nek was assigned to?\" he asked.\n\nThe Sergeant Major nodded.\n\n\"He's the reason the IFF and transponder have cut off. There's shades in the city and his CO must be taking his advice and moving to shade protocols,\" Tut'el said.\n\n\"Sir, the *Ice Cream Heaven* is in position,\" one of the techs said, looking up from their commo board.\n\n\"Do we have satellite in the area?\" the Colonel asked, not turning away from the tank, just magnifying one section.\n\n\"No. *Ice Cream Heaven* said they'll report on the results of their orbital strikes,\" the tech said. They put their hand to their ear. \"Firing in three, two, one...\"\n\nTut'el saw that the heavy battle cruiser was firing at the planetary communication uplink field outside the city.\n\n\"Volley One fired. Volley Two fired. Volley Three fired,\" the tech said.\n\nThere was a simulated explosion in the middle of the field. Three spaced plasma cannon volleys.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"Planetary defensive shielding was successful in diverting the shots,\" the tech said. \"No damage to the uplink field.\"\n\nThe Colonel shook his head. \"We *have* to disable that field. Tell fleet that they need to figure out a way to disable those defense shields.\"\n\nHe moved over to the hologram of that skyraker that Kilo Company was on top of.\n\n\"If worse comes to worse, we'll use high speed drones with message packets to tell Kilo Company to destroy the planetary defense system,\" he tapped the city marker. \"It's in the city, they'll have to fight their way in, but once that's disabled we'll be able to use orbital strikes to...\"\n\nIt floated up on the holotank and in Tut'el's vision.\n\n**ATOMIC ATOMIC ATOMIC**\n\nThe detonation warning was at the uplink field.\n\nAn icon appeared on top of one of the tallest buildings at the edge of the city.\n\n**XM388A9E12/W58A2E3 - SALTED**\n\n**25-240KT YIELD**\n\n**ATOMIC ATOMIC ATOMIC**\n\nThe Colonel looked up.\n\n\"Your boy, I assume?\"\n\nTut'el just nodded, his face remote and uncaring.\n\n\\-----\n\n\"Stupid cheap ass template,\" Bit.nek cursed, banging on the side of the heavy box he had been carrying. He looked up at the satellite field.\n\nThe plasma volley had lanced down out of the atmosphere and Bit.nek had been close enough to see the defensive arrays go to work.\n\nAt the edge of the city, it looked like a faint wall of hexagons interposed itself between the field and the city. A dome appeared above the uplink dishes, with what looked like an hourglass of burning white fire above it.\n\nThe plasma lances had been diverted through magnetic and gravitational forces into the hourglass and Bit.nek had seen the energy twisted and fired straight back along their paths.\n\nBit.nek shook his head even as the shockwave from the thermal energy transfer washed over him, not even rocking him in his armor.\n\n\\--what happen why no work-- 299 asked.\n\n\"Planetary defenses are still online,\" Bit.nek said. He narrowed his eyes. \"They didn't shoot their way in,\" he mused. He shook his head. \"Might have come in at the poles or over the heavy ocean side. That's the problem with this single super-continent planets.\"\n\n\\--oh--\n\n\"You've got to disable the planetary defense matrix if you want to use orbital weapons,\" he said. He pulled at the case harder.\n\nIt made a pop noise and the latch popped open.\n\n\"Finally,\" Bit.nek said. He reached in and picked up the weapon inside.\n\nA James Bowie launcher.\n\n\\--oh shit--\n\n\"Take it easy,\" Bit.nek said.\n\n\\--where power-- the mantid asked.\n\n\"This one's completely mechanical. No digital electronics, no power,\" Bit.nek said. He hefted the launcher, checked it over, set it down. He lifted up the single warhead and inspected it.\n\n\\--what doing-- 299 asked.\n\n\"Setting it for sixty-five kilotons, enhanced burst,\" Bit.nek answered. \"This one has a thorium salt jacket.\"\n\n\\--why--\n\n\"Radiation cascade does a number on Terran cells,\" Bit.nek said. \"The shambler's skin will melt off and their organs will turn to liquid shit. Give it 72 hours and every shamber that caught a burst of rads will be fucked.\"\n\n\\--oh-- 299 waited a moment. --uh atomics not authorized--\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" Bit.nek locked the round into the launcher. \"Things change.\"\n\nHe aimed the launcher, going by eyeball and mechanical sight.\n\nThe rocket would reach the field, five miles away, detonate two hundred meters up.\n\nHe did it all by eye and memory.\n\nHe triggered his radio.\n\n\"ATOMIC ATOMIC ATOMIC!\" he called out.\n\nHe saw it flash up in his vision.\n\n\"Fire in the hole,\" he said.\n\nAnd pulled the trigger.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/f94rak/oc_pthok_eats_an_ice_cream_cone/)\\] \\[[prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/14kv6cr/first_contact_chapter_976_the_shadows_of_twilight/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/14pua33/first_contact_chapter_978_the_shadows_of_twilight/)\\] - \\[[wiki](https://fcgestalt.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_Gestalt_Archive_Wiki)\\]",

FREE MIDGET STRIPPERS AND BEER FOR EVERYONE!\n\nLet's get it on with the safety briefing, shall we?\n\nDon't drink and drive. Don't ride bears or lions to the liquor store. Don't ride fat men to the candy store. Don't beat your kids, your spouse, the mailman, your significant other, the neighbor, your pets. Don't buy, sell, manufacture, transport, store, or take or rectally insert illegal drugs. Get the candy before you get in the van. If they chase you, shooting at you, they probably won't make good friends. Don't punch wildlife in the head, they hate that. If you hear screaming, run toward it. Midgets may or may not grant wishes if you catch them, depending on the wish and if the midget is sexy. Try to stay out of jail or the hospital but if you can't, make sure it's for a good reason.\n\nBe good to yourself and others. Love yourself. If you're struggling, don't do it alone. Reach out to someone. Smile at yourself in the mirror, it actually helps.\n\nRemember, there's only one of you and that's pretty amazing.\n\nSee everyone on Monday. Have a good weekend. Remember to close your eyes and hug yourself, it really can make you feel better. Hold onto each other.\n\nI know, these are dark times and there seems to be no end in sight.\n\nBut we've all got each other, and we've all survived worse.\n\nYou can make it. I believe in you.\n\nWelp, on that, let's rattle the tin cup!

    "body": "\\[Originally posted to a WP in r/humansarespaceorcs \\]\n\nClan Leader Yondarn,\n\nI am returning to the homeworld. The summit proved to be, in most respects, as profitable as we expected. The Hyul have agreed to our trade concessions, the C’vag Imperium is withdrawing from the Orion Compact, and the Lolin are still a bunch of interbrood fornicating half-wits.\n\nWhere the summit proved to be infinitely more profitable was making contact with a recent addition to the political landscape. During the second evening of the conference, the Aldebaran Ambassador was arrested when they were charged with attempting to poison a delegate from a species called ‘Human’ who recently won a small war between the two species. According to the rumors, the Aldebaran had slipped enough capsaicin into the delegates meal to kill a fully matured Yondiri Bog Elephant. Naturally, when the delegate returned, very much alive, he was enraged and confused. The Aldebaran ended up confessing in front of the entire summit when he went on a tirade about ‘what does it take to kill you people?’\n\nNow, as you know, the Kithnar ambassador and I attended Fleet Academy together and have been bloodsworn to each other more than once. So, naturally when we heard about this, we had to investigate. We invited the Human to a Cultural Exchange dinner in order to make the new comer feel ‘more welcome’ and so we could observe.\n\nClan Leader, after the observation and further research, I can not emphasize enough how much this species terrifies me.\n\nGeorge, the Human delegate, joined us in my quarters shortly after the delivery of his peoples ethnic cuisines. Humans are, apparently, omnivores able to nourish themselves from both Flora and Fauna. Being that the species evolved on a Death World, this is hardly surprising.\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries and sampling several courses, the Kithnar opted to make the first move and inquired about the attempted assassination.\n\nTo quote the human directly:\n\n“Oh yeah, at first I thought the chef just messed up, cause ho boy was that spicy, but then I found out the dumbass Squidhead had spiked my meal thinkin it would *kill* me. I’m still laughing about it! I eat hotter stuff all the time.”\n\nIt turns out, Capsaicin occurs on their planet naturally, and Humans and ingest amounts that would constitute a War Crime in most territories. Intrigued, we produced a list of fairly common poisonous compounds, asking him if any looked familiar. What followed left us in awe.\n\n“Let’s see here. Sodium Chloride is a seasoning. Oxidane covers seventy percent of our planet and our chemical makeup is like...eighty percent? Oh, and we drink it. We drink ethanol for recreation…”\n\nThe list went on and on.\n\nGeorge clearly could see we were having a hard time believing him, so he produced a flask of liquid and a chemical analyzer. Apparently this was common for them. After checking a small sample with George’s analyzer, my own and one we...procured...from a nearby lab, we confirmed the substance was nearly eighty-eight percent ethanol. George then promptly poured a truly horrifying amount into a glass and drank it all.\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent, as George described it, playing ‘Feed It To The Human’ since the shocking realization of their resilience is so common that their species sees it as a sort of game. I am attaching a full bioscan and database on them and their culture, but needless to say the amount of toxins I watched him ingest, along with the sheer amount of ethanol he drank freely the entire time, would be sufficient to kill several modestly sized moon colonies. Sure enough, the following day, George was still alive but complaining of what he called a ‘Four Alarm Hangover’.\n\nI advise the Clans to immediately establish formal diplomatic ties and enter into a mutual defense treaty as soon as possible. Simply put, if Humans ability to consume and survive some of powerful known toxins doesn’t concern you, then I advise you to look at page two hundred forty one of the attached and note the naturally evolved gland they possess that secretes a known illegal Combat Drug directly into their bloodstream.\n\nGet them on our side. Now.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKath GutangaAmbassador to the Grokex Hordes",

An atom has a nucleus and an electron cloud. The nucleus has both protons and neutrons, and the number of protons determines what element it is. So hydrogen, by definition, has one proton. If you add a proton, it becomes helium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA chemistry student decides that the names of ~~chemicals~~ elements (god I'm a senior chem major I am deeply ashamed) are dumb. Who needs to remember \"Oxygen\" or \"Hydrogen\" when you could just name the elements by the number of protons it has? So they posted a periodic table with new abbreviations, so \"H\" = hydrogen becomes \"O\" = oneium, since hydrogen has one proton.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/zmi4vk/comment/j0b3y3l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\> Wheres the fun in that :(\n\n\\> >  OP: Way more fun because the name of the element means something and you can actually get a sense of how big that molecule is/what it looks like. For ex. H2O would now be O2E and you can imagine oh, two ones, and one eight!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[In another thread, OP gets conspiratorial and someone else gets salty (ElZv)](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/zmi4vk/comment/j0bfzvi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\> Maybe dumbest post ever, congrats\n\n\\>> OP: says the guy who memorizes random names that mean nothing lmao. you just want to keep it the way it is because it creates more obstacles for people trying to learn chemistry. and you don't like that because more knowledge to the ppl means less power to you.\n\n\\> > > I’m sorry you haven’t had a good chemistry teacher yet\n\n\\> > > > OP: Nah I have actually, I’m just tired of hearing the words sodium chloride for ex. Like those words don’t mean anything. NaCl means more but ElZv is so soothing to my brain, it’s like everything’s in order now\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Someone else points out that their method is actually pretty complicated and confusing, and also in English](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/zmi4vk/comment/j0bbt3j/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\\> > OP: Well either we abolish the english names, Ex. Hydrogen Oxide being One 2 Eightide because that could mean O2E (H2O) or OTE (HHeO) and call them by their formula names or develop a new name for the corresponding letter number.\n\n\\> > > I mean, you probably see the Problem with \"One 2 Eightide\" yourself... By modifying the name, you gain nothing, still have to learn them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe chemists are generally pretty sympathetic to OP's struggles to learn the elements, which some students are unfortunately forced to memorize. However, everyone commenting seems to believe that their periodic table is not a good solution, to OP's chagrin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: phrasing\n\nEdit: there's more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\"Cast-twentysixium pans\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/zmi4vk/comment/j0dbtvq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\"Just give them names like (C)arl, (Br)ian, (Lu)cy...\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/zmi4vk/comment/j0b4570/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThis is ongoing, look into the post for even more",

You can find little Easter eggs between languages. In English nitrogen is named for nitre aka saltpeter, but in Dutch and German it's named for being suffocating. Oxygen is named in multiple languages after the mistaken idea that it was the key component making something an acid. And many elements, especially metals, already had names as commonly used or traded materials at the time it was determined that they are pure elements.\n\nAnyway, OP's system is roughly what we do with new synthetic elements, I believe ununoctium is the most recent. The names sound stupid and are easy to mix up and it really only flies because no one is actually doing chemistry with those elements because they have lifetimes of about a microsecond. It might work out okay if we had a library of like 10-20, but good luck coming up with a legible system of symbology up to a minimum of 82.

    "body": "**\\[WP\\] A pamphlet from an embassy titled \"Ten things to know before hiring a Human army.\"**\n\nVannix activated the newsviewer and accessed the latest feed. His primary and secondary antennae drooped as he assimilated the databurst. Far from dying away, the revolutionary cause was gaining more and more conscripts to its ranks every solar cycle. The war—unexpected on one side, meticulously planned out on the other—was going badly for those who merely wished peace and harmony with one another. \n\nIronically, it was the military—or rather, one particular colonel—around which the revolution had formed, over some half-conceived notion that they were going to be phased out. This wasn't true. Vannix had checked. But now, if the desperate measures he was planning on paid out, there would definitely need to be checks and balances put in place to prevent it from recurring. \n\nHe switched channels to a pamphlet that had been sent in response to a request for information about hiring mercenaries. He'd sent the request to every alien embassy in the capital, but only the Terrans had replied. Calling it up now, he began to read carefully.\n\n# HIRING HUMAN SOLDIERS\n\n*Important facts to know*\n\n1. Humans are not robots. Their comfortable temperature range is between the freezing point of water**^(1)** and forty percent toward the boiling point of water.\n2. Humans need sleep. Approximately one third of any given period of time is taken up by humans voluntarily lapsing into a state of unconsciousness**^(2)**. This is harmless as they will recover on their own. Medical attention is not required. Arrange shifts accordingly.\n3. Humans will ingest an astonishingly wide variety of food, and imbibe virtually anything that can be bottled (even if it should not have been). They are particularly fond of putting seasonings such as salt**^(3)**, capsaicin**^(4)**, sugar**^(5)** and alcohol**^(6)** in their food and drink. Do not ingest human food without having it tested first.\n4. When under combat stress, humans naturally secrete the controlled combat enhancement drug epinephrine**^(7)** (also known to humans as 'adrenaline', from the placement of the organ that secretes it). They also have it in injectable form *in case they need more*.\n5. Humans will pack-bond with any sentient species that pays them any sort of attention. Some have been known to pack-bond with their weapons and tools**^(8)**. If a human pack-bonds with you, then you have a loyal comrade for life.\n6. Humans can register sexual attraction to virtually any species that looks even vaguely humanoid and bears some level of resemblance to their preferred gender**^(9)**. Drunk humans lack the filters that sober humans possess. If you get drunk with a human who has praised any part of your body, be prepared to wake up in a compromising position.\n7. Humans do not have a warrior caste. Any human can learn how to fight and kill**^(10)**. The more experienced ones are good at it; the newbies are just enthusiastic.\n8. Over their history, humans have invented a staggering variety of weapons**^(11)**, some of which look like the result of someone losing a wager. Their soldiers are very, very good with their weapons of choice.\n9. Humans have been doing war for a very long time now. They are extremely good at it. So much so that they have evolved a series of rules**^(12)** to regulate how they do things. If a human soldier refuses to execute prisoners or perform some other \"atrocity\", it's a good idea to go along with it. You want to keep humans on side.\n10. Humans do not fight for honour or glory or the right to mate. Or rather, they do that in their downtime, for fun**^(13)**. When humans go to war, they fight to win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**^(1)** Water (H2O or dihydrogen monoxide), a free liquid on human worlds, is known to cause oxidation, especially in ferrous metals. Humans bathe in it and drink it on a regular basis.\n\n**^(2)** This is a genuine physical and physiological need. Preventing humans from getting their daily ration of sleep can be dangerous to both the human and yourself.\n\n**^(3)** Sodium chloride. Only toxic to some species. Humans have oceans full of it. Which they swim in.\n\n**^(4)** They say it adds spice. Do not ingest spicy Terran food, even as a bet.\n\n**^(5)** An energy source, but humans ingest it in quantities that should by rights be able to lift a satellite into orbit. Do not ingest Terran sweet pastries or 'energy drinks' if you wish to remain sober and sensible.\n\n**^(6)** Usually ethanol. Humans treat this as a recreational drink. They can ingest even a one percent solution without significant impairment. Do not try this if you are not human.\n\n**^(7)** Taking this drug into your body carries the chance that you will become an unstoppable frenzied killing machine, then your heart(s) will explode and you will die.\n\n**^(8)** Do not mess with anything that a human has pack-bonded with. The results will be unpleasant.\n\n**^(9)** There is a growing amount of anecdotal evidence to support the idea that some species reciprocate this attraction. Most military commanders have the \"I don't even want to know\" attitude.\n\n**^(10)** A major human youth organisation had its roots in a proposed paramilitary force. This explains so much about humans.\n\n**^(11)** If they run out of ammunition, lose their weapon or didn't have one to start with, humans are terrifyingly adept at using an unloaded or broken ranged weapon in melee, or even improvising weapons out of ordinary items. There is even a regimen of training, affordable to non-soldiers, that trains them to fight effectively without weapons. Never assume a human is unarmed or harmless.\n\n**^(12)** These rules are not there to protect humans. These rules are there to protect everyone *from* humans. Trust me, you do not wish to get into a cycle of escalation with humans. It never ends well.\n\n**^(13)** For a very specific definition of 'fun'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving read this, do you still wish to hire human mercenaries?\n\n**\\[ACCEPT\\] \\[DECLINE\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVannix took a deep breath. Every instinct he had told him that whichever way he went, the repercussions would be long-running and unpleasant.\n\nOf course, in only one of the two instances would he still be around to experience the consequences.\n\nReaching out, with the sense of someone tossing the first pebble that starts an avalanche, he tapped 'Accept'.",

My mother and aunt began SALTING their water.  I asked why and my cousin answers \"they don't like water.\" Both my cousin and I agreed that was weird, but then it got worse.  My mom decided to unscrew the cap of the salt shaker on the table and her and my aunt started POURING IT INTO THEIR WATER.  I said, \"What are you doing??\" and my mom's only response was \"potassium\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was dumbfounded.  As someone who only drinks water, it hit me that we couldn't be related.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Guys I KNOW salt is Sodium Chloride, you don’t have to keep telling me that",

So on days when I know there's no salt in any of my food, I sprinkle salt into my drinking water.\n\nPSA: humans only need 1500mg of salt per day which is less than half a teaspoon. Don't overdo it, and don't under-do it either.\n\nYour mom & aunt might be a bit under-educated on the matter of hydration by saying \"potassium,\" but potassium is one element of electrolytes, the others being SODIUM , magnesium, and sometimes sugar and calcium.",

    "body": "\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/vyoqiw/humans_are_cosmic_horrors/)\n\nClark was pretty sure he was dreaming at this point. Only a couple of hours ago he’d just been performing his duties as a humble cleanliness engineer. Scrubbing the floors, cleaning the toilets, the whole shebang. And now, he’d just had a pillow fight with an off-color Ewok. Only to then beat up two more for bullying the first one he'd met.\nAdmittedly it hadn’t been the first time he’d drop-kicked a Care Bear but at least this time he’d had a good enough excuse.\n\nAfter intercepting the distress signal they were only supposed to check if anyone on board needed help, as well as figure out which government they’d have to inform (and perhaps taunt a diplomatically acceptable amount). But now Clark feared he may have complicated things a little bit by potentially mucking up a first-contact scenario. One might argue that beating up two out of three aliens might have set a bad precedent, then again perhaps it wouldn’t be too bad of an idea for humanity to not set the bar too high for themselves. At least the one he saved seemed amicable enough, if perhaps a little strange. Truthfully, Clark was secretly hoping everyone else was faring about as well as he was in regards to interacting with these creatures. That way he wouldn’t have to feel too bad about choosing violence so recklessly.\n\nHell he might actually get his wish fulfilled. Stella had just contacted him regarding a certain kerfuffle going down at where they’d assumed the bridge was. He would have loved to stay with his new alien friend but unfortunately Stella could get ‘unpleasant’ when people tried to tactically evade her too often. And so with a deep sigh and after rubbing the sleep out of his eyes he got up, waved his new friend goodbye and headed out to go do his job. Cleaning up other people’s messes.\n\nIt didn’t take long for him to reach his colleagues, only to be met by the sight of 2 of them trying to kick down one of those futuristic looking, sideways sliding doors. While from the other side he heard what sounded like muffled bear-like grunts and squeaks.\n“Okay I’m here what’s going o-… wait, where’s Marshal.” Clark asked to which he practically immediately got his answer as a loud thud could be heard coming from the surprisingly spacious vent above him. Followed by a heavily accented: “Ouch, fuck ‘n shite.”\n\n“Quick lend us a hand here will ya.” Stella loudly demanded. ” It appears these … whatever they are, are trapped and are becoming increasingly anxious. We need to rescue them as soon as possible before something bad happens. Poor widdle fluffles, they sound like they might die from fear any second now. DON’T WORRY DARLINGS MOMMA’S COMMIN!!”\nShe roared before kicking the door as hard as she could.\n\n“As you’ve no doubt noticed we’ve already send our resident doctor and disappointed father figure into the vents to try and unlock it from the other side.” Stella informed him with a surprisingly calm tone of voice and composed demeanor, which after her previous outburst made Clark’s head spin.\n\n“Um should I be worried?” He asked while standing behind some debris and keeping reasonable distance between himself and his friends, who management had dubbed “the uninsurables”.\n\n“Nah not really, they seem very sturdy and probably haven’t seen that much wear and tear yet anyways.”\n\n“I meant Marshal.” Clark annoyedly added.\n‘That’s our Stella alright, more concerned about the ship she’s on than her own colleagues. Then again usually the only thing standing between a human and the dark cold vacuum of space is often a ship so perhaps such a mindset wasn’t entirely unreasonable.’ Clark thought to himself.\n\nSuddenly various loud bangs could be heard from the direction of the vent at which point the fuzzy little bear-creatures seemed to quiet down and relax a bit.\n\n“Um … guys, they’re all staring at me. What do I do!?” Marshal yelled through gritted teeth from behind the bridge’s vent. He refused to look away in case the little bastards decided to bumrush him.\n\nNot even a few seconds later one of the aliens seemed to yell something. It seemed scared, an emotion that had undoubtedly claimed hold of all of the room’s occupants and who’s control was now growing ever so rapidly.\n\nLike a room full of contractor’s who’s pay had been withheld for a month too long, they all collectively began to tear down the large pile of shiny space-machinery. They made quick work of the makeshift barricade after which they streamed out of the room like a flood of fluff and fright. Probably one of the more preferable floods one might find out in the cold vast nothingness of space. Various emotions washed over the humans, nervousness, cute-aggression, confusion and of course the ever so common ‘urge to administer a very enthusiastic and memorable colonoscopy’ to whomever had decided to design the vents in such a way that they’d be just big enough for a human to fit into.\n\nThe Enoweians frantically ran past them and if it hadn’t been for Jeremiah and Clark restraining her, Stella would have probably managed to grab one of the little buggers, after which she’d have undoubtedly mothered it to death. All the various dolls she’d vivisected, melted and/or “splatted” as a kid could attest to that. Then again, if those Pixar movies were anything to go by, they most definitely couldn’t.\n\nShe huffed and softly cursed under her breath as the teddy-bear like aliens ran past them before disappearing into the distance.\n\nStella’s not a bad person or anything. She’s just been blessed with the general tact and grace of a silver-back gorilla holding a hand grenade.\nShe tends to be a little too excitable and has a strange affinity for breaking the things she touches, qualities not entirely sought after in an engineer but at least she balances out her destructive nature with sheer talent and stubborn headedness.\n\nNot even two seconds after the fuzzy teddy-bear-like creature’s cries and shouts had fizzled out in the distance or yet another hairy and unintelligible creature had sought fit to voice his displeasure regarding his current predicament. This strange inhuman creature was of course one of the crews resident doctors, Marshal.\nA man commonly know for being as pleasant and patient as a kitchen timer taped to a hydraulic press. He claims to have found a loophole in the hippocratic oath and we all suspect that his medical license may be more theoretical than the tangible variety most physicians claim ownership off. Once one of the cooks asked him if he was actually qualified to treat people. To which he let out an amused snort before hurriedly walking away from the conversation, mumbling something to himself involving the word ‘people’.\n\n“Um here you go sir.” Jeremiah the last of my “friends” said to Marshal before helping him get back into his space-suit. Jeremiah’s a polite young man, or well more accurately he’s an intern and so sucking up is practically part of his ‘not-an-actual-job’ description. On one hand he’s a hard and kind worker, he always runs errands and gets us drinks whenever people tell him to. But on the other he’s got this annoying habit of never being around when you need him.\n\n“So um, should we maybe, retreat to our vessel and document our findings? I’m pretty sure the captain would want us to report that we’ve found alien life as soon as possible. What’s more I’m pretty certain we’ve already broken countless protocols so I reckon it would behoove us to keep our heads down and await further orders.” Jeremiah suggested politely.\n\n“Yeah, sure why not. After all I’m pretty sure Stella can only carry back so many alien-doohickeys. Ain’t that right ya grubby thief!?”\n\nMarshal yelled accusatorily while looking at Stella who was now frantically rummaging through a pile of alien machinery that not even a minute ago had been a makeshift barricade.\n\nOur suits didn’t exactly have much in the way of pocket space, a problem Stella easily circumnavigated by simply opening up her suit and dumping the various alien devices directly into it. Apparently she’s been looting the ship ever since we’d boarded and now after practically shoving an entire barricade worth of shiny new tech into her suit her kleptomania had become painfully apparent. At this point her suit was bursting at the seams making her look like a bulbous humanoid mass of excitement and gleeful mischief.\n\nAfter having just escaped a brush with death the startled Enoweians managed to regroup in what was essentially a large supply closet. This time making sure to cover the vents (and any other opening however small with stray pieces of cloth. Figuring that Gaian’s vision was probably based on movement. Once their super secret blanket fort had been secured they began to chat among themselves.\n\n“Good thing we’ve got the captain with us. If we hadn’t followed his advice most if not all of us would have been dead by now.”\n\n“Yeah they couldn’t even touch us, and not for a like of trying mind you.”\n\n“Did you see how big they were? Even Maltik barely reached the short one’s chin.”\n\n“Yeah the one with the ‘head-tail’ and ‘chest bumps’ looked ravenous. I was sure it was gonna eat me.”\n\n“And what about the one in the vents I was sure it was gonna jump out and spit acid at us or something.”\n\n“Pffft that’s nothing.” Gallyth remarked. “That heavy chested one actually managed to cut me with one of her talons.” he said while rolling up his sleeve to show off the minuscule cut he’d gotten from Stella’s fingernail gently brushing against his upper arm.\n\n“I think I saw a documentary about Gaia once and I’m pretty sure that surviving an attack like that practically makes me an honorary part of their pack.” he said arrogantly while the other Enoweians rolled their eyes and looked at him as if he’d just farted through his mouth.\n\n“Pfft you mean the one they show every year during the harvest festival?! All of that’s just fear mongering and imaginative guesses. For example everyone knows that Florigators aren’t real, not even on Gaia, and don’t even get me started on that whole ‘sea of sodium chloride’ bullshit.” All pure believer ought to only watch proper church-approved media, won’t rot your brain as much.\n\n“Yeah right,” retorted Gallyth. “Their theories are just as baseless and outlandish. Like how Gaians can apparently fire up to half a liter of gastric acid from their mouth when threatened. And well … did you see anyone melt a minute ago?”\n\n“Well no but… … um Gallyth, are you okay. You look pale and you’ve been panting for a while now.” Gallyth  argumentative rival asked concernedly.\n\n“Oh um yeah don’t worry. I just um, I just think I gotta lay down for a little bit. Don’t worry, it’ll take more than a Gaian attack to keep me down.” Gallyth tried to ease his contemporary's fears before loudly coughing.\n\nHe tried to gently lower himself onto the ground but found that most of his strength had already left him, and so with a hollow thud, fell to the ground helplessly. While starring upwards Gallyth could see all his fellow Enoweians crowd around him. Their expressions had become deformed with concern and fear.\n\n“It must have been those Gaian’s, they sucked out his soul.”\n\n“No it’s that scratch, they must have poisoned him. His insides are probably turning to soup as we speak.”\n\n“DON’T BE DIM!” The captain yelled at the murmuring crowd while pushing past a couple engineers to get to Gallyth. He grabbed his arm and knowingly nodded. “Yup, it’s just as I'd feared.”\n\n“Do you know what this is captain?”\n\n“Ay lad, only seen it a couple times before though I’d recognize it anywhere. My mother-in-law was a priestess who specialized in exorcisms after all. You see young Gallyth here …” The captain paused for dramatic effect “has been cursed by the Gaian’s vile soul magic.” The crowd gasped.\n\n“So … is … is he gonna die?”\n\n“Ay, or worse. You see if Gallyth manages to cling on to life for more than 12 hours after the initial scratch he will start to feel his body twitch and shake as it grows increasingly hotter. His limbs will grow rapidly to disproportionate sizes. It will feel as if bugs are wriggling beneath his skin. He will sprout fangs, horns and claws. And then…”  Once again the foolish captain paused for dramatic effect “He will turn into one of them!”\n\nThe crowd gasped.\n\n“He’ll eat us!”\n\n“He’ll turn us into Gaians too!”\n\n“Maybe we should… you know.”\n\nGallyth could barely hear anything as his body continued to be at the mercy of this strange Gaian influence.\n\nIt was like torture, pain dulled his senses, he felt oh so tired but he knew that if he fell asleep now he might not wake up again.\n\n“Don’t worry everyone.” The captain bellowed. “We need not resort to such … extreme methods just yet. There is one way to rid young Gallyth of this curse…”\n\n“We need to kill the creature that did this to him!”\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/x2y04n/humans_are_cosmic_horrors_part_8/)\n\n[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wra4xj/humans_are_cosmic_horrors_part_6/)",

And he was still in this tiny office and living space.\n\nAmbassador Patrick MacDonald stretched out on the floor rug he’d had fabricated, once he figured out how to put Terran templates into his Collective issued fabricator. He felt utterly caged in his quarters. It was the only place that felt right. The Collective Standard Gravity felt like he was back on Mars and he’d never liked being there for long. Sure it was good for a thrill, but all your reactions were timed wrong.\n\nAnd he was sick of dealing with the so-called “more aggressive” Collective species. They were little more than classroom bullies who couldn’t stand up to anything real.\n\nAt least the Borlians seemed to regard him favorably. But they were still just about as scared of his ‘accidents’ as most of the other species were. It didn’t seem to make sense that they wouldn’t have beefed things up, given the species’ general fragility. He’d even torn a few bolts out of a wall accidentally.\n\nThe little Trygn, what was his name, oh yes, Jaksyx. It seemed like he was always having to order more pieces for equipment that BigMac had managed to break, mostly out of sheer habit of not having to handle everything like it's the Empress’ china. He did like the little Trygn. Something of a quad-armed, three eyed slug that rode around on a gravpad.\n\nOf course, he’d also seen Jaksyx look nervously at the sodium chloride container BigMac had sitting with the rest of his spices.\n\nAn alert sounded on his console and reluctantly, he got up and walked over to it. It was a commlink from Terra. He couldn’t turn it down. So he tabbed it open.\n\n“You’re on the air,” he said jovially.\n\nAnother nameless analyst’s face, a younger male with tight features and close cropped hair, showed no reaction.\n\n“Your request has been fulfilled and is enroute. You may wish to alert the station. They will most likely become quite… excitable when it arrives,” the analyst said blankly.\n\nBigMac blinked a few times.\n\n“Wait. Really?” he asked, almost disbelieving.\n\n“Yes. Really. As it turns out, it was approved a while back, but the necessary transport equipment was unavailable.”\n\n“Do they have the placement plan?” BigMac asked.\n\n“I did that particular work myself,” said the analyst, a small smile invading his face for a brief moment. “The Collective it seems has the prime location for that system, but there are positions one lightsecond in the same orbit which should allow for many of the same benefits.”\n\n“Splendid. How soon will it arrive?” BigMac asked, leaning towards the screen.\n\n“Within the day, so I would recommend speaking with the station leadership post-haste. Terra out.”\n\nThe window holding the analyst’s face closed.\n\nBigMac sat for a moment in his ambassadorial chair. Finally, he could get out of here. Remembering the admonishment by the analyst, but deciding to celebrate a little anyway, he pulled open his bottom left side drawer and extracted a mostly full bottle of amber liquid and a small glass. After pouring himself what was a finger to him, but probably a lethal dose to any other species on the platform, he replaced the bottle, took a long sip of the amber liquid and felt its warmth fill him.\n\nNo matter how good the fabricators got, there simply was no getting around an old-fashioned Terra-brewed scotch. And for an occasion such as this, it felt right to drink it.\n\n\\_\\_\n\n10 minutes later, he had donned his official vestments and began strolling to the appropriate set of lifts that would take him to Councilor Brrt’Ik’s chambers.\n\nIt was a fast walk for him, but he did still occasionally have to try to not step on or kick fellow beings.\n\nArriving at the Councilor’s chambers, he walked right in to the front office, the aide looking up from “her” desk.\n\n“Is Brrt’Ik in? I have news that concerns the station,” he stated.\n\n“The Councilor is out, but perhaps I can be of some aid,” came the fluted reply of the aide.\n\n“I need to make the station leadership aware of an arrival from Human space,” BigMac said, smiling a bit.\n\nThe aide looked at him oddly for a moment, with head cocked to one side. On the bird-like alien, it was rather amusing to look at.\n\n“I should not think that station leadership would be bothered by the arrival of a Human transport vessel,” the aide responded, still with her head cocked to one side.\n\n“It’s not the transport that concerns me. It’s the cargo,” BigMac said, flatly, but still unwilling to tip his hand.\n\n“We will prepare for all appropriate hazardous material protections,” the aide said, straightening her head, clearly believing she had the handle of the situation.\n\nBigMac sighed. These… people were just no fun.\n\n“Very well. But please make station leadership aware that the transport will be arriving within the next decicycle,” BigMac put forward.\n\n“I shall do this. Thank you for informing us to allow us to take the appropriate precautions,” the aide said, and returned to looking over items on her desk.\n\nBigMac wandered away, shaking his head a bit.\n\n\\_\\_\n\n4 hours and 37 minutes later, a warp gate opened 15 lightminutes from Station 1337.\n\nThe station monitors reported the gate and then reported the two massive objects that came through it.\n\nAutomated systems began to kick in and alarms began to sound as the two massive objects began a slow, but increasing velocity toward the station. The smaller of the two was half the volume of the station and the other was twenty times the volume of the station.\n\nThe station managers and sensor operators started to panic as they saw the sensor returns filling their screens. Both objects were coming back as almost solid iron-carbon composites.\n\nIt wasn’t for a minute or two that they realized that the smaller one was towing the larger one. But there wasn’t a species known that could easily build spacecraft of that magnitude and towing capacity.\n\nThe communications system began to chime with an incoming message.\n\nTO: Station Leadership, Station 1337, The Collective\n\nFROM: INS *Speaking Softly*, Captain Ishmael commanding\n\n“Her Imperial Majesty of the 3rd Sol Empire sends her regards and the first trade station and mobile embassy between our peoples. Please alert Ambassador MacDonald to our arrival.”\n\nMESSAGE ENDS\n\nThe station manager swallowed heavily as the light of the star illuminated the two massive objects. The ship, the INS *Speaking Softly*, was towing the even larger… platform was the only word that came to the station manager’s mind. It wasn’t elegant or geometric or even some semblance of symmetric, but all of that was overshadowed by the sheer size of it.\n\n“An...an… analysis. What sort of spectroscopy are we seeing?” he managed.\n\n“It comes back as solid metal, iron and carbon, but we’re seeing evidence that both the ship and the, uh, station are using fusion systems,” the sensor operator managed.\n\n“Alert Ambassador MacDonald. I want to know just what that… platform is doing here.”\n\n\\_\\_\n\n“That? I requested it,” BigMac responded to the station manager.\n\n“You WHAT?” the station manager shouted, an impressive feat, given the otherwise even tones required for Collective Standard.\n\n“I requested a proper embassy and a trade station be supplied. That way, I don’t keep breaking equipment on your station, and I can arrange for a much great supply of trade opportunities,” BigMac grinned.\n\nThe station manager paused. It was true, he had seen all the requisitions regarding the human. He was used to seeing damage, but he usually expected to see that it had come from the dangers of space or extreme circumstances, not everyday accidents and certainly not by casual body-strength alone. It might be worth it to get the human off the station. At least until The Collective would make up its mind about these humans. But one question still floated in his mind.\n\n“Where did your empire get the resources for such a station so fast?”\n\n“Oh, well, as it turns out, this station was due to be decommissioned. It was already built, but it needed some serious refurbishment and updating before they could bring it out here and even then, you need a serious tug or warship to move it around,” BigMac said, matter-of-factly.\n\nThe word…. The word ‘warship’ stuck in the station manager’s head like a knife. He glanced at the screen showing the INS *Speaking Softly* towing the humans’ station. Just looking at it at this distance made something inside him want to run and hide. He wasn’t sure what it was, but the very thought that just now, there was a human-built warship showing more engine power in simply towing a station that dwarfed his own than he’d seen as a mega-freighter pilot made him suddenly nervous.\n\n“If you’ll excuse me, Station Master, I need to go contact them and make sure they have everything in order,” BigMac said, waited a moment for confirmation, and terminated the link.\n\nThe station manager looked back at the screen showing the massive entities. ‘So this was humanity. They didn’t build it for this. They were planning to throw it away…’\n\nThe last line stuck in his head as he watched on as a small vessel broke from the INS Speaking Softly and headed for Bay 6.\n\n‘Maybe it isn’t too late to retire someplace far away from here,’ he thought, still trying to come to grips with just what these humans were.\n\n\\[[first](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/hl4uos/the_collective/)\\] \\[[previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/hmev9h/the_collective_part_4/)\\] \\[[next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/hoe6im/the_collective_part_6/)\\] \\[[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/the_collective)\\]",

    "body": "RAK and Roll/Shadows over Centris/Koa’s Conundrums\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sensation as the green scanner sweeps over his body from top to bottom is a mild tingling that he feels in his everything, even on his hair and clothing which is weird as hair doesn’t have nerves and clothes aren’t part of his actual body.\n\nHe had put his foot down and gotten both sisters to agree on a doctor to scan him before anything else happened. He was still upset so this was something that would come before anything else, no exceptions. Thankfully they were still apologetic enough to listen without protest and had come here, to Doctor Jehnni’s In and Out Day Clinic, a place to get a basic scan and a prescription for your drugs.\n\nDoctor Jehnni is a Tret woman with a touch of grey streaking through her otherwise night black hair. She’s dressed so casually he had to look down to make sure she wasn’t in fluffy slippers and the only nod she’s given to her profession as a doctor is her coat with nametag.\n\n“Good goddess. This is no Tret. Not even close. By the stars, how are you... no wait... it all fits together. Just like in the Primeval Planet series.”\n\n“So he’s definitely not a Tret?” Nitta asks as Nikka stares at the wireframe readout of Koa’s body. All over are small red lights to indicate something very, very different from a baseline Tret. Each read out is for a different system. The entire nervous system wireframe is red, as is digestion, respiration, muscular and epidermis. The skeleton is only mostly red.\n\n“He’s further from a Tret than you are young lady. The resemblance is skin deep at most. No, not even skin deep. He only looks like one, general features and colouration deep at most. His skin gives out an oil that evaporates quickly to help him cool down, it’s loaded with pheromones too. It’s why he smells like he’s in season.”\n\n“So he’s not in season?” Nikka asks.\n\n“Oh, he’s in season. From what I can tell, he’s definitely in season and shows signs of having been in season for a very, very long time. Perhaps since puberty.”\n\n“Yes, puberty to impotence is the human reproductive season.” Koa remarks and Doctor Jehnni stares at him for a few moments before shaking her head.\n\n“Your nervous system is backwards reinforced and is a cross section of evolution to higher life, the concentration of nerves in your fingers and hands should mean an incredible sense of touch. Your species evolved from major tool users.” Jehnni remarks as she looks over the wireframes. “What did your kind eat when evolving? Your digestive system is more akin to a blast furnace that uses acid instead of heat.”\n\n“Technically almost anything as long as it’s not too toxic or too sharp. But that’s what tasting and chewing are for.”  Koa supplies and she nods.\n\n“Yes, I suppose chewing glass would be dangerous for you. The pheromone content in your spit is even higher than that evaporating oil.”\n\n“It’s called sweat.” Koa remarks.\n\n“The sweat then, fine.” Jehnni asks before bringing up the wireframe with his organs clearly visible. “These two here, these are a pair of powerful filters for the blood, but they have strange glands on top that are loaded with powerful chemical cocktails.”\n\n“Those are the kidneys with adrenal glands. Are kidneys so odd?” Koa asks.\n\n“Generally it’s all done by the liver. Cannidor have kidneys. Generally only one, granted it’s half again the size of one of yours, but still just one, and no adrenal glands. What do those do?”\n\n“They produce adrenalin, sort of an emergency combat drug. It increases awareness and reaction times while dulling pain and letting me use much more of the power in my muscles.”\n\n“So you naturally produce a combat stimulant that makes you faster, stronger, immune to pain and have incredible reflexes.” Doctor Jehnni remarks before squinting at the wireframe. “From what I can see you got a burst from them not too long ago. What happened?”\n\nBehind the good doctor both sisters flinch hard at the memory.\n\n“A misunderstanding spilled over into a terribly bad idea. So I put my foot down and here we are to make sure there are no more such silliness.” Koa explains carefully. “So now we’re going with the Koa rules. If you’re not sure about something you figure it out for sure, no more assumptions. Secondly, if you’re bad at something you work on it until you get better.”\n\n“What happened to make you put your foot down?”\n\n“Something I’ll be holding over their heads for a long time if they don’t get it through their heads that they need to use their heads.” Koa says giving them both a hard look.\n\n“I said I was sorry...” Nitta mutters.\n\n“We moved past the point of sorry. That’s why we’re here.” Koa answers. “Doctor, could you please continue explaining all the way’s I’m not a Tret?”\n\n“If a Tret had a quarter of the acid that’s in your stomach in theirs they’d be dead. Your bones show some signs of tiny amounts of cracking and abuse, there are heavy calluses on the hands and a fair amount of scarring. You’ve had a very rough life.”\n\n“What are you talking about? I’ve had a fairly normal life.” Koa protests.\n\n“Most men have few if any scars around your age. Though from what I’ve read it’s very rough and tumble in Cruel Space.”\n\n“It was fine. I mean the first few times I saw a volcanic eruption were kind of spooky but afterwards it became just a bit more entertainment. The occasional outbreak of disease was an almost existential scare, but we got through those fine. Shark attacks were mostly due to tourists being too stupid to look out for the beasts in the perfectly clear water, and... yea, normal. Boring.”\n\n“What’s a shark?” Nikka asks in a shocked tone.\n\n“Sharks are an entire species of seagoing predators, most of them have hundreds of sharp teeth, very nasty if they take a bite out of you. Thankfully they tend to not like the taste of human, so they usually spit out whoever was dumb enough to let themselves get bit.” Koa remarks as Doctor Jehnni compiles all the data together onto a chit and hands it to him.\n\n“You don’t seem hurt. I don’t know enough about your race to establish more than a basic bill of health. You seem to have the most over the top resilient and redundantly backed up body I’ve ever seen. A trait of living in Cruel Space I’d wager.”\n\n“Effectively, we have to work at peak efficiency with or without Axiom.” Koa answers and she nods.\n\n“Yes, I’ve actually got something here of interest.” Doctor Jehnni remarks before bringing up a wireframe focused on his head. “I did notice something interesting.”\n\n“Is this about the brain? The further to the back you go the more primitive and higher priority it has in brief.” Koa explains and she shakes her head.\n\n“While interesting, I’m actually looking at the tongue.”\n\n“The tongue?”\n\n“It’s wired up in a way that suggests a very sensitive sense of taste.”\n\n“Excuse me? We eat things that can and have killed other races. I have a shaker full of seasonings because normal food just doesn’t have the amount of taste I’m used to.” Koa protests and she raises an eyebrow.\n\n“It’s here! Is this dangerous for him to eat? The scanners say it’s all deadly poison!” Nikka asks handing Koa’s camping shaker to the doctor who scans it all.\n\n“For him it’s fine.” Jehnni mutters. “It would kill all three of us. But it’s fine for him, not the healthiest. But none of it would cause him real harm. It’ll play merry havoc with his taste buds, but from how robust his digestive system is he’d just pass all of this without much more than a stomach ache.”\n\n“So it’s bad for him?”\n\n“If he eats everything in the shaker in one sitting, but if he’s just sprinkling things with it then it’s perfectly fine.” Doctor Jehnni explains.\n\n“To be fair it would taste so horrible like that. I mean, eating ground cayenne straight? No thank you.” Koa remarks. “A touch of salt and pepper can make anything taste great.”\n\n“Sodium Chloride, ground pain kernels, several types of straight poison, your seasonings are a scary list of ingredients.”\n\n“I keep it well away from anything I cook. But are you sure I have more taste buds than other races? Their food is so plain and unfulfilling.”\n\n“Yours are likely directed towards certain tastes in certain quantities. I’m guessing your world has heavy duty competitive evolution right?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well in that case a lot of food will be at least mildly poisonous to ward off predation. Growing used to those poisons and learning which ones mean a better meal is a survival trait. No doubt there are some things that you’d back away from eating no matter the circumstances.”\n\n“Sure, tainted, rancid or rotting food is a no go. Most rough grasses and flowers are fairly bad. The wood of trees is too tough. Things like that.” Koa says and Jehnni nods.\n\n“That’s it exactly. You’re so used to the dangers of your home world that your sense of taste and smell are keyed into those, but without the fight that you’re used to most of our food tastes rather plain. Although there’s probably some areas where the food still tastes fairly good.”\n\n“Most meat products are good if properly prepared, fruits and sweets are alright. But vegetables and things that need a lot of cooking are generally fairly plain. And considering that my kind eat cooked meat almost exclusively it’s like frying out the flavour at times. So many races want their steaks as charcoal bricks that I can barely understand it.”\n\n“Most omnivores don’t like their meat bloody.” Jehnni remarks.\n\n“Fair, but boring. Overcook and you may as well be eating boot leather.”\n\n“Undercook and we can grow sick.”\n\n“With some meats it’s the same for my kind. But the ones you can eat raw... the ones you can sink your teeth into and taste that bit of life...” Koa licks his lips at the thought.\n\n“Hungry?”\n\n“Pining for a steak. A slab of thick meat with both sides having salt and pepper seared into them, some fried veggies on the side and a roast potato with sour cream and chives. It’s a treat. Granted you call pepper pain kernels so I think I’m the only one here who’d like it.”\n\n“Doctor?” Nikka asks.\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Is there anything we should know about that might get him hurt? Is everything that’s safe for a Tret safe for him?” She asks and Doctor Jehnni considers the question before turning back to the wireframes and then looking through a readout.\n\n“He needs a lot more water than any Tret alive. Two times as much in the average day. He also needs to eat half again as much to maintain all these extra organs, although from what I can tell he’s already eating plenty to maintain his physique.”\n\n“He likes to do the cooking, he always eats more than me and Nitta together.” Nikka says before considering and then nodding to herself then to Nitta.\n\n“That’s about enough, now... oh. Excuse me.” Jehnni remarks as she steps out of the way of the sisters who solemnly walk up to Koa and look up at him with shimmering eyes.\n\n“If you think...”\n\n“We’re sorry!” They wail as one and latch onto his thighs to bury their faces and sob into his waist.\n\n“Uh...” Koa begins before looking to Jehnni with a baffled expression as she giggles.\n\n“You’re the one married to drama queens. How did you not see this coming?” Jehnni asks as Nikka and Nitta blubber into him, climbing up then burying their faces into his shoulders.\n\n“This is clearly planned. They don’t normally plan this.” Koa says over the sobs.\n\n“I... I was thinking hard since you got angry that we’d need to both say we’re sorry and, and we are! We were saying you were something you weren’t and we were wrong each time! It was wrong and... and... were you being honest when you said humans come from Cruel Space?” Nitta explains between sobs before seemingly startling herself out of crying.\n\n“The planet Earth in the Sol system, which is deep inside Cruel Space, yes.” Koa answers.\n\n“And there are just as many men as women?” Nikka asks.\n\n“One hundred to one hundred is the ratio. I don’t know the specifics as to what makes us different in that regard, but I do know that men come out as often as women. The hows and why’s I don’t know.” Koa says.\n\n“And you said something about seeing volcanoes erupt. Is Earth a burning volcano world?” Nikka presses and he shakes his head.\n\n“No, but the part I lived on has a few active volcanoes. I’m Hawaiian, meaning I trace my ancestors back to a chain of small tropical islands with several active volcanoes. I grew up there as well, and there’s so much beauty to it that people from all over the world travel to vacation on our little island paradise.”\n\n“What else is it like?” Nikka asks and he smiles. They’re asking questions and listening. Which means they’re going to start to grow. Good. That’s good.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/py3rnq/out_of_cruel_space_part_134/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/pzg5ho/out_of_cruel_space_part_136/)",

Also a bit of poking fun at just how varied the human diet is and how absolutely insane it would seem to the outside. I mean... we've got cheeses with live maggots in it. We've got fermented raw fish in some dishes. There's a Japanese dish that involves eating the fish alive, seal eyeballs are basically Eskimo candy. Deep Fried butter, mars bars and ice cream. We'll ferment and drink anything alcoholic. Our digestive tracts are either a blast furnace or a Non-Euclidian nightmare to other races and I didn't think it appropriate for the doctor to be driven mad by a glimpse into the uncaring insanity that is the potential human diet.\n\nAlso KamchatkasRevenge has the third part of his story up.

        "body": "I finally catch a chapter as it is posted and fresh! Time zones are a mess.\n\nI have some more unrelated questions/theories about the story!\n\nIn earlier chapters, we've seen Holly the Carrib. And her muscles were described as \"as strong as steel\". She did accidently broke Herbert's rib on chapter 114 with \"one panicked punch\". That's super strength.\n\nNow there's two things to notice here. One, that's more power than you can get with simple strongman training. Two, it's a significant different kind of superstrength than the one we genrally see in the galaxy. MiroNoir is also super strong, but not in a way that lets her survive in cruel space.\n\nSo I think that what happens here is some sort of indirect axiom effect. There's a thing in D&D (at least some editions of it) where if you cast \"fireball\" on a monster with spell resistance, the spell might not work. But if you cast \"acid dart\" at the same monster, it bypasses the monster's spell resistance, because the spell was to create acid, and to give the acid momentum. By the time it hits the monster it's just mundane acid. There's a whole list of tactics for wizards to use indirect conjuration spells to deal with spell resistant enemies.\n\nThis also means that theoretically, it opens up uses of axiom effects that can be carried over into null space. Which is a whole new bag of goodies to explore. And you know that no one else in the galaxy ever tried, because what's the point of asking \"what if we run out of axiom?\" when the entire galaxy is axiom? Only when axiom is a shiny new toy that you wonder what would happen if it was suddenly gone again.\n\nSomething like that could happen here. Like a conjuration effect with axiom. Somehow creating muscles that are not mere temporal shapeshifting. No doubt, Holly did her training, but perhaps the axiom helped build up her muscles gradually over time to levels that they wouldn't normally be. \n\nFor example, we do know that axiom can be used in healing comas. That's a safe and simple technology. But that doesn't mean that it's the only way for axiom healing to happen. If you train and damage your muscles, you need time for them to heal up. What if you use axiom to heal them faster? That means you cut out all of the dead resting time when you feel sore and need to wait for the next session (or move to a different muscle group, but you'll run out of those eventually!). Not only that, if you use axiom to tamper with the way that your muscles heal, that can explain how they become stronger than we normally think should be possible.\n\nI think that I had more fun with this idea than most others. It's taking one character we got to know recently, and trying to reverse engineer new powers from looking at her muscles and realizing that \"this is possible. now lets figure out how\".\n\nBut wait, there's more. Because exploiting the rules of reality is not a thing that you can stop and say \"That's enough\" to. If the whole proccess of training is causing certain type of damage to your muscles, and then healing them better. That means that theoretically, you don't need to really BE there when it happens. If some sort of axiom based technology can cause eficient damage to all of your muscles, and then put you through a healing coma to regenerate, and then just keep the proccess... you don't have to be concious for that. In fact, your mind can actually be uploaded like they do on a real healing coma while your body is being worked on.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Because mad science has no need for your little \"ethics\". We can go one step beyond. Clone yourself, but don't upload any memories to your clone. Put your clone in that training contraption to damange and heal muscles and make them as powerful as steel. You can keep it on and go do something else. (go read a side story about dogs that makes you feel good. God knows I'm not going to do that) Eventually when the body is \"ready\". you get in a healing coma yourself, upload your brain, and download it into the new improved body. And there! efficient null-supported superstrength. No shapeshifting or axiom skills included!\n\nNow all that's left to do is to dispose of your old body in an environmentally friendly way. Because like the diet soda that you order with your junk food, it helps you pretend that you have morals.",

        "body": "From a purely evolutionary perspective, humans are designed for pure survival. \nFemales are designed to create (high body drain), bear (monstrous body strain), and potentially rear (monumental emotional and physical strain), and protect young.\nMales are designed to protect the females through combat. Combat against other males, combat against predators, combat against the environment in securing food.\nThe sheer survival requirements come from a world that constantly is in competition. Predators and super predators (Apex humans may be, but we are still on the menu), plants developing poisons and toxins to ward predators (herbivores, omnivores, and insects), and even our herbivores are dangerous with their own defenses.

    "body": "The Bounty Hunters\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Excuse me.” A voice says partway through their dessert. Cindy and Gregory looks over to see the waitress look at them somewhat nervously.\n\n“May we help you?” Cindy asks. She had been slowly nibbling through her dessert and enjoying the cool fruity treat. Something that Gregory clearly enjoyed as well as he was eating a fair amount as well. Which was something of a relief to her, humans weren’t so much picky as they were choosy. A picky eater refuses to eat what they don’t like. A choosy one knows what they like and always go for that instead.\n\nUnfortunately humans like absurd doses of sodium chloride and numerous chemical weapons on their foods. Thankfully some areas like meats, fruits and other things that can be devoured raw are a fair bet. They also like their sweets and tend to take them by the bucket.\n\n“There is an additional bottle of Brunivl Wine at table fourteen that has been set aside for you both. If it would please you madam and sir to relocate and we can open the vintage for your drinking pleasure.”\n\n“That would be in the more isolated parts of the establishment. Well out of view to casual guests.” Gregory notes as Pukey starts going through the tactical situation. Things are going well, but the wine is clearly bait. But is it bait to look for an excuse to attack by claiming insult or a lure into a trap?\n\nIf all else fails he can do this Casino what he did to the last one. He’s even got the plasma sword to do it.\n\n“Shall we?” Cindy asks and he smiles.\n\n“It appears that outside forces seek to make decisions for us. I am by your side either way.” Gregory states grandly and Cindy titters.\n\n“We’ll replace your dessert at the table, on the house.” The waitress says graciously as she glances from Gregory to the case. Clearly she not only knows what’s in it but what can be done with it.\n\nCindy stands up and quickly finds Gregory’s hand in hers as he also picks up the case and they follow the waitress into the more secluded part of the restaurant.\n\nAt table fourteen there is the bottle of wine and flutes to drink it with as fresh copies of their dessert arrive just before they do. There are six places at the table and Gregory makes certain to sit with Cindy by his side. He gives her a quick two squeezes to let her know he smells danger.\n\nHe takes the first bite of his dessert and Cindy feeds him a spoonful of hers. “Just as good as what we left.” He assures her and she smiles in relief.\n\n“You don’t have to worry about poison. There are very few things on this station that would actually bring you harm, the ones for the Cannidor perhaps, but it’s uncertain.” A nearby voice says and Pukey’s eyes narrow as he spots a small impression in the cushioning of a nearby chair.\n\n“I hope to god you’re wealthy enough for the invisible clothing and not naked madam.” Pukey remarks to the Cloaken woman.\n\n“Already? I matched my Axiom to the background! How did you find me so quickly?”\n\n“The voice was hint enough, after that it was narrowing things down.” Pukey remarks. “May I ask why we’re having this little meeting?”\n\n“Straight to the point. You’re all business aren’t you?”\n\n“My business is violence, tactics and strategy. Failing any of the three will get myself, my men or someone I actually care about hurt.” Pukey answers tartly as he reaches out for the blue wine and uncorks it with his thumb aided by a touch of Axiom. He then catches the cork and takes a deep sniff with his sense of smell enhanced. “Clean as well, you are on the up and up.”\n\nHe pours both himself and Cindy a flute before forcing the cork back in with his fingers and raising his own glass as a toast to their invisible dinner guest.\n\n“My my... You and your men are everything our research claims you to be. I just want a conversation, perhaps even some business opportunities.” The Cloaken states and Pukey sighs. “Is something the matter?”\n\n“I’m trying to treat my wife to a wonderful night, just for her.”\n\n“I don’t mind Darling. She’s not being rude and she’s offered a gift in apology.”\n\n“Yes but this is your night. There shouldn’t be anything but what you want, for at least one night.” Gregory remarks and Cindy sighs in satisfaction.\n\n“Don’t worry darling. I’ve had the beginning and the middle. A little blip before the ending I’ve been promised won’t even be remembered.” Cindy answers and Gregory gives her a kiss on top of her head before turning his gaze to lock eyes with the invisible guest.\n\n“You want to talk, let’s talk.” Pukey says and there’s the sound of a throat clearing.\n\n“Alright then. It’s simple enough. I don’t want my casinos damaged, nor the businesses under my protection. Which is this entire sector. Keep your boys on a leash and I’ll do the same. I’m in the business of business and pointless pissing contests with random mercenaries with a penchant for overwhelming force and meticulous plans is not a fight that me or my associates walk away from unbloodied.”\n\n“I see, so generally a non-aggression pact?” Pukey asks and there’s no answer for a moment as he tries to adjust just how he perceives things in the Axiom. Giving up trying with his organic eye he starts going through the filters in his cybernetic one. Infrared, ultraviolet, and several other bandwidths aren’t showing him anything.\n\n“Oh I see... you can only see the impact I make.”\n\n“I can hear you as well. You’re being very, very still to not tip me off.” He remarks before finally giving up and focusing in his ears. He mentally regulates it to something out of a comic book and the world around him contorts as a new layer to his hearing opens up.\n\n“There we are. Or rather, there you are. Crossed legs, mouth slightly agape, long head feathers braided together with numerous bits of jewellery tied in.” Gregory remarks as the noise of the restaurant outlines the woman with the now dropping jaw.\n\n“How?”\n\n“Your eyes can deceive you, don’t trust them.” He quotes for the sake of confusion. “Did you know on The Dauntless, currently the political capital of The Undaunted, that the guards have made sport of catching and quite literally throwing out Cloaken spies? Apparently they compete for sheer distance in several leagues, singular and team, Axiom Enhanced and Non-Enhanced.”\n\nNow that everything is nice and muddied Pukey smiles to himself, and then withdraws a flask from his coat. The few stills on The Chainbreaker were not examples of good booze. They were however powerful alcohol refining plants. They had all they needed for almost any kind of flaming weapon. Or to up the alcohol content of the otherwise piss poor drinks. This flask was filled with the latter and was nearly tasteless, any stronger and it would count as medical grade.\n\nHe pours only a half finger in and swirls around the drink before tucking away the flask. The clear liquid has a borderline haze surrounding it and it refuses to dissolute into the wine properly leaving tiny clear bubbles of high proof alcohol in the otherwise mildly dry blue drink.\n\nHe grins as The Owner he’s talking to ruffles through her outfit and pulls out a scanner. This next bit should be entertaining. He can kind of make out the expressions on her face and hopefully they match up closely enough to humans to tell. He’ll have to ask Franklin if there’s anything odd in the species he should know about.\n\n“It’s just alcohol.” He remarks as the device unfolds and he reads the holographic display backwards as Cindy giggles. She can’t see the expression the Cloaken is making, but she can imagine it.\n\n“There’s enough in there to kill both myself and your wife.” The invisible woman states blankly.\n\n“Hence why I’m the only one drinking this.” Pukey remarks as he slowly drinks it down and licks his lips. “Thankfully we’ve got a formula that tends to enhance what it’s added to rather than making a mess out of it.”\n\n“That stuff is incredibly flammable.” The Cloaken says and Pukey grins as he refills the flute halfway, adds a touch of the alcohol. Then covers the top with his palm and shakes it up. A tiny bit of Axiom sparks the drink to catch on fire. He then salutes her with the flaming drink and then throws it back flame and all. He holds his breath and keeps his mouth completely closed to snuff out the fire before grinning.\n\n“You’re insane.” The Cloaken says and he snorts in amusement.\n\n“Let’s not pretend that all of us don't have something that will baffle and possible terrify the others.” Pukey says with a slight chuckle. “So just to make things clear, should we be attacked and find out that the person we’ve defended ourselves against is both someone we can make money on and is someone you’ve got under a paycheck or are collecting pay from?”\n\n“That depends on whom and just what you had to defend yourself against. If it’s your provoking them to give you an excuse and it’s one of my inner circle then I will blow your ship to shrapnel. ”\n\n“You hire people that stupid?”\n\n“I hire talent. Oftentimes talent comes with a reputation.” She says and Pukey grins.\n\n“Well that’s one bet I’ve won, Bike was so certain we had some competition.” He muses with a distinctly smug air.\n\n“You do. There are roughly fourteen different groups that are trying to bait in or outright kidnap criminals with bounties.”\n\n“And how do my men and myself compare?”\n\n“Relatively unknown, you’re new to the game, but what is known about you is actually rather scary. I suggest you calm down a little, or at least take more time before taking bounties unless you want a Black Bounty in your crew.” She says and Pukey nods.\n\n“I’ll take that as friendly advice. Thank you.” Pukey says with a nod.\n\n“I hope you’re as smart as you seem. I’ve had conversations like this several times in the past two months alone. At least two of the five teams decided to push and push until I had to... push back.” She remarks.\n\n“Understandable.”\n\n“It was the humans stationed here that discovered the corpses.”\n\n“Oh and no doubt you heard them telling horror stories about it for months straight and even now you can find them with looks of utter despair in their eyes.” Pukey says and rolls his eyes.\n\n“Something like that. Although to be frank after the first few times they cleaned up a dead body they grew very numb to it.”\n\n“We’re adaptive. Now, not to be rude, but unless you have more I’d like to get to more pleasant topics with my wife here.”\n\n“It’s so very odd that you act as if it’s your duty to protect her and not the other way around. The rumours of your race having things backwards between men and women are apparently true. Much like your absurd poison resistance. There had been a scare when those Tret looking boys decided to start buying all sorts of toxic ingredients from The Hivers.”\n\n“I believe it. So is there anything you especially want or...?”\n\n“So eager to pamper your wife, I’m married but interested. If only Jules was so smitten.”\n\n“It’s because they don’t expect it. It’s a little pattern I’ve overheard in their conversations. Apparently the girls back in Cruel Space are so spoiled for choice that they get PICKY.” Cindy remarks.\n\n“Really? Well, that’s their loss then. Speaking of loss, spending much more time here will be a loss of revenue on my part. Enjoy the rest of your evening you two, and Captain Schmidt?”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“Should we send you information on girls that owe a debt to our casino and refuse to pay, would you be willing to hunt them down?”\n\n“I’m afraid my crew and I want to be able to jump into the more legal parts of the galaxy at will. If someone’s pulling a runner then put up an official bounty. It shouldn’t be hard to push it through.”\n\n“Ah... obeying the letter of the law so you can have fun mocking the spirit. I can respect that. Again, enjoy the rest of the evening.” She says before vanishing entirely from Pukey’s senses. He relaxes with a smile.\n\n“Is everything alright?” Cindy asks and he nods even as he feels her fade back in some few steps away.\n\n“Of course, our gracious host over there has been most welcoming. We don’t have to worry.” He says gesturing towards the invisible woman that hasn’t fooled him in the slightest.\n\n“How does he do that?” He hears her mutter to herself as she walks away, glancing over her shoulder at him, undoubtedly concerned. He merely toasts her with another flute of mixed alcohol.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/q24h7i/out_of_cruel_space_part_140/?sort=top) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/q3hgs8/out_of_cruel_space_part_142/)",

I hope you like it.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\"Lieutenant Yamada, please, have a seat, make yourself comfortable\" said Captain Ir'4ta, with a wave of his tentacle, attempting to approximate a human gesture of welcome.  \"I am terribly sorry to have to discuss such a terrible situation with you, but as you are aware, I struggle to understand human cultures, and I want to be sure that this...difficult matter is handled appropriately.  Ketaran Law is quite clear on such matters, but as your species are not technically members of our alliance, I...hmm...what is your expression?\"  Ir'4ta paused for a moment, antennae wiggling back and forth in concentration, \"ah yes, I am walking a high tension cable.\"\n\n\nLieutenant Yamada's eyes sparkled, and the corner of her mouth turned up in a slight half-smile.  Ir'4ta had to admit, that for such an unusual species, their odd appearance was not entirely unpleasant.  Yamada had been assigned to his ship, the *Wayward Son* nearly three years ago, and while the Terran liaison officer did not fall under his command structure, and they had in fact become good friends, they still addressed each other by rank, out of mutual respect.  In fact, it was due in part to Ir'4ta's reports that Yamada had recently been promoted to First Lieutenant, though to be fair, she had earned it several times over, as far as Ir'4ta was concerned.  Hostile parties became much more...friendly...when they learned that a representative of the Terran Navy was on board.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it was because of Terrans that Ir'4ta was in the current mess.\n\n\n\"The expression you are looking for is 'walking a tightrope,' sir,\" smirked Yamada.  \"But I am not sure I understand.  Yes, I know there was a minor incident in the galley yesterday...\"\n\n\n\"Minor?\"  Ir'4ta interjected, the chromatophores in his skin turning various shades of green and purple in distress.  \"We had one human passenger attempt to murder another, who, when he challenged the first to combat, nearly maimed a representative of the Terran Navy!\"  Ir'4ta realized that he had begun pacing behind his desk, and took a deep breath to try to calm down before continuing.  \"Under Ketaran law, both individuals should be put to death for their vile and violent crimes, yet I am certain that, under the circumstances, the Terran Union would want to punish the second individual for attacking one of their representatives...\"  Ir'4ta paused, puzzled, as Lieutenant Yamada tried, and failed to stifle a giggle, which grew into a boisterous laugh.\n\n\n\"Lieutenant!  Did you suffer damage to your central nervous system when you were assaulted?  I can see that your ocular tissue was damaged in the assault, but do you think the damage was deeper?\"  Ir'4ta rushed to his friend's side, genuinely concerned, but Lieutenant Yamada waved him away, still trying to stifle her laughter.\n\n\nAfter a moment, she was able to collect herself, and spoke.  \"Sir, let me assure you, you don't have a crisis at hand.  This is really not a big deal.\"\n\n\n\"But Hanako, my crew recovered the poison!  The data logs recorded the entire situation!\"\n\n\n\"Sir, allow me to explain.  The first young man, Anders, was playing a practical joke on his brother, Frederick.  They got into a scuffle, and when I was trying to separate them, Frederick swung a little wild and gave me this little shiner,\" she said, pointing to her right eye.  \"The situation has been adequately resolved, and it really doesn't need to be addressed any further, and certainly not with capital punishment.  If anything, I'd suggest making them clean the galley until we make port on Karebela.  That would be punishment enough, I think.\"\n\n\nIr'4ta slumped back in his chair, deeply confused.  \"I will defer to your judgement on this--after all, I really do not want to cause any sort of diplomatic incident between our governments.\"  He paused, reaching to smooth a particularly jittery antenna.  \"I fail to see how attempting to poison another is practical, or funny, and I am amazed that attempted murder is treated so lightly among your species--I must have deeply misunderstood your culture.\"\n\n\nHanako laughed again.  \"Ah, that, I can explain.  While sodium chloride is a known toxin to several species in the Ketaran Alliance, it is actually essential to human biochemistry in small amounts, and is sometimes used to add flavor to our food.\"\n\n\n\"But certainly, even humans must be affected by large quantities of this chemical!\"\n\n\n\"The amount that Anders added to his brother's glass of milk was absolutely harmless to humans, but was enough to taste awful.  It was just a harmless prank.\n\nRemind me, sometime, to tell you about some of the pranks *my* brother and I played on each other when we were kids their age.  This is nothing, really.\"\n\n\nIr'4ta's skin flashed shades of green and purple again.  \"Later, perhaps.  I'm not sure I'm up to it right now.  Your people can be truly frightening, you know that, right?\"",

    "body": "Antlers, Assumptions and Artillery\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“It feels weird...” Holly complains before they leave. Her antlers had been trimmed down and rounded off; she was now being filed down to six shorter points, many of them nubs on each side rather than ten sharp spears. It had taken hours to file it all down and Bjorn had not been allowed to watch or even be in the same room, they weren’t really comfortable with him in the apartment so he took a folding chair, sat outside the door and read a book as he waited. There was a LOT of cultural baggage that just wasn’t being shared and that was fine. So long as it didn’t interfere with his actual job of keeping Holly safe she could indulge in any cultural practice she wanted, she was a Carib after all, being seen doing Carib things didn’t exactly expose her as the former host of Knifetop.\n\n“Well you only had two points on each side before this whole disaster started, being at six per side should feel closer to normal than that weapon rack of ten.” Bjorn remarks as he unlatches the door to its fullness and gets a good look at her. Her ENTIRE demeanour has changed, was she storing her freaking confidence in those antlers? She looks less dangerous and if he can get some pale brown or tan dye into her fur and some baggy clothes on her, then you’d need a dedicated scanner or detective to figure her out. “It’s a good look.”\n\nHolly starts to tear up and his jaw drops as Mother Clatterhooves glares at him. “Really, I thought you had more tact!”\n\n“Don’t you give me hell for not understanding the Carib things that have never been explained to me. Being ignorant is one thing, being kept in ignorance and then looked down for it is another.”\n\n“You wouldn’t understand.” Holly mutters.\n\n“Then don’t expect me to! If you’re not going to explain then I have no way of knowing what proper or improper things to say are. As far as I understand the antlers are some kind of status symbol that grows out of your head and channels Axiom for you. That is the extent of my knowledge.” Bjorn protests.\n\n“It’s more than that.” Mother Clatterhooves says.\n\n“How so?” He asks and both of them look away. He heaves a sigh of disgust. “Fine, keep your secrets. Now, you wanted to go out and have a meal right?”\n\n“Yes, there’s a Margarine’s nearby.” Mother Clatterhooves says. “We missed breakfast and I’m not in any mood to cook.”\n\n“I don’t know how to...” Holly mutters.\n\n“And neither of you will let me cook.” Bjorn grumps.\n\n“You think highly deadly poisons make a meal. If I could DNA lock you out of the kitchen I would.” Mother Clatterhooves scolds him and he scoffs in amusement.\n\n“Right, okay so we’re eating out. Let me grab some spare ammo and we can go.” He says brushing by them and quickly making his way to his room. He emerges a minute later with a jacket in addition to the jeans, t-shirt and boots and nods to them both.\n\n“I can sense you doing something with the Axiom, what...” Mother Clatterhooves begins and he pulls out a fully assembled rifle from inside his jacket in response. “I see. You really take this seriously don’t you?”\n\n“Well yes. Why shouldn’t I? I’m a soldier, I am Undaunted. You’re daughter is under my protection, so if an entire army descends upon her then I’ve got an entire army to grind under my boots. Now let’s get some food, I’ve heard about something called Lanwrack Steak that’s apparently a staple for meat eaters around the galaxy.”\n\n“Margarine’s should have it although they tend to be more of a breakfast chain. Carnivores do tend to have Lanwrack for every meal if they can get it.” Mother Clatterhooves remarks.\n\n“I keep forgetting humans are meat eaters.” Holly mutters.\n\n“Right well we need to get moving if your mother is going to get a meal in her before she has to leave.” Bjorn says as he leads them to the elevator and presses the button. The fact that so many things are so familiar is somewhat disappointing, although these ones are improved for basically going at warp speed with inertial dampeners stopping you from feeling anything.\n\nThey pile in and he has to crane his head to the side to avoid getting conked on the head by Mother Clatterhooves antlers.\n\n“Martha... Martha Clatterhooves.” He mutters to himself.\n\n“What?” She asks.\n\n“Sorry I... my mind almost entirely associates you with your daughter and your name sounds similar enough to Mother that when I think of you it’s Mother Clatterhooves and not Martha Clatterhooves. My apologies.” Bjorn says before the elevator door opens. The Nagasha woman waiting at the bottom is greeted to an abashed looking Bjorn and a laughing Holly and Martha.\n\n“Yes yes, I’m a tremendous goof. Can we go? Holly? Mother? Can we get a move on before Miss Nagasha here gets upset with us?” Bjorn asks and the group starts moving with Holly and Martha far from upset. It may have been due to a bit of a brain fart, but both women are much happier and that counts as at least a small win in his book.\n\nThe restaurant Margarine’s is very much a sort of homey kind of place that you could expect a stack of waffles and a plate of bacon any hour of the day. As they walk he slows down and gestures for them to lean close. “If anyone asks what my relation to you two is then I’m your son and Holly’s brother so you’ve both got reason to stick close to me. Okay?”\n\n“Only if you keep calling me Mother.” Martha teases.\n\n“Deal.” Bjorn says and both women giggle in response. Well, the problem of trimming Holly’s antlers has been pushed aside for now. Hopefully it’s not too stubborn a beast.\n\n“Hey there! Welcome to Margarine’s a single and a booth next to it?” The Drin waitress asks winking with the eyes on the left half of her face.\n\n“Family booth actually.” Martha says and the waitress doesn’t even blink.\n\n“Of course! Right this way please.” She says her many arms in a flurry of movement as she registers where they’re sitting for the automated systems in the restaurant and taps down a few incidental thing as she walks. Having six arms really lets a lady multi-task.\n\nThey’re led into a booth and handed menus, Bjorn flips through it quickly and finds what he’s looking for, lanwrack steak. Couple it with some fried tubers and a side salad and his lunch is looking great.\n\nThe waitress quickly swings by again and takes their orders. Apparently both Martha and Holly really wanted their late breakfast in opposition to Bjorn’s early lunch. He decides to make some small talk to relax things. “So mother, how do you expect the day at work to go?”\n\n“Oh not too bad, not too good either. Waste management is vital but not something that a lot of ladies want to talk about.” Martha says and Bjorn reassesses what he thought he knew about her. He had no idea she worked in the sewage department.\n\n“Too dirty a subject?” Holly teases.\n\n“Yes indeed. Thankfully the cleaning drones are easy to pilot and easy to clean. I never even breathe the same air as is what’s in the pipes, thank goodness.”\n\n“Saves on shampoo and showers at least.” Bjorn notes. “You ever have much fun with the drones? Make them fight each other or draw silly things?”\n\n“Oh not really, most of the girls in the office are pretty humourless and liable to snitch if they catch you enjoying yourself.”\n\n“Yeesh.” Bjorn grimaces then offers a smile to the waitress as she brings by the jug of water and glasses he had asked for.\n\n“Speaking of yeesh I noticed you drinking quite a bit.” Martha says before leaning in, Holly leans in too to listen in. “How much water do you humans need?”\n\n“A lot. The smell we give off? That takes up a lot of water. We also have a bunch of other organs that require their own nutrients and blood and such so fluids are in high demand.” Bjorn remarks. “Anything else?”\n\n“Does all the poison you eat really taste good to you?”\n\n“It tastes amazing. A lot of food we can take undressed and even enjoy them, but there are precious few dishes that can’t be improved with ground sodium chloride crystals and pain kernels, most of them being those that rely on being sweet like candies or pastries.”  Bjorn answers.\n\n“You didn’t bring any with you did you?”\n\n“Oh no, I left the camping shaker at the apartment.”\n\n“The what?”\n\n“A container with a sample of the most common spices humans use. Easy to transport and use to spice up any meal. It could also probably double as an instrument of torture with how sensitive you people are to such things.” He jokes.\n\n“It’s not funny, it’s strange! What could possible cause a species to count deadly poisons as a regular part of their diet?!” Martha demands.\n\n“Null in enormous quantities.”\n\n“Don’t you bring your reason and rational explanations into my concerns young man.” She says in a louder tone as she leans back into her seat and Holly breaks into giggles as Bjorn chuckles and leans back as well.\n\n“Fine, I’ll just pout, get angry and start shouting next time instead.” He says and Martha crosses her arms and offers him a stern look. He merely raises an eyebrow as he pours himself a glass of water. “Alright new topic, what did you two think of the movie? The Tale of Varg’Terra?”\n\n“Oh very typical Apuk fare I’m afraid. They’re in love with the idea of their warriors riding off to be gallant heroes and keep trying to portray the other side as some kind of wicked dark knights unworthy of the titles.”\n\n“No matter who’s looking backwards at history they’re almost always trying to make someone look bad. It’s just universal.” Bjorn notes as he thinks to his own ancestors. Love them or hate them, the Vikings certainly made an impact on the world.\n\n“Oh yes, look into things closely enough and I’m sure you’ll find a laundry list of justified provocations between both countries. If it wasn’t for the odd forests on Serbow that create sorcerers out of dissatisfied and angry men then it would just be another historical movie.”\n\n“I thought it was amazing.” Holly interrupts.\n\n“Oh? What did you like about it?” Martha asks as Bjorn takes a sip.\n\n“I mean... it was incredible wasn’t it? The way that it starts with him running from his burning village and into the forest and as things happen it kept going back to him growing stronger and stronger. By the time his home country was completely conquered he was part of the forest and it roared with him. To see him grow from something so small and scared to something unstoppable was just... I mean...” Holly clams up at that point and Martha leans into her to offer comfort.\n\nThankfully the food arrives shortly after and breaks up the awkwardness, leaving Bjorn staring at a purple steak and blinking rapidly to reassess what he thought he understood about meat. It smells... unlike anything he’s ever smelt before. It’s savoury and meaty, but there’s something else to it he just can’t identify.\n\n“First time hon?” The waitress asks and Bjorn nods. “Yea, that’s the problem when an omnivore is raised by herbivores. It’s always a leap.”\n\nThankfully she’s jumping to all sorts of incorrect, but understandable assumptions. Assumptions that have Holly giggling lightly to herself in amusement.\n\n“Indeed, nothing to do but give it a bite then.” Bjorn remarks as he cuts a generous piece of the steak and... it... What is this?\n\nHis face contorts in sheer confusion as he chews and tries to figure out the meat. It doesn’t taste bad. In fact it doesn’t taste like much beyond vaguely meat, the texture reminds him of steak but the taste is just... it’s not anything he’s ever had. It’s vaguely mammalian but it doesn’t have that gamey taste so it’s not wild. It most certainly is not beef. Nor is it lamb though. It doesn’t taste like pork or chicken or turkey or duck or goose, not any kind of fish... The closest he can place it to was the one time he’d eaten bugs on a dare. Past the crunch there had been a hint of something...\n\nA loud and abrasive snort draws Bjorn out of his thoughts to see Holly struggling to not choke on her waffles.\n\n“It’s his first time.” Martha confirms to the amused waitress.\n\n“Fair enough, it’s always quite the show for a first timer to make sense of a meal.”\n\n“Okay, I give up. What is a lanwrack?” Bjorn asks and Holly starts choking again but manages to quickly get it under control.\n\n“It’s a big lizard beast that eats grasses and leaves.” The Waitress says and Bjorn turns to her in surprise. “It’s got three big tails that help it get up trees, but it only uses two at once. So we chop one off and eat that meat. They also grow the tails back so it doesn’t even hurt the beast much. After a few months the new tail is fully grown in and you can harvest from the same creature again.”\n\n“Hunh, regenerating lizard meat. Not what I expected, but not bad. Not like anything I’ve ever had before, but not bad.” Bjorn notes and the waitress nods and walks off with a bit of a giggle. She mentions it being another one for the wall.\n\n“Feeling better?” Bjorn asks Holly who nods and he smiles before taking another bite of the very confusing meat he’s now mentally slotting into its own category.\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/nfsakq/out_of_cruel_space_part_1/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/qzw0lz/out_of_cruel_space_part_183/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/r1fapf/out_of_cruel_space_part_185/) ",

The most famous superstition is with regard to black cats. Black cats are regarded as highly unlucky. To some humans. To other humans, black cats are regarded as lucky. As with all superstitions, this is obviously nonsense. However, humans cling to this mass of conflicting theories with no basis in fact.*  \n>*The list of superstitions include (but are not limited to) opening weather mitigation devices indoors, walking under portable elevation devices, even numbered leaves on Oxalis tetraphylla, dropping grains of sodium chloride, and carrying the severed distal portion of a Leporidae. These may be regarded as \"bad luck\" or \"good luck\" by any individual human. (Though generally opening weather mitigation devices under portable elevation devices is universally considered as \"bad luck\" among humans.)*  \n>*It will be impossible to know in advance exactly what superstitions your humans will harbor. Just humor your humans' idiosyncrasies. If they are upset when a mirror breaks, don't explain that the mirror can be easily repaired or replaced, just apologize and get a new mirror.*  \n>Dybbuk Review of Ontological Species Studies. *The Care and Feeding of Humans*, \"Away with Red Shirts.\", published by Glass and Steele, [The Care and Feeding of Humans] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DybbukReview/), translation engine 3.14159\n\n\n---\n\n\nAfter dinner, Zoe stood up. \"I think we need to have a discussion about our plan for tomorrow. Querif and Allen are going to work on the communication system. We should probably work on collecting a few samples for the team tomorrow as well. Just in case we have to call the expedition and go back, we won't be empty handed. I want to also spend a little time observing the quagmire again. I'll take a couple of force field nodes with me, and just do some discreet observations, because that thing is bugging me. But tonight,\" she paused and smiled. \"Tonight, I think we should try some roasted marshmallows.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Allen shouted, raising a fist in the air. \"Finally!\"\n\nThey broke out the marshmallows, and Terif had long forks for roasting and a small fuel gel pack for 'fire'. Nate seemed to prefer to set his on fire and then wave it about to put the fire out before eating it. Zoe like to gently roast hers on all sides until it was an even brown color. Allen set his on fire like Nate, but then he pulled the burned marshmallow layer off and ate that, and roasted the interior remains of his marshmallow gently like Zoe did. He explained he got the best of both worlds. Terif and Querif tried all the methods, but Nerif just stuck to copying Zoe. She wasn't all that comfortable waving a flaming ball of sugar around in the air. \n\nThe roasted marshmallows tasted just as delicious as Allen had promised, and seemed to give an initial burst of energy that Nerif enjoyed. After a while, she and the 'rifs settled down and they all sat and sang songs. Nerif was very sleepy, and didn't notice when she drifted off.\n\nIn the morning, she woke up to Terif making breakfast. \"I slept through my watch?\" Nerif asked, horrified. \n\nTerif grinned a little lopsided. \"We all did. Well, not the humans. They kept watch. They said a lot of sugar can do that to some folks.\"\n\n\"Zoe, you should have woken me up,\" Nerif said, but looking around, didn't see Zoe. \"Where is Zoe?\"\n\nNate grabbed some breakfast from Terif and stuck a forkful in his mouth. \"She left earlier,\" he said around his food. \"Wanted to get an early start observing the quagmire.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Nerif felt a little let down. She knew Zoe wanted to just get in and out, and taking her along would have slowed Zoe down, but she felt like Zoe left before she woke up to avoid her. \n\n\"Ok, well, I guess we all have plenty to do anyway.\" She pulled on some fresh clothes, and scrubbed her face before pulling out the storm data again.\n\n\"Nerif, what the hell do you have on?\" Nate asked. Everyone else looked up at Nate's tone and Allen made a sound. Nerif looked down at her clothes. \"My clothes?\" she said.\n\n\"A red shirt. What in the hell were you thinking, putting on a red shirt on an expedition!\" Nate said. He sounded almost angry. Nate had never been angry at her before. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Nerif said. \"I'll change.\"\n\nNate sighed. \"I'm sorry Nerif, I shouldn't have jumped on you like that. It's just a silly superstition.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's okay,\" Nerif said. \"I'll change.\" When she was done changing, Nate looked embarrassed. \n\n\"Any luck with those storm charts?\" he asked. \n\nNerif shook her head. \"I've gone over them and over them, but I don't see any patterns.\"\n\n\"Let me try,\" Nate said. \"Humans are really good at finding patterns,\" he said.\n\nNerif handed over the data with a sigh of relief. \"Don't let Zoe hear you say that,\" she warned him with a smile. \n\nShe stood up and looked around. She could collect some samples. Nothing big and nothing too far away from the force field. She didn't want to have to drag Nate or Allen away from their jobs to bodyguard her. She took a walk around the perimeter of the ground station, still inside the force field, trying to pick out what kind of samples she would collect. \n\nFubsy followed her, until Nerif picked her up and took her in to Terif. \"Terif, you're on Fubsy duty again. I'm worried that she might try to run out of the force field when I go through to get a sample.\"\n\nTerif willingly took Fubsy into his arms. \"Fubsy girl, do you want a snack?\"\n\nNerif went back out and circled again. This time, she paused near where Nate's antelope had impacted the force field. There were a few glow worms on the ground. Evidently they'd fallen off when the whatever had dragged the antelope away. \n\n*Perfect!* Nerif thought, and went to get a few collection kits. She came back with the kit and crouched down on the ground, examining the best way to collect one. She opened the plastic case, the bottom in one hand and lid in the other, tried gently scooping up the glowworm. It popped like a soap bubble and Nerif rocked back on her heels, thinking. \n\nShe pulled out her knife and dug underneath the ground around the glowworm, and then picked up the soil sample, the glowworm balanced on top. She slid soil and worm into the collection box and labeled it with the date, time, and geomarker, as well as notes about the history they had observed. She picked up the remaining two glowworms the same way, and was able to successfully collect them without damaging them. \n\nShe headed back into the station and Fubsy came running up to her, making little beeps at her. Nerif picked her up with one hand, samples in the other. \n\n\"How's it going?\" she asked Nate, while she loaded the samples into the case. A simple job made a little more difficult by Fubsy's interference and head butting.\n\nNate groaned and rubbed his eyes. \"I've been looking at this data for hours, and I can't see any patterns.\"\n\n\"It hasn't been hours,\" Nerif said. \"Hardly even one hour. Zoe's probably just got to the site about now.\"\n\n\"Zoe's been there for hours,\" Nate said, surprised. \n\nNerif looked at him. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"She left early this morning,\" Nate said. At Nerif's lack of comprehension he clarified. \"*Early* this morning. When it was still dark. She took some force field nodes with her and-\" Nate looked at Nerif's expression. \"Hey, don't look like that! She's fine. She sent an update about 40 minutes ago.\"\n\nNerif set Fubsy down and held out her hand for the data. \"I'd feel better if you'd go check on her,\" Nerif said. \"Give me the data. We'll stay here with Allen. You go act as back up for Zoe.\"\n\nFubsy climbed up Nerif's leg making sad noises and Nerif picked her up again. \"You are a pest,\" she told Fubsy.\n\nNate stood up and stretched. \"Zoe told me to keep an eye on you. Here. She's a grown up and a veteran. She knows what she's doing.\"\n\nNerif thought back to Rril's file and opened her mouth to say something, as Zoe walked in through the door. \n\n\"Yes, I do know what I'm doing,\" Zoe agreed. \"And what I'm doing is calling an end to this expedition. Now. Allen and Querif, do you have the communication up and running yet?\"\n\nAllen shook his head. \"We've hit a little snag with the power supply. We can hook it up to the main battery, same as we do the lights, but in order to prevent burning out the circuits we've put in, we need a trickle energy source first. The ground station is burned out, so we can't get it up and running.\"\n\nZoe's face looked grim. \"We need that up and running. In fact, we need the station to landscape a landing area right near here and send another shuttle.\"\n\n\"What's going on, Zoe?\" Nerif asked. \n\n\"I spent all morning watching the quagmire,\" Zoe said. \"I think it uses spores for mind control. To bring prey to the main base. It's not one big creature, it's a million little ones.\"\n\nShe looked at the confused faces around her and sighed. \"Back home, we have these ants. And these spores. And these spores infect these ants and then make the ants leave the colony and climb up a tree to spread more spores. I saw this thing. It looked like a cross between a skunk and hedgehog. It started eating Nate's antelope-\"\n\n\"It's not my friggen antelope,\" Nate said under his breath, though everyone could hear him.\n\n\"It popped some of those glowworm things. And then after a while, it just stopped eating and walked into the middle of the quagmire and stopped. And didn't struggle when it got pulled down. And I think we should leave. Now. And not come back until we have better protection than is used for a two or three rated planet,\" Zoe said.\n\n\"But Zoe,\" Nerif said. \"I collected some glowworms today. One of them popped, and I feel perfectly fine.\" \n\nThen everything started growing dark, and she could hear Zoe's voice, full of pain. So much pain it made her want to cry for Zoe. And what Zoe said was, \"Oh, Nerif!\"\n\n---\n\n[First] [f] | [Previous] [p] | [Next] [n]  \n[Music] [m] suggested by /u/AugmentedLurker  \n[Additional Music] [a] suggested by /u/AugmentedLurker",

They’d still be monsters in your eyes even if they grew up on the softest of garden worlds. Their home simply hardened them, prepared them for us. \n\nNo, it’s not that they drink reactor coolant for fun. Or that their idea of a good meal requires literal bioweapons and fertilizer in order to make it ‘flavorful’. Capsaicin. Sodium chloride. They even need *potassium* in their diets! But as curious as that is, it's hardly something to fear as long as the more delicate of you avoid sampling their cuisine.\n\nNo, it's not that they *still* have yet to unite their homeworld’s many governments. Yes. *Many*. It's the first thing every space faring race does before they even leave their gravity well, and they couldn’t even do that normally! \n\nNo… Humans have something worse. Something that could easily destroy all that you know, if they so much as wished it.\n\nHuman beings will bond with anything.\n\nYes. *Anything*. Their crewmembers. Their superiors. Their sworn mortal enemies. I’ve seen it all. By the five hells, lock eyes with the right human and they’d probably die for you if it came to it!\n\nEven stranger, their bonding abilities do not apply strictly to other intelligent beings. The stories of a human bonding with their ship? With their non-intelligent pet? With the weapon they carried into battle? All true.\n\nStill don’t believe me? I once watched a human run into direct gunfire, just to save a mindless janitorial drone. Not because it was expensive, not because it was shaped in a mildly humanoid fashion. No… The human *named* it, and that was enough!\n\nThat is why, with overwhelming support of the Ket’rahnian Holy Empire and all associated races, I will have to reject the council’s proposal for war. Furthermore, we hereby announce a pending treaty of mutual defense with the Terran Confederation. A treaty that holds no exception for council races, including the Council Defense Force. As per council law, we also are not obligated to provide aid for a war of aggression we have voted against, therefore we will hereby begin the withdrawal of all Ket’rahnian forces and financial support from the CDF should you agree to commit to this pointless war... \n\nHuman beings will bond with anything, and as their closest neighbors we were certainly no exception. \n\nI yield the remainder of my time.\n\n“You know we didn’t ask you to go that far…” Ambassador Anderson sighed, her face illuminated by the holographic figure of yours truly. A figure I wasted little time in clearing away once the recording had stopped.\n\nI was never going to get used to watching myself speak...\n\n“You know you wouldn’t have lasted a week against the CDF fleet otherwise.” I countered once I had finished, knowing fully by now that she was just complaining to complain. It was another one of those ‘human things’ she kept talking about. \n\nHonestly, a human that wasn’t grumbling about something was somehow scarier!\n\n“And yet somehow we’ll fare better dying together?” She continued, rubbing the sides of her head with her fingers in an expression I actually did fear. “Even considering the size of your fleets-”\n\n“They’d never actually commit to war without us.” I nearly chuffed, brushing over her insult as best I could. “Especially not *against* us. Even if they could win, the victory would be too costly.”\n\n“A pyrrhic victory...?” Well, at least that distracted her from her anger. The fur on the back of my neck standing on end the instant her eyes locked on to me. “How… *Human* of you.”\n\n“We learned long ago to trust your insights when it comes to war.” \n\nReally it was the exact way they had ended the Silviar Skirmish, or what they called the First Contact War. The concept of area denial minefields and hit and run gorilla tactics on our supply lines bleeding our technologically superior fleets dry before they could ever reach their homeworld. And that said nothing of the war on the ground…\n\n“You know I can’t sign this treaty.” Anderson eventually sighed again, thankfully not commenting on the fact that I had averted my eyes first. “Even with the support of congress, half the federation is ready to riot over you going down with us.”\n\n“What about the other half?” \n\n“The second and seventh fleets are already moving to shore up your hyperlane chokepoints, and I’ve been permitted to offer you an honorary seat on the confederation war committee. You tell me what the other half is thinking!”\n\n“...That a huntress is twice as deadly with the pack at her side?”\n\n“That was rhetorical…” She groaned, rubbing at her temples for the upteenth time today. “I should have retired years ago…”\n\nWe both knew she was just being dramatic. She absolutely lived for her job. Goddess, she was probably the only reason it had taken this long for the council to finally come to vote on this war! Her ability to take an argument and make it into a diplomatic nightmare a little too intimidating…\n\n“Just sign the treaty.” I stated as firmly as I’d dare. “It means nothing to my kind but legality, of which the council will wish to argue. But even without its ratification we’d still come to your defense.”\n\n“But why!” Tossing aside all pretext of formality, Anderson barely gave me a chance to yelp before she was suddenly standing in front of me. Her tiny frame barely reaching the center of my chest, though that spared me little from the power of her glare. “There is no reason for your people to die for my kind!”\n\n“...I believe you were the one who said *Till death do us part*.”\n\n“Wha-” She recoiled, her face flushing with a color I’d grown to love. “That isn’t- We’re not talking about *us*!”\n\n“Yet there are millions of our kind committed to the exact same partnerships.” I purred, my lips pulling up into a grin they were never truly meant to emulate. “Our races have become so entwined, you may as well be Ket’rahnian for all intents and purposes. The only reason it is mutual defense and not full integration into the empire is because of your government’s staunch refusal to be integrated in the first place.”\n\n“You lost the war...” She sighed yet again, her anger evaporating in an instant. Though that just meant she was slightly more receptive to a hug I couldn’t stop my arms from initiating. “You know they’re already talking about this being a ploy *we* came up with. They’re calling us biased on the evening news...”\n\n“They’ve been arguing that ever since the wedding.” I didn’t have to hear her muffled laugh, I could feel it. Her face burying itself into the soft fur on my stomach just like it always eventually did. \n\n“Remember when we announced the trade agreement?”\n\n“Mm.” I nodded, even her muffled speech understandable by now. “The lawsuits were… Entertaining.”\n\n“That’s not what you said during!”\n\n“Yet I’m sure I’ll come to view this fiasco the same way.” Slipping my arms carefully around her, I didn’t give my wife a chance to complain before I had her up and off her feet. Bringing her to a much more acceptable eye level, which was a rarity I’d come to enjoy as of late. “Please sign the treaty, Sarah. I really don’t want to ask your president myself.”\n\n“...You’re still afraid of her?”\n\n“I’d rather face the combined might of the CDF!” I shuddered, earning yet another laugh from my love. “Your matriarch is… A fearsome huntress.”\n\n“You know we’re going back for Christmas, right?”\n\n“Why do you think I’m asking for mutual defense?”\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Next] [n]",

This is brilliant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...\n\nSorry... inspired. >.> Call it fan fic sequel...?\n\nFollow up:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt that moment, a call buzzes through to their holos.  On the screen is one of the only things more fearsome to the rest of the galaxy than the humans and their new pact pack mates-, Murf, one of the Ghosts, the only species ever to arise out of a class 13- a hell world, from an unknown part of the galaxy beyond the Long Dark, who had refused to join anything as more than impartial, unaligned, associate. He happens to be stroking the head of a very old cat. Ultimately predatory, extremely secretive, relatively small in known numbers, they were often as ghosts- none had learned their name before an official name was designated, so that is who they become. Ghosts- near paranormal, tech so advanced it was otherworldly, and masters of death.... and they liked it/some cultural in joke enough, all refused to accept another species-wide name from outsiders. The monsters of the galaxy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey accept the conference call, and are somewhat unsurprised, despite all the security in place to keep peepers and unwanted invaders of all kinds out,  to hear, \"Stop bickering like an old married couple. Stop wasting the time had before it all explodes. All wise beings fear a strong matriarch. Certainly when she is your wife's. Anderson, Anderson... Silly human.  Why draw it out? You will sign. You know your husband and his people have now painted targets with tracking beacons on their backs.  You will not leave them to die after you are wiped out trying to stand alone. Not even the stupidest of you are numerous enough to stop what Humanity will do if this war actually proceeds. Besides, you bloody Humans taught the galaxy what it truly is to form a pact, a packbond like no other. Some... listened. Some see wisdom. Others see expedience. Others see naivete. Yet others... see Pack. Absolutely insane, suicidally familial, and crazy cute...pack.\"\n\nThe couple watch from either side of the desk, eyes narrowed, heads cocked at uncannily similar angles. Murf doesn't contact anyone without great reason.  Nor does he ramble.  But cute? Humans? Cute? As a species? That was new.\n\nMurf continues with a feral grin at sight of their confused humor. \"Yes. Insanely cute. Cutely insane. So soft. No armor. No retractable claws. No tearing fangs other than your cute canines backed by a bite force that will shatter most substances unless your brain is allowed to fool your body into thinking it can't. No flight or speed or natural toxins, yet so DELICIOUSLY deadly and daring that you bonded with dozens of colonies of microbial life, become worlds for trillions even before bonding with good bois. Or each other. Or the rest of us. Yours is the only species that will step foot on our planet. Did you know a few of you now even live here by choice? Humans have been BORN here.  Most of you come for FUN. I still chuckle over the shock of seeing you on your honeymoon-\"\n\nAnderson grins, almost maniacally, \"First, baby!!!!! No way I was passing that up, even on a diplomatic mission. The first human to... The volcanic ranges give unprecedented thermals.... gliding so high... for hours....\"\n\n\"Yes. With the high not zero chances of undetectable eruptions that are near constant certainties. Like the 80 foot waves your kind come to -surf- with no gear but a wooden board, a set of goggles, and a pair of shorts- for sport. As I said- cute. The point is... both of you should stop worrying. Some in the council are stupid. They plot. They scheme. They will, unfortunately, act because they believe they have finally progressed enough in hidden black sites to match you... they may be right. But it is unfortunate for them.... that is my Law. The Ghosts shall join this Phoenix mutual defense pact. You Humans made monsters adore you as well, even if we do not mate and intertwine with your kind as his do...  Your family is mine. You Humans, and those you claim as pack, are now clan to the Ghosts, with full rights to be named in the Archive of Clans. We hunt by your sides.  To the fingertips and gums. So do we tell the council... or just obliterate them when they give us cause that can be shown to the galaxy?\"",

    "body": "When we entered into the wider world of galactic society, nobody thought it would so.... boring. The moment our 7 month manned mission reached Proxima Centauri a delegation from the Galactic Planetary Union (GPU) made contact. They took the shuttle into their cargo bay and returned them to Earth within a few minutes.\n\nThey mediated a more active role of the UN to serve as our planetary government and in exchange, they would help us upgrade all technology to the level of the GPU for free. It took us a whole 4 years for everyone to come together, and for planetary infrastructure and law to be updated and implemented.\n\nWe proceeded to interface with the Galactic economy. This is where I came in. I was one of the first humans to get a job offworld. Human Trade Relations Consultant for the P'ar Trade Corporation. My job was to track the Earth stock exchange for pricing in commodities and exchange rates from earth currencies to Galactic Credits.\n\nLike I said, boring.\n\n---\n\nAfter a few weeks of settling in, my supervisor, Garbardar, told me  it was customary for new employees to use their signing bonus (which I think was generous. maybe? It's really hard to tell) to throw a party representative of their native culture to introduce themselves to people in the company. Now, I'm a bit of a foodie, so the idea of a nice dinner party seemed like fun. I was the only human, and this put me in a unique position to introduce them to whatever aspect of human cuisine I wanted. I ordered a bunch of fresh produce from earth, a few dozen bottles of nice booze to pair with each course and a couple wheels of the most interesting cheeses.\n\nEver since I moved here, I couldn't find my local grocery store and ended up buying all of my food from some sort of nutritional supplement store where all they sold were ration bricks and a hundred varieties of soylent powder to meet the nutritional needs of various species.\n\nI made sure that the food I was getting was not toxic to anyone else, so no caffeine, chocolate or capsaicin, since several species are deathly allergic to those substances. Luckily, that didn't limit me very much. It was going to be an amazing dinner.\n\nIt was going to go like this. \n\nCourse one, a tabla with assorted cheeses and cured meats, including a whole Pata Negra (and I'll just keep whatever is left after the party for myself :D).\n\nCourse two, a nice, simple chicken consomme.\n\nCourse three, I ordered two live salmon in stasis so I could make super fresh sashimi. Luckily soy sauce and wasabi aren't toxic to any of my coworkers species.\n\nCourse four, I ordered two dry aged tomahawk steaks and grilled them on mesquite wood. I had to buy and use a special air filter to be able to cook it with actual fire, but it was needed for that flame grilled flavor.\n\nCourse five, a nice palate cleansing salad made from watercress, watermelon, feta, pomegranate seeds and crushed mint.\n\nCourse six, I got an assortment of fresh & dried fruits alongside an assortment of dessert cheeses.\n\nEvery course had it's own wine, and I got enough for everyone to have up to several glasses.\n\nI was able to program some robots to act like servers and even dressed them up in tuxedos for the service. This is going to be great.\n\n---\n\nThe doorbell rung, I still can't get over that weird monotone chiming, it sounds like a low fire alarm, but it works (I guess). I answered the door and all 20 of the people from my department were standing outside my front door. I welcomed them as best I could, though it was difficult with all 20 of them rapidly marching through my front door.\n\nThey stood in my living room and looked at me expectantly.\n\n\nAfter a second or so of silence I said, \"So, uh, welcome everyone. Heh, I didn't really expect you all to show up all at once.\"\n\nGarbardar looked around and said, \"The gathering was scheduled for 2300 hours, it is 2300 hours.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah.\" I said, \"I guess I'm more used to earth, where people show up *around* the mentioned time. You know, in case it takes a little longer to find the venue, or whatever.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said, \"Well, we're all here. Let me introduce you to everyone in the department.\"\n\nHe proceeded to tell me the names and species of each of my coworkers, one by one. It was all rather clinical and took about 10 minutes.\n\nImmediately after I nodded in greeting to the last person, Garbardar said, \"Now take a moment to explain the traditional gathering of your people.\"\n\nI was a little taken aback. The proceedings were rather mechanical and more efficient that I was used to, so I kind of floundered for a few seconds.\n\n\"Uh, normally, uh, on my homeworld that is we, uh, celebrate in a number of different ways. But my favorite, I suppose, is the dinner party, where the host creates a menu to showcase their cooking talents and introduce their friends or colleagues to new and interesting cuisines\"\n\nThere was a bit of mumbling, after which Garbardar said, \"Excuse me, the translator seems to be malfunctioning. What was that last word again?\"\n\n'Uh, you mean cuisines?\" I asked. I wasn't sure if he was joking, but in the three weeks I had known him, his sense of humor was very different from ours. The *ol' switcheroo* wasn't a part of it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that word. Can you describe the meaning of that word in other terms?\" Several others nodded in agreement.\n\nAt this point I was pretty confused. \"I, uh, ok. Um. Cuisines is the plural, uh, of cuisine?\" They nodded, and Garbardar made a circular gesture with several of his hands.\n\n\"Um. Haha, I've never had to describe this before, just a second.\" I scratched my head and thought for a second, \"Cuisine, I guess, is a, uh. Wait a sec.\" At this point I pulled out my phone and googled it (one of the first ways we became a part of the galaxy was to connect the earth internet with the galactic one).\n\n\"Cuisine. A style or method of cooking, especially as characteristic of a particular country, region or establishment.\" I looked up, and they were looking at each other, nonplussed.\n\nZim Zar Bai, one coworker, gestured to draw attention to himself and said, \"Not to be rude, but why do you have a word for that?\" Several others nodded in agreement and looked at me expectantly.\n\nI was totally confused and phone was vibrating, indicating that I should begin serving the first course. \"You know what, I'll show you why and explain along the way.\"\n\nI opened the robot control app and started the first service. Several robots came out with chilled wine glasses and unopened bottles of wine, and others had wooden platters covered in Jamon, Charcuterie and several types of cheese. As the servers spread out, I gestured for my coworkers to spread out.\n\n\"First, take the glass and hold it by the stem. This is to minimize how much of your body heat is transferred into the beverage, known as wine. This wine is a white wine from the Rioja region of Spain. On the wooden slabs are various cured meats and cheeses. This wine in particularly well suited to this course, and you'll find the flavors complimentary.\"\n\nWhile doing this, the robots spread out, offering slabs and glasses, and pouring wine. They sniffed tentatively at the food and drink before indulging.\n\nThis time Gourusekinomanonsk, Gouru for short, drew attention to himself, \"There is another one. What was that penultimate word?\"\n\nI was finally starting to notice a pattern, \"uh, flavors?\" He nodded in affirmation while using his mandibular pincers to pick apart a slice of Jamon. \"um. My species has specialized nerve endings in our mouths that allow us to detect the chemical composition of what we're eating. It's similar to smelling.\"\n\n\"Ah\", he said. He immediately pulled the now eviscerated ball of ham lint from his mouth and began kneading it with his smaller, upper hands. \"Oooh\" he said, nodding in appreciation, \"interesting.\"\n\n\"Uh, ok.\" I said as he placed the ball of ham lint back on a tray and picked up a slice of cheese and mashed it in between his smaller hands.  Several others started to take his cue and began interacting with the food in strange ways. Some simply smelled it deeply, others chewed it very thoroughly. I have to say, it was weird.\n\n\"Uh, try combining several different foods, and sipping the wine before or after to mix the, uh, flavors.\" Gouru dipped his proboscis in his glass of wine and slowly drained it while mashing pieces of cheese and meat into a ball in his smaller hands. Others dropped the meat into their glass of wine and sniffed it. About half of them actually ate and drank somewhat normally.\n\n\"I think this fluid spoiled in transit\" Said Teemin between sips of the wine.\n\n\"Oh, no, it's fermented grape juice.\" Another wave of nods and gestures. \"The chemical is ethyl alcohol.\"\n\n\"You drink ethyl alcohol on purpose? Does that not impair your motor functions?\" Garbardar said through a mouthful of Jamon and several cheeses.\n\n\"Well, it has that effect, but the concentration of alcohol in this beverage is so low that it only creates a very mild, pleasant form of that effect. It's often described as a 'social lubricant', since it makes people more willing to socialize and get to know each other.\" I was actually starting to enjoy myself, and so was everyone else. They were all discussing how odd and fascinating they found our nourishment and socialization protocols.\n\nThe food ran out rather quickly, and people were left sipping wine and discussing the strange food and drink. Luckily I had plenty. After about 10 minutes of joking and chatting my phone buzzed again.\n\n\"Let's all move into the dining room for the second course.\"\n\nSeveral people said \"what?\" at the same time.\n\n\"Haha, in my culture it is customary, especially during dinner parties, to showcase *multiple* cuisines, not just one.\" I explained, but people still seemed confused. \"Oh, and we usually dedicate a room to eating for sitting and eating.\" Confusion dispelled.\n\nWe filed into the dining room, and everyone took a seat. The table was already set, and the bowls of chicken consomme were covered with nice little lids to keep them warm.\n\n\"Just remove the lid and use the utensil to the side to eat the liquid.\" I instructed, miming drinking soup at the same time.\n\nEveryone was now revealing the clear, yellow liquid with amazement as plumes of steam came out. There was a chorus of sounds of interest and amazement as people examined everything from the lid, the spoon and the soup, and sniffed the sherry and the new glass it was served in. The wine from before seemed to strip away that extremely formal air from when they first arrived. People were chatting and joking, laughing and talking about the wacky liquids. Everyone laughed when Gouru tried to use his proboscis to drink the tiny amount of soup from the spoon. His proboscis kept unrolling in and out of his neck, only to slurp up the soup in about a tenth of a second.\n\n\"You can drink directly from the bowl if that's easier, it's not rude\" I said, stifling laughter. Several others picked up the bowls with their hands or extended drinking apparatuses into the bowls to drink the soup.\n\n\"This is so very different from the previous... course\" Said Garbardar, who had already finished his soup. He would sip his sherry and grimace, frowning at it, but then continued to drink. Two courses in and the whole experience was hilarious.\n\n\"Yes, this is consomme, a clear soup made from the clarified body fat of a chicken, and lightly spiced with Sodium Chloride and other plants to refine the flavor. You use the protein jelly found in chicken eggs to absorb and remove fat solids to further clarify the liquid. Sherry is similar to wine, though it is fermented for longer and tends to have a higher alcohol content, which is why there is much less of it.\"\n\nEveryone watched intently and consumed the food, now fully immersed in this wholly alien experience. This was possibly the greatest dinner party I have ever thrown.\n\nEveryone finished their consomme right as the next silent alarm went off. The robots came in, took away the settings for the consomme and brought in the chilled dishes of Sashimi.\n\nEveryone was less interested in the flavor of this but instead with the texture and the fact that it is raw. \"This is so viscerally satisfying\" said Skwantsee, \"it feels so good on my teeth.\"\n\nOthers nodded. \"What is this black liquid?\" said Gouru right before dipping his proboscis into it. He immediately shuddered. \"That is very... powerfully flavored.\"\n\n\"Haha, that's a dipping sauce. You dab the edge of the slice of fish into it to add to the flavor. It's a fermented bean product that has a tremendous amount of sodium in it, so use it sparingly.\" I smiled and so did Gouru. Sort of.\n\nThis course, people were also highly fond of the Koshu served with it, and I actually opened the last bottle before the last of sashimi was finished. Meanwhile, between mouthfuls of just wasabi and sips of Koshu, Garbardar said \"how many more courses are there?\"\n\nI was highly encouraged by his tone, which suggested that he hoped there were more, not less.\n\n\"There are three more,\" I said, at which point others bristled excitedly.\n\n\"Do humans eat like this every day?\" Asked Xif, \"or is this only for special occasions?\"\n\n\"Oh, this is mostly for special occasions.\" I said as the robots cleared the table and reset it for the next course, \"mostly we only eat one or two courses per meal, sometimes three. Our species enjoys variety, especially in our food.\"\n\nAt this point, the two tomahawk steaks were placed in front of me on a cutting board, and I was handed carving tools. I proceeded to carve the steaks and serve portions to plates held out by the robots, and before serving them the robots added buttered asparagus on the side.\n\n\"This is the meat of the cow, rubbed in salt and hung in a dry room to cure it slightly. Afterwards, I grilled it over a flame made from the wood of the Mesquite tree, which lends a special flavor to the meat.\"\n\nEveryone took their plates and dug in immediately.\n\n\"Didn't you have to get a permit to use fire?\" Garbardar asked.\n\n\"I did, and I had to use a special air filtration machine to keep the fumes from getting into the atmosphere.\" I replied.\n\nThe red wine I paired with this received less attention than the steak, which was absolutely delicious. People were far too busy eating to even talk, and I actually had to carve several extra portions. People were eating all the way up to the next silent alarm, and the bones of the tomahawk chops were actually stripped almost clean.\n\nAs the robots came around to change the place setting, people were dabbing their faces and such with napkins.\n\n\"Will the wonders never cease?\" asked Teemin, and others chuckled. \"What else do you have in store for us?\"\n\nAs she finished her sentence, the robots began placing the salads, which looked absolutely gorgeous. Compared to the last few courses, which were somewhat monochromatic, the mixture of red, green and white was visually stunning.\n\n\"This is a salad made from the flesh of a watermelon, pomegranate seeds, feta cheese, watercress leaves and crushed mint leaves.\" I said, mixing my salad, \"It's intended to cleanse your palate of the heavier courses and leave you refreshed.\"\n\nI did not need to encourage anyone to try it. Everyone dug into the food, mixing and tasting individual components, mixing and matching. They were too engrossed to talk, and I fear befuddled from being so full and more than a little drunk. As they continued to eat, however, the conversation picked back up.\n\nI served this one with glasses of chilled Freixenet Cava, and people were delighted by the bubbles and sweet flavor. The crunchy, sweet summer salad went perfectly with the bitter-sweet, dry Cava, and people were starting to pick up on it. They were now spending more time conversing with each other about the meal than asking me questions.\n\nWhen the final course was served, everyone was chatty again, thanks to the infusion of alcohol and the freshness of the salad. We returned to the living room to stand and chat while drinking and snacking on the fruit and cheese. I have always loved Cava, so I went overboard and had enough Cava to last us through the night.\n\n---\n\nAll in all it was a great success. I introduced my coworkers to my culture, to my favorite cuisines and to new experiences as a whole. Over the course of the evening, I found out that the place I thought was a health food shop was, in fact, just a regular grocery, and that most cultures didn’t have such widely varied foods and drinks. Other species were much more pragmatic about their food, but now that I have introduced them to the idea, others have begun experimenting with preparations of fresh produce from their own home worlds.\n\n---\n\nSorry if this is too long, but I hope you enjoy.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Chloride, not Iodide.\n\nEDIT 2: Woah, thanks kind human for the Gold! My first gilding ever! :D",

    "body": "The Human home world of Earth is a fascinating place.\n\nBy Galactic standards, it is amongst the harshest places to ever produce sentient life, let alone an intelligent and star faring civilization. Describing the planet as \"extreme\" doesn't quite do it justice. \n\nThe Humans are not really specialized in any field of study or work, but they can turn their hands to anything with the right training. They are nothing, if not adaptable.\n\nThey are, in a word, tough. Various levels, and different kinds of tough, but tough nonetheless. \n\nAs a Botanist, however, I'm more interested in telling you of a particular plant that grows on Earth. As, no doubt, you've already read or heard hundreds for stories about all manner of Human behavior.\n\nWith thousands of varieties native to a single mountain range, and their ability to grow almost anywhere on the Earth, they are incredible. \n\nHumans call it a potato. Or a \"humble potato\", if you want to be a bit poetic about it. For something that grows on a deathworld, it is completely benign, even to non-Human stomachs. Wash, peel, boil and mash. Even the most delicate of digestive constitutions can handle plain mashed potatoes. Though, the Humans like to mix Sodium Chloride and processed animal fats to it just to make it edible by their standards. Even for them, plain ones are too bland.\n\nWith that blandness, comes nearly infinite variety in ways to prepare them. From the aforementioned mashed, to fried slices in various sizes, baking them whole and covering them with all manner of toppings, baking bread, making candy, and even more. You are only limited by your imagination. \n\nAnd, as is typical of Humans, they even learned how to make some of their strongest intoxicating beverages from this tuber. \n\nAs I learned about this plant, I started to see similarities between Humans and potatoes.\n\nHumans have so many different cultures, skin colors, and religious beliefs, but all of them are Human beliefs.  Potatoes have thousands of different types, all under the heading of \"potato\". \n\nTheir \"jack of all trades\" mentality means they can learn just about anything. Like a potato, they are rather plain, and can be made to be anything that you can imagine. \n\nThe potato is a jack of all trades as well, I'm told that a Human can survive on nothing but potatoes with their skins and the processed animal fats mentioned above for weeks on end as long as they have properly clean water as well. \n\nHumans spread across their planet, and are starting to spread through the galaxy. They grow where they are planted, provided they have enough basic resources. Like a potato (which, they grow on 90% of their colonies, so the comparison works for both) and they still grow them all over their home world. \n\nHowever, it may surprise you to know that the potato is a member of a family of plants that is poisonous. For all I've said about it's bland nature and uses, the green parts are toxic. Several types of potato are actually more toxic than others, and can even lay a Human low.\n\nSo, like the potato, certain Humans are more deadly than others. Most are completely unobtrusive and calm, but you still need to tread carefully.  You need to know the exact \"variety\" of Human you are dealing with before you deal with them, otherwise an upset stomach may be the least of your worries. And, as you know, there are few things that even an average Human *can't* lay low. \n\nExcerpt from \"Plant life of the Deathworlds: Earth Edition\" by Professor Urno Thannar.",

Fish and Sodium Chloride, commonly known as salt. If you ever hire a Limniad chef, make sure he or she understands your salt intake preference. Ruana, for obvious reasons, are best advised not to retain a Limniad chef for any reason. The newest species to join the Aggregate is the Terran species known as Humans. They have a drink known as \"soy sauce\" which is highly sought after by Limniads for special events. \n\n\n>Dybbuk Review of Ontological Species Studies. *All About Limniads*, \"Salt of the Sea.\", published by Glass and Steele, [All About Limniads] (https://www.reddit.com/r/DybbukReview/), translation engine 3.1415\n\n---\n\n\nZoe darted through the door before it had opened all the way. \"Fubsy! Fubsy!\"\n\nNerif was right behind and saw Fubsy emerge from behind one of the lounges in the main room. Her fur stuck out straight from her body, making her look bigger, and her tail was whipping back and forth very quickly. Nerif didn't know anything about Terran cats, but Fubsy didn't look happy.\n\nWhen Fubsy saw that it was them, she seemed to calm down. Her fur started settling down and her tail slowed down. She ran over to Zoe and made little chirping noises and dropped what she'd been carrying in her mouth. It was a torn piece of white fabric.\n\nZoe looked up at Nerif. \"Call the captain, now.\"\n\nNerif nodded and tapped her bracelet. \"Liaison Nerif calling for captain. Priority Urgent.\"\n\nThe captain's voice emerged from the bracelet. \"Liaison Nerif? Is there an issue?\"\n\n\"Oh, you bet there's an issue,\" Nerif said harshly. \"Get down here. Now.\"\n\nZoe looked at Nerif in surprise. *Everyone* looked at Nerif in surprise. \n\n\"Wow, Nerif,\" Allen said. \"I didn't know you had it in you.\"\n\n\"Someone did something to Fubsy,\" Nerif said, her fury barely controlled.\n\n\"True enough,\" Allen said, and no one said anything more.\n\nIn just a few minutes, the door rang and announced the captain. Nerif stalked to the door and opened it up. \n\n\"Someone was in our quarters without our permission,\" Nerif said. \"And someone distressed our cat. We take that very seriously. It's grounds for termination of the contract. You should take it seriously, too.\"\n\nCaptain Rackham sat down on one of the lounges, which creaked a little under his weight. \"Most assuredly, lady, I do. What happened?\"\n\n\"After our breakfast, we went on a tour of the ship. When we came back,\" Nerif paused and Zoe took over.\n\n\"When we came back, one of *your* crew members said he'd been looking for us. But if he'd been looking for us, he'd have used the sprite from the bracelet to find us, instead of coming to our quarters, wouldn't he?\" Zoe said, a bite sharp in her voice.\n\n\"He was leaving our quarters. I could tell he'd been in here. When we came in Fubsy had this,\" Zoe tossed the scrap of white material on the captain's lap.\n\n\"I suggest,\" Nerif said, picking up the narrative, \"That unless you want this contract terminated, with penalties, you will find that crew member. Now.\" She yelled the last word and even the captain jumped at the volume.\n\nThe captain tapped his bracelet. \"Give me the names of all crew in the vicinity of these quarters for the last half hour.\"\n\n\"In the past half hour, the crew members near quarters MB134 are: Captain John Rackham,\" an electronic voice announced.\n\nThe captain looked surprised. \"Expand search. All crew members near these quarters for the past hour.\"\n\n\"In the past hour, the crew members near quarters MB134 are: Captain John Rackham.\"\n\n\"Expand search. Anyone leaving level M corridor B for the past four hours, subtract the residents of MB134 and Captain Rackham from the results,\" Captain Rackham said. \n\n\"Searching…no results found.\" \n\nCaptain Rackham sat up straighter and turned to Nerif. \"I suggest we head back to my quarters, where my tools and resources are greater.\"\n\n\"We're not leaving Fubsy behind,\" Querif said.\n\n\"Of course not, the dear lady must come with us as well,\" the captain said. \n\nAllen took Fubsy's leash and clipped it to her harness. When they stepped outside their quarters, the captain was in the lead and the team was unconsciously forming a protective circle around Fubsy. Once in the captain's quarters, he headed over to his desk. \n\n\"Show locations of everyone on Nonesuch level M corridor B at 8 bells this morning.\"\n\nDots appeared on the screen. \"Fast forward location tracking.\" \n\nDots moved on the screen, the time appearing in the lower right of the screen. At 8:40 ship time, the dots for the team appeared on level MB. \n\n\"That's when we came back from breakfast,\" Terif said.\n\n\"And there we are, dropping Fubsy off,\" Nate said, \"then we head out on our tour.\"\n\nThey watched the hallway, but no other dots appeared. The dots for the team reappeared at 9 bells, stopped outside their quarters briefly, and then went into MB134.\n\n\"Whoever it was that we met, didn't have their bracelet on,\" Nate said, tapping the screen. \n\n\"Can we see if anyone pinged our location during this time period?\" Querif asked.\n\n\"I see where you're going with this,\" Allen said. \"If someone was trying to find out where we were, and then took their bracelet off, it would give us their identity.\"\n\n\"No pings requested during this time frame,\" the electronic voice stated. \n\n\"Can you separate out all the Tralls?\" Querif asked. \n\nThere were two Tralls on level M, but both of them were moving while the break in was occurring. This meant the bracelet hadn't been removed and tucked away some place.\n\n\"Can you search for any bracelets not being worn?\" Zoe asked.\n\nThe captain sighed. \"I can, but regulations only require that they are worn during working hours. During non-working hours, it is a person's choice. At that time of day, 45% of the crew would be off duty.\"\n\n\"In any case, we already know that whoever broke in to your quarters had a detailed plan in place. It required them being off duty and you being away from your quarters. We don't know if Fubsy was a surprise for them, or the target.\" Captain Rackham picked up the piece of cloth and examined it. \"I can't be sure, but it does look like this comes from one of our uniforms.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there's any chance we can track the uniform?\" Nerif asked.\n\nCaptain Rackham shook his head. \"They're disposables. You wear them for the day, and recycle them and create new for the next day.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Nate said, a slight drawl in his voice, \"I reckon we know one more thing about our mysterious crew mate.\" \n\n\"What's that?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"You have a mole on board your ship,\" Nate said. And then he smiled.  \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n[First] [f] | [Previous] [p] | [Next] [n]  \n[Music] [m]  \n\n",

As we discussed the last time we spoke your food stuff intake must change or you will have serious health complications, your vascular system is already showing signs of distress.  Have you been following the consumption plan I have given you?”\n\n“Sure doc, I eat most of what's on the list you gave me. I eat vegetables, meat ,starch, and dairy with most of my meals just like you put on the list. Some of the stuff I don’t like sooo..., but for the most part I eat what you put on there.”\n\n“So you are following the dietary plan I have given you? Odd, I must review your scans again, perhaps there is another cause for your symptoms. I will have to ask you for another scan in a weeks time to make sure that there are no serious health concerns I must address. The captain would be very angry if the first human we have had on board becomes ill, it could case an incident within the conclave.”\n\n“Naww doc, I feel fine, I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about.”\n\n“Mr. Mac, for my peace of mind, please indulge me and return in one weeks time for another scan.”\n\n“If it will make you feel better, sure doc.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n“Food handler Sen’ra’te ,may I speak with you for a moment?”\n\n“Of course Healer Tak’ra’te, how may I be of service?”\n\n“Have you been given the dietary plan for the Human Mac Lamore? I’m seeing worrying changes in his health and am curious as to what I may be doing wrong with his dietary requirements. Have you been preparing his food stuffs according to the customs of his people?”\n\n“Healer, I have been trying to make a variety of the humans foodstuffs according to his peoples preparation methods but Mr. Lamore will almost exclusively only eat one kind of meal, it does contain many of the ingredients on the list provided. I have tried to prepare other meals for him, but he has so far declined to consume them.”\n\n“Can you show me this meal and how you prepare it?”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n“So this is the meal he consumes most days?”\n\n“That is correct, a patty made of … uhm, dead flesh, seared to what he calls rare, and melt a piece of curdled milk on top, put it between two pieces of ground and cooked wheat, you add sliced vegetable matter, and what are called condiments of sweetened vegetable mater and the emulsified ovum of an unfertilised egg with a vegetable oil. Then you boil the starch in a fat and add sodium chloride. It seems to be the dish of royalty. Something called the a cheeseburger and fries from a place called the king of Burgers”\n\n“And this is the only thing he is willing to consume?”\n\n“That is correct, I have tried to vary the items in the patty but every time I tell him I do se he proclaims that it it no longer palatable”\n\n“If you could, I will send you a list of things to add or replace his “patty” with as well as a replacement for the fat you boil his starch in. But please, do not tell him you're doing so.”\n\n“As you wish Healer”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n“Mr Mac, it seems my concerns were for naught, your scans are improving, perhaps it was just the stress of a new environment. Please continue to follow your dietary plan as prescribed, and I will see you in a months time for your usual scan.”\n\n“I told ya there was nothing to worry about doc, I’ll go grab some chow and I’ll make sure I follow the plan.”\n\n“And all the food is to your liking”\n\n“Yeah doc, almost like being home.”",

    "body": "Student nurse in an ICU, I've been *very* careful to avoid making any kind of med error, even for things as simple as a bag of NS, I make sure to show the nurse I'm working under that the bag clearly says 0.9% sodium chloride and of course I always scan everything before administration to keep the margin for error as slim as possible.\n\nI've been working on this unit for months and it wasn't until last night that I found out that unless I remove the fluids under the patient's name in the pyxis they aren't charged for it. Our fluids are on a shelf in our med room but arent locked in any container so I've just been grabbing the fluids straight off the shelf without bothering with the pyxis at all 💀. \n\nThing is I'm pretty sure when I had just started I asked someone about this specifically and they told me I didn't need to remove the fluids through the pyxis but it's possible I misheard. Same with insulin, it's in a fridge in our med room but the fridge isn't locked/accessed via the pyxis. I think I've \"pulled\" insulin through the pyxis like once when I was getting other meds for that same patient but ngl I usually just grab it straight from the fridge. I show the nurse I'm working under what type of insulin I'm drawing up before I draw it up, show them the amount of insulin in the syringe, and also scan the bottle before administration so I'm not worried about having made any kind of med error but if things being removed under the patient's name in the pyxis is truly the only way they get billed for it I guess I've been giving away free fluids and insulin which I can't say I particularly feel bad about.\n\n**Edit**: The person that told me this is one of our charge nurses which is why I assumed it to be accurate but honestly I'm not sure because I'm pretty sure I asked one of our other charge nurses about it when I first started and they said I didn't have to bother with the pyxis for fluids. I'll ask pharmacy about it next time I work but I'm not losing sleep over having potentially saved people some money. The charge nurse that told me this said they themselves had been doing it with insulin for the longest because they didn't know either. ",

You couldn’t even “pull” them from the Pyxis, we would get a message saying use floor stock. Same with insulin, one vial for the whole unit so we used barcodes created by pharmacy for scanning. Everywhere I have worked as well has used Pyxis, and never heard this. Pyxis itself is just a cabinet that interfaces with the EHR/EMR. Charging is a functionality of your EHR.

Might they send a patient a bill with each medication they charge on it in hopes that the patient will pay like that?  Sure!  But insurance companies pay based off diagnosis codes in the DRG system.  This means based off what the hospital codes for the patient, they get a pre-determined amount of money for it and all the costs come out of that leading to profit.  \nMore often than not, individual units have “budgets” within the hospital that are somewhat arbitrary and more or less designed to keep costs down and thus increase profits.  Individual department administrators are often given bonuses for getting their areas to spend less, which is why you have a lot of managers and people like supply chain telling you to use less things like saline flushes and bathing cloths.  Yay capitalism.\n\nThere are of course exceptions to the rule but my point is screw the system and charging patients for necessary meds.  It does not affect insurance reimbursement.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

Even though I haven't gone to the dermatologist, I don't think I have rosacea but just really dehydrated skin + sensitivity. I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.  I have just read a blog entry about TO Mandelic vs Stratia Mandelic and found it very informative.

Couple questions though: \n\n1) The PH is usually around 3. Most cleansers leave you around a 5 or so. Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "Welcome to the Crystal Growing subreddit! We’re a passionate community consisting of both hobbyists and professionals interested in growing crystals. Although it sounds difficult, growing crystals is actually very easy, and you can even do it at home.\n\nThis article is written specifically to help those who are just getting started with this hobby. If you’re a newbie, welcome aboard. And if you’re a seasoned veteran, do share your findings with us.\n\n[Some beautiful specimens from the community. Credits: 1. u\\/ob103ninja; 2. u\\/dmishin; 3. u\\/crystalchase21; 4. u\\/theBASTman; 5. u\\/ketotime4me](https://preview.redd.it/nyg8cfjij7551.jpg?width=1849&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14fb149eb225442b0e8976b06b52aa77a9fb28f)\n\nEven though growing crystals is simple, it will be extremely useful if you have some basic chemistry knowledge. This will help you understand the process that is taking place, and allow you to troubleshoot if you run into any problems. More experienced chemists will be able to synthesize their own compounds, the crystals of which can be quite unique. However, this guide is written for newcomers, so I will try to keep it as simple as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nLike any other activity, crystal growing might be completely safe or very dangerous. It depends on the chemicals you are working with, your safety measures, your procedure etc.\n\nThis guide only covers compounds that are safe to mildly toxic. Even so, you are responsible for your own safety. Don't use the family microwave/freezer in your experiments. Make sure you know the potential risk of the chemical you are using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nIf you want to start growing crystals immediately, skip to the next section. I highly recommend that you read this though, because understanding the process will help a ton.\n\nA crystal is a solid that has particles arranged in an orderly manner. This includes rocks, snowflakes and diamonds. However, the activity of growing crystals at home mainly focuses on a specific type of chemical known as salts.\n\nIn chemistry, a salt is a chemical compound made up of positive ions and negative ions. Table salt is one example. Its chemical name is sodium chloride, because it consists of a sodium ion and a chloride ion. There are many other salts as well, such as copper sulfate, ammonium phosphate and potassium nitrate. From now, I will use the term “salt” to refer to all such compounds, not just table salt.\n\nWe like to use salts to grow crystals because most salts are soluble in water. Why is this important?\n\nWhen they are dry, most salts look like powder. But if you zoom in, each grain of salt is actually a small crystal. The particles in every grain of salt are arranged neatly. The exact way they are arranged is different for each salt. For table salt, those particles are packed into cubes, so you can say that the grains of salt in your teaspoon are actually millions of tiny cubes. Meanwhile, alum salt crystals look like diamonds.\n\n[Image credits, left to right: Walkerma, Prosthetic Head, włodi](https://preview.redd.it/52c9sjyjj7551.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06200be9738fad76962f1216c6fa0bb1000484f5)\n\nBut we have a problem. We want to grow big, shiny crystals, not tiny, powdery crystals. This is the reason we dissolve the salt powder in water. After doing so, the glass of salty water we have is called a solution.\n\nIf you dissolve just a little salt in water, you get a dilute/undersaturated solution. Dissolve a lot, and you get a concentrated solution. Here’s the thing: a fixed volume of water can only dissolve a fixed mass of salt. For instance, the maximum amount of table salt you can dissolve in 100 ml of water is 36g. If you add 37g, the extra 1g will not dissolve. **A solution that contains the maximum amount of dissolved salt is called a saturated solution.**\n\nWe now have a glass of salt solution with the salt particles swimming inside. If we want a nice, transparent crystal to grow, we need to somehow make those particles “re-solidify”, and instead of popping out all over the place, they need to stick together and form a single, big crystal. There are two easy ways to make this happen. Master them, and you will be able to grow amazing crystals.\n\n· Slow cooling\n\n· Evaporation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methods**\n\nMethod I: Slow cooling\n\nLet’s start with slow cooling. With this method, we take advantage of the fact that hot water can dissolve more salt than cold water. For instance, 100 ml of 25°C water can dissolve 22g of copper sulfate, but the same amount of water at 80°C can dissolve 56 grams.\n\nTo carry out this method, we first heat our water up. Then, we dissolve **more salt than is actually soluble at room temperature**. Because the water is hot, the extra salt will dissolve, and you end up with a **supersaturated solution**. As the solution cools down, the solubility of the salt decreases, so the extra salt that you added just now has to “come out”. As a result, tiny crystals of salt start to form, and they grow bigger and bigger as more salt particles re-solidify and clump together. This process is called crystallization.\n\n[The process of crystallization. Time lapse of supersaturated solutions over 3 days by u\\/adam2squared](https://i.redd.it/b8lqywbck7551.gif)\n\nIf you do it correctly, you will end up with a large crystal of salt.\n\nMethod II: Evaporation\n\nJust now, I mentioned that 100 ml of 25°C water can dissolve 22g of copper sulfate. It also goes that 50 ml of water will be able to dissolve half that amount, 11g.\n\nThis time, we do not change the temperature. Instead, we change the volume of water. First, we dissolve our 22g of copper sulfate into 100 ml of water. Then, we let the solution slowly evaporate. As the volume decreases to 90 ml, 80 ml and so on, the extra salt has to crystallize out, causing copper sulfate crystals to form.\n\nThe slow evaporation method is a much better way of growing high quality crystals (for amateurs). This is because the growing conditions are much more controlled and stable. More details in the FAQ at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Procedure**\n\nThe ideal procedure for growing crystals vary depending on which compound you are using. This is a pretty standard one that will give you decent crystals. I will be using alum salt as an example. Change the mass of salt and volume of water as you see fit.\n\nPart A: Growing your seed crystal.\n\nA seed crystal is a small crystal that serves as a foundation with which you use to grow a bigger crystal.\n\n1. Weigh 9g of alum and dissolve it in 50 ml of hot water.\n2. Stir the solution until all the salt has dissolved. If some salt refuses to dissolve, you might have to reheat the solution.\n3. Filter the solution with a coffee filter into a shallow dish.\n4. Wait for the solution to cool to room temperature. You can place it in the fridge to speed things up, but in most cases, it leads to the formation of low quality, misshapen crystals.\n5. Wait 1-2 days for small crystals to form. OR\n6. Sprinkle a few grains of alum powder into your solution to induce small crystals to form.\n7. Let the tiny crystals grow to at least 5mm in size. This should take a few days.\n\n[An example of some alum seed crystals. Note that the top middle one is of the highest quality.](https://preview.redd.it/xp8agacmj7551.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2504ec566547c58ba1c2a8841b4e12289b3fbb8a)\n\nPart B: Growing a nice, big crystal\n\nMethod I: Slow cooling\n\n1. Weigh 22g of alum and dissolve it in 100 ml of hot water to form a **supersaturated solution**.\n2. Stir the solution until all the salt has dissolved. If some salt refuses to dissolve, you might have to reheat the solution.\n3. Filter the solution with a coffee filter into a jar.\n4. Wait for the solution to cool to room temperature.\n5. Using tweezers, pick the most perfect seed crystal you grew in Part A you can find and tie a knot around it using a nylon fishing line or thread.\n6. Tie the other end to a pencil/stick.\n7. Slowly immerse the seed crystal until it is suspended in the solution in your jar.\n8. Loosely cover the top of the jar.\n9. Keep it in an undisturbed place.\n10. Wait for your crystal to grow.\n\nMethod II: Evaporation\n\n1. Weigh 18g of alum and dissolve it in 100 ml of hot water.\n2. Stir the solution until all the salt has dissolved. If some salt refuses to dissolve, you might have to reheat the solution.\n3. Wait for the solution to cool to room temperature.\n4. Sprinkle some alum powder into the solution to induce crystals to form.\n5. Wait 2 days.\n6. Filter the solution using a coffee filter into a jar. We want the **saturated solution**. The crystals formed from Step 4 are not important.\n7. Using tweezers, pick the most perfect seed crystal from Part A you can find and tie a knot around it using a nylon fishing line or thread.\n8. Tie the other end to a pencil/stick.\n9. Slowly immerse the seed crystal until it is suspended in the solution in your jar.\n10. Loosely cover the top of the jar.\n11. Keep it in an undisturbed place.\n12. As the solution evaporates, your crystal will begin to grow.\n\n[Growing an alum crystal using the slow evaporation method, by u\\/crystalchase21](https://preview.redd.it/66nmvz6k39751.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11423b84a4c21ab0b8259e16321eacbc78137bb8)\n\nPart C: Drying and storing your crystal\n\n1. When you are satisfied with the size of your crystal, remove it from solution.\n2. Dry it with tissue paper/filter papers. **Do not wash it or you will cause it to dissolve.**\n3. Store it in an airtight jar.\n\nSome crystals are unstable, and when exposed to air, will slowly crumble in weeks or months. Copper sulfate is one such crystal. Meanwhile, alum and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate are much more stable and can be kept in the open with minimum deterioration. You can even display them.\n\nAnd you’re done!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Classic Crystal Growing Compounds**\n\n[Top left: Alum; Bottom left: Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate by u\\/dmishin; Right: Copper sulfate by u\\/crystalchase21](https://preview.redd.it/aulick2pj7551.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6500ac325f0a67b1c1ada75f2e875a35814c050)\n\nIf you’re just starting out, we highly recommend these chemicals as they are easy to work with, grow quickly and give good results.

The 301 is still decent close range but not on the lvl of the flatline which consistently 1 clips from the hip, meaning its strength is still mid range.

The same goes for Meldar Prime. The Nanobots, Shirley, and Evil Jimmy were all your creations. You caused the ice age. You created the sentient pants. You made the sick patch, you turned your teacher into a fifty-foot monstrosity, and you injured Santa Claus, almost ruining Christmas.\n\nThe vast majority of this town's problems are caused, at least indirectly, by you. And you know what? In all honesty, that would be fine. You are very intelligent and you almost always do fix it, and in the end it's extremely unlikely that you won't end up benefiting the world a lot more than you will damage it. My children and my children's children are probably going to live in a world free of war and disease, and I'll have you to thank for that.\n\nBut fuck, dude. You can't keep using your intelligence as a way to escape your humanity. I didn't ask you to say salt because I thought a customer would seriously care or because I was insecure, I did it because it made you look weird and I was trying to get you to adopt behaviors and use language that makes you come across like a normal fucking person.\n\nEveryone knows what sodium chloride is, but calling it that outside the context of a chemistry class makes you seem like someone who defines themselves solely by their intelligence, which is undeniably who you are. I know you think that there's nothing wrong with being that person, dude, but there is. Taking your IQ and deciding that it elevates you above the rest of the planet is an awful decision that will lead to a life filled with misery and alienation. It will color every interaction you ever have and make it impossible to have real friends or relationships.\n\nI’m not saying that you won’t have any. But they won’t hold any meaning to you, and they certainly won’t bring you any happiness. Sure, you’ll probably manage a pity-fuck or two your sophomore year of college after giving some drunk sorority girl a jetpack ride, but it’ll bring you nothing but emptiness. Maybe you’ll eventually abandon women altogether and decide that “your true love is science”, secretly seething inside whenever you see a guy like Nick or Bolbi getting married to someone he really cares about, who cares about him.\n\nYou’ll say I’m exaggerating, but dude, look at how you treat the people in your life now. Carl and Sheen, quirks aside, really do see you as a friend, and they’d go through some serious shit if it meant helping you out of a scrape. Can you say that you see them the same way, as anything other than the only two kids your age willing to put up with your ridiculous ego? What have you ever done for them?\n\nInventing doesn’t count, dude. Even when you build something for someone else, you’re really doing that for YOU. Every llama-bot or Ultra Lord simulator is only created with the expectation of further praise. They’re not friends to you. They’re worshippers.\n\nAnd your parents? Lord, the way you treat them. You think I’ve got folks that care about me the way your mom and dad do, working in a shithole like this? I wish. Everyday your dad watches you scarf down the dinner your mom slaved to make for you and prays that you might think about spending some fucking time with him instead of disappearing into your lab to do god knows what. They watch you toy with dimensional-warping science that they can’t wrap their minds around on a daily basis and you laugh at them for worrying about you.\n\nHave you ever played catch with your dad, Jimmy? Ever asked him how his day at work was? You don't have a clue what I'd do for a dad like yours in my life, dude.\n\nWhat about your mom? Why not invent something that’ll make her life easier instead of gallivanting around the Bermuda Triangle to play with fucking seaweed?\n\nWe both know the reason. She would thank you for it, she’d be happy to imagine a version of you that thought for an instant about the needs of another person, but she wouldn’t call you the greatest thing in the universe for it like your friends do. And in Neutron’s world, whoever doesn’t do that might as well not exist.\n\nIgnore me if you want. Keep going the way you’re going, and I’ll see you in thirty years, lugging around sixteen Nobel prizes in your pockets as if they could substitute for a lifetime’s worth of human love and interaction. You’ve always mocked Calamitus for his inability to finish what he started, but the man had a wife and a daughter that tolerated him enough to want to stay in his life through everything, and at the rate you’re going I’d be amazed if you could manage the same with Goddard.\n\nThe rest of Retroville, Jimmy, they’ll never be able to do what you do. They’ll never be able to invent rockets or solve cold fusion or add three numbers together. But they will find genuine friendship and love, and they will call it salt, and despite everything you accomplish you’ll only be remembered as nothing more than the man who wouldn’t. Who couldn’t, perhaps.\n\nGet out, dude. You’re fired.",

Just under 1$ per kilo.\n\nAnyway  \nDishwasher Salt vs Table Salt: What’s The Difference?  \nDishwasher salt differs from traditional salt in several different ways, one of which is its size. Table salt granules are ground to a smaller and finer consistency, which can result in clogged drains when used inside a dishwasher. Dishwasher salt, on the other hand, is thicker and doesn’t the disturb the unit’s normal cleaning operations.  \nAnother major difference between dishwasher salt and table salt is its chemical structure. Dishwasher salt is typically made of 100% sodium chloride with no other additives, whereas table salt often contains anti-caking compounds like magnesium. The additives used in table salt may interfere with the dishwasher’s mechanical components or promote the production of hard water stains.",

    "body": "Yes then ladies and gents, I hope your Tuesday is going as good as mine. I thought it was only fair for me to update you after the insane support I got on my previous post. I really appreciated the kind words and support, it’s genuinely made my week, like honestly. I didn’t realise it had blown up as much as it did. I would’ve updated you sooner if I’d have known; so apologies for those of you that had thought I’d died haha!\n \nOk, so… After I saw someone had posted “Fut Track” as an app to track my WL off, I went into game numero uno right around 06:30am. I tracked all the goals, assists and W/L’s over the course of the 29 games I played. (I gave my last game away as I couldn’t achieve the next rank and the guy genuinely gave me the dance celebration and paused it for me to quit. It was a bold move, especially in Champs. It almost enticed me to play the game out but I decided to be the bigger man as I was absolutely fried, it was nearly 10pm. But you’ve just got to love this community!)\n \nThe first 8 games went by super quick, the connection was like nothing I’ve ever had before. I cannot recommend the early hour’s gameplay enough. It was CLEAN. Everything was doing exactly what I wanted. Believe me when I say it doesn’t always go as well as those did. I got 7 RQ’s and a 5-0 win when the guy rubber banded his controller for the 2nd half all before 8am. My rule of thumb for hitting Elite is if I can hit 8-2 as a minimum on a Friday, 16-4 as a minimum on Saturday, I can always give Elite a good go. So being 8-0 after an hour and a half I had the momentum on my side and I was genuinely flying.\n \nMy team is decent, I made a post a few months ago explaining just how to achieve a decent team without spending £ titled “GUIDE: The most effective way to run your FUT21 account for free.” This definitely has an impact on RQ’s. If you go 2 or 3 goals behind against a player with a decent team when they aren’t experiencing delay, it’s usually game over and I was on the right side of this and feeling frisky.\n \nNow with the Xbox Series X/S FIFA21 community, after about 10 games you start matching with players who you’ve usually played before in previous weekends as the player pool is quite small at a decently positive ELO at the moment. I always write down the gamertags of players who absolutely slap me up, usually I’ll enter their name on FUTWIZ too so that I can see if they’ve ever been verified.\n \nEnter “Nemesis #1” (N1 for short). N1 is a bit of a whopper. N1 loves a cheeky emoji message after a game. N1 has been verified on FIFA19 and in all honesty, he plays the game very well rather than the beautiful football you’d prefer. What I mean by this, is that he is someone whose playstyle is adapting to how the game wants you to play each year. N1 will try and exploit absolutely everything in his power to win. That’s fine, you do you. It’s a game and everyone can play like that if they so choose. But for me, it leads to a game where I have to be totally ON IT to win. I don’t play anti-meta and I’m definitely a sweat also, Mbabu is my LCB, I don’t have a high horse. I play a flat 442 Sir Alex Ferguson style. Always have, always will. He played 4312 counter attack. I had 76% possession and lost 2-1. I had 4 significant chances, he had 3. N1 gave me a kiss emoji and sent me on my way, 8-1.\n \nI was okay, a bit gutted to lose my first game, but okay. A huge thing in gaming that I’ve learnt in my 26 years on this planet is that your mentality is what matters past a certain skill level. It’s the same with athletes and sportsmen etc. Keeping composed is essential for success. I give myself the rule of 2. 2 losses in a row and I have to physically do another activity for 30 minutes before returning.\n \nThe next 5 games were sweaty. I won all 5 by 1 or 2 goals, coming from behind at 10-1 and 11-1 to secure those sweet, sweet dubs felt good. The retribution I felt after winning the 11-1 game after being 2 goals behind to what can only be described as a genuine torture method of crossing the ball to 98 CR7 repeatedly almost provoked a lack of judgement on my part. I nearly became N1. I typed out the kiss emoji ready to send it and just as I was about to, he messaged “GG you’re sick, what’s your rank?” Boys and girls, I felt ashamed. I went to the toilet for a wee and had a hard look at myself in the mirror as I pretended to wash my hands. I don’t know why I do that, I don’t even live with anyone. Keeping up appearances I guess.\n \nI sit back down after my pep talk and it’s about 10:30-11am and I say to myself I’ll carry on until I lose 2 in a row and take a break for a bit. I’ve got twitch on in the background and I start to hear people complaining about the gameplay. That’s odd, it been fine. I enter the next game and it’s like I’ve moved to dial up connection, I swear I can even hear the weird buzzing noises it used to make. I lose 1-0. I didn’t create anything, neither did they. I tried skipping the replays after they had a long shot but the connection was absolutely dog water and I passed it to my CB and you know the drill. I was absolutely livid. My body temperature reached the highs of the Sahara. I shouldn’t have queued up again but I’d said to myself 2 in a row just 20 minutes ago so I enter game #16 at a respectable 13-2. 5-0 down before half time, feeling absolutely brilliant. I honestly don’t mind losing to someone like this. They weren’t verified though and they had Isak and Fekir up top. I got blasted. 8-1 in the end, always get my token LewanGOALski goal though.\n \nBREAK TIME. I gave myself until midday to chill out. I started watching that Asia Qualifiers on twitch to spark some new creativity and learnt the power of the first time fake shot. Trick is to load up the fake shot straight after the pass. Cool. I’ll give it a go. Can I just say if you have someone who’s a little bigger than the meta like Lewa then this skill move is OP AF. Fake shot the 90 degree reverse angle from where the ball is played and you create this like step/speed boost combo with a big player who just bodies/bundles through the opposition defensive line and then because both of my ST’s have 5* WF it’s a simple across goal finish every single time.\n \nMidday hits and I’m 13-3. I need to win 3 and only lose 1 to have a realistic chance for Elite in my last 10 games and that’s exactly what I get. I win 3 in a row with a quick RQ in the 2nd game and then lose the 4th game 2-0 to a better player. I’m 16-4 at 1pm and I’m happy. Usually I don’t play my Sunday games until the evening anyway and I’ve just had a loss so I break for lunch. I do intermittent fasting so only drink black coffee before 1pm so it seemed a natural time to break for food. I give myself until the latest 4pm until I sit down for my final 10. I’m conscious I’ve played 20 games of fifa already and don’t want to be playing too late, but the first 8 were so quick I felt ok. I could tell I was a little tired but no cause for concern at this stage.\n \nI go for a little walk before returning whilst listening to some absolute bangers such as “Toploader – Dancing in the Moonlight” and “Funky Town – Lipps. Inc” as the standouts and again give myself a little pep talk before embarking on the final 1/3 of my games. I return ready and refreshed after my lunch etc and sit down again just before 3:30pm.\n \nI proceed to play my best fifa of the day in this next little 2 hour session. I won 5 out of 5 games from 16-4 to 21-4. This little first time fakeshot trick I’ve incorporated is doing absolute wonders. It just gives me that extra yard. I’ve always had skills in my gameplay and used them effectively, I use all the meta skills but I’ve never done a skill cancel in my life. However, this first time fakeshot almost feels unfair as you can just change trajectory so fast and unnaturally. I think this session here was the catalyst for getting the rank I got. I think even if I’d have lost 1 game of these 5, things would have been wildly different. I could feel myself lagging in my brain. I was winning and I was playing well but sometimes I’d do something really stupid and when I’d look up after the game the actual real world looked different. I almost felt like I was in a video game because I’d just been concentrating for such an extensive amount of time, it’s really hard to explain the feeling I’m trying to describe, I almost just didn’t feel real.\n \nNow for me 17:30-18:30 GMT is an absolute no go for gameplay unless you literally cannot play at any other time, it’s just too heavy. So naturally I break again but I start to genuinely get a bit anxious about playing my last 5. I’m 21-4 and need 2-3 for Elite. Surely I can’t bottle this.\n \nI queue up for game #26 and I match Nemesis #2. (N2) I’ve played this guy every week. We must live really close and our schedules must just match up. I’ve never beaten them. The closest I’ve come is pens. I don’t even know half the combos they do, there’s that many skill cancels, skills, skill cancels, skills etc etc etc that they basically just teleport across the pitch. I lost 4-1. I could tell I was tired. It’s usually a bit more competitive. They messaged me “GG see you next week” and I replied amicably also, even if it wasn’t a GG. I could taste the sodium chloride in my mouth. I can’t bottle it. I’ve come too far. I break again.\n \n7:30pm rolls around (I like to start on the hour or half an hour when I break) and I play game #27 and it’s a nice easy W. 3-0. No qualms. I was better than they were, they had 1 shot and I dominated. I felt relief. 22-5 and I only need 1-2 for Elite young man, come on you got this, I said. Straight into the next.\n \n*nemesis #3 enters the chat*\n \nRed 96 Neymar, Red 95 CR7, Red 92 AWB and Red 95 Varane. What. The.…. EA golden boy or should I say red boy??? I never stood a chance. Usually it’s very close and I’ve won against him before. He’s a top 200 player on a good week but he actually plays football. That’s why I’ve had the better of him before, he takes risks. He plays high depth and aggressive and he’s very very good at it. I lost 9-2. I collapsed. I was absolutely fried after 30 in-game minutes. 22-6. It’s getting tight, just like my suit post lockdown. I break again.\n \nI say to myself I want to be in bed by 10:30pm latest as I was back at school on Monday. It’s 9:30pm and I say to myself win or lose, it’s now or never.\n \nI load into a game and it disconnects at 0-0 27 minutes in, he DC’ed. Not me. Time wasted for sure but at least it’s not a loss. Phew.\n \n*ANTI-NEMESIS ENTERS THE CHAT*\n \nWhat? A full bronze team?! This can’t be rig…. Why’s he scored an own goa…. OH MY GOD PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. I skip the celebrations and low and behold he quits.\n \n23-6!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES BABY WE DONE IT. GET THE RED PANTIES OUT BABY WE DONE IT. YA DON’T MESS WITH THE KING AND IF YOU DO YA DON’T MISS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \nAs stated earlier, I gave the last game away, but only just haha.\n \nIn conclusion, my takeaways are:\n \n1. 30 games is too many. 20 is about the limit for me in a day.\n2. Gameplay is genuinely a living entity that changes fluidly.\n3. Sometimes people can be a bit of a whopper, but so can you.\n4. Check reddit after you post something you ignorant man!\n \nAgain, I really do want to extend my gratitude to all of you who commented/upvoted my previous post it was such a lovely surprise when I logged into Reddit. I honestly can’t thank you enough!\n \nI’ve also just done this all on mobile in a free period, I would like to show everyone my FUT Track for the weekend league but I don’t seem to be able to do a picture and text at the same time on mobile. I’m about to have a parent’s evening also but will check the comments (if any) later to find a fix!\n \nThanks everyone and please stay safe!",

I think you clearly enjoy the challenge and have a healthy mindset but those of us who get tilted trying to compete probably need to zoom out and evaluate just what the hell we really want out of this game.

Pretty much all of those were marathon Sunday sessions with breaks (a few times I played 5 on Saturday... for two weeks, I was starting at 0). Twice, I was pushed into the final 5 matches (Prem and Ultimate), both times still needed 2 wins, and feeling frazzled at how much worse I was doing than normal. Both times I had someone give me a free win, so I know that feeling you got in game 29! It was even more gratifying considering I've given away all my remaining games each week.

    "body": "Everyone probably has seen the newly revealed \"The Witch Queen\" expansion armor.\n\nWell i did some research, and i found some things worth noting.\n\nFirst of all the middle guardian armor references Sodium Chloride or salt,\n\nThe right represents Sulfur and we can also see that it has the atomic number of sulfur.\n\nThe left one has number 80 the atomic number of mercury.\n\nWhat many of you probably don't know is that alchemist start their journey at their body(Salt) to purified it to true salt with the other elements. They are btw called elements.\n\nNow the salt element is explained as follows:\n\nsalt stands for condensation, crystallization, and the underlying essence of a body.\n\nKinda sounds like stasis to me, us starting out on this darkness adventure unlocking the darkness within ,becoming literally frozen and then breaking the ice to unlock our darkness powers. In alchemy they also believe you have to break down your body to get to the core because your body or salt as they believe is made out of mercury and sulfur. If this is indeed right this could mean the others are upcoming darkness subclasses\n\nThe other 2 are explained as follows:\n\n\\-(mercury) mercury was thought to transcend life/death and heaven/earth.\n\n\\-(sulfur) Sulfur was used to denote the expansive force, evaporation, and dissolution\n\nI think the mercury one will be the next subclass because mercury is all about the mind like Savathun she sought to transcend life and death with Nokris and in the presage mission we hear the voices of the dead. The prophecy dungeon has a place called heaven and hell which reminds me of the heaven and earth.\n\nAnd also what does a witch do she makes poison,many us expect a poisonous subclass in the witch queen expansion. What is mercury? Very poisonous.\n\nAnd then in lightfall we will probably unlock the sulfur subclass, the core darkness one , what does the darkness do? it expands, evaporates and dissolves the light.\n\nAlso about salt being stasis, look at how beyond light focused on exo's ,literal bodies made out and vex milk and they later added darkness(clarity) but still the exo bodies do have certain malfunctions and degrade over time. Of course if we follow the alchemical explanation that is very logical because the body (pure) salt is build out of mercury (mind) and sulfur(spirit) what is it that the exo's have problems with, their memory mind and their spirit/personalities that change. Which aren't like they should b hence the malfunction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ErrantStriker](https://www.reddit.com/user/ErrantStriker/) also pointed out that the seven pointed star and/or the seven armed galaxy   could be referring to the 7 planetary metals in alchemy and considering that 6 of the 7 planets mentioned are, or at least where, in game, wether directly or via their moons, leaving Venus as the only one that isn't in game (yet).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n\\-Wikipedia pages for Salt,Mercury and Sulfur\n\n[https://www.thoughtco.com/tria-prima-three-primes-of-alchemy-603699](https://www.thoughtco.com/tria-prima-three-primes-of-alchemy-603699)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical\\_symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol) link with symbols contributed by\n\n[TheDaVinciCrust](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheDaVinciCrust/)\n\nAlso thx to [Tichrom](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tichrom/) for pointing out that Salt is Sodium Chloride in English. I thought it was Natrium like in Dutch.",

        "body": "Its been a while but in recent dlc's and such i think we can edit this theory. I guess i was sortta right and sort of wrong. I think void,solar,arc respectively represent  mercury, salt, sulfur. The witness tried creating the final shape, the philosophers stone which is assumed to be the perfected form of what it touches. Where as guardians were able to fuse light and dark in a better way a living way that transcends that of the philosophers stone.\n\nIn alchemical allegories, the quest for the Philosopher's Stone often involves mythical or symbolic journeys where spiritual or material transformation occurs. These allegories sometimes feature symbolic figures who guide or WITNESS the alchemical process, embodying principles of observation, enlightenment, and mastery. \n\n  \nAll this time the traveler has been Hermes Tresmegistos and the winnower has been Charon. \n\nThe light given by hermes who travels and teaches alchemy and charon who brings people over the rivers of the underworld. Just like how we go beyond to get darkness.  Cocytus was Stasis our darkness version of salt.  Clarity is passing  Lethe.  The deepsight is remembering and represents the Mmnemosyn. Strand is the styx. the styx is the river that connects the world with the underworld but is also the river that connects all rivers into a lake. Its like strand everything is connected and at the same time its the veil of the darkness. the light can only be connected through darkness through that veil. Acheron is the river of sorrow and likely the type of darkness that Nezarec   used and that still flows in the moon's pyramid.     I think prismatic is our guardians answer to the proposed final shape of the witness.  Phlegethon i think is the river that represents the darkness in the hive. The hive magic and their dark rituals.  I kinda asked chatGPT too and this was the answer  Phlegethon, known as the river of fire in Greek mythology, could potentially symbolize a destructive or purifying aspect of darkness in Destiny, analogous to a force that cleanses or tests.  So yea this is my main idea. The whole of destiny has been alchemy from the start and the darkness required rivers to be sailed. The cool thing is we haven't discovered all darkness yet i think.  All these rivers represent boundaries of a type of darkness power.  I think the big difference with light and darkness is that light has less subclasses because of its chaos aspect so the classes \"intertwine\" where as darkness has a established order.  The new raid lorebooks also have the names of these rivers btw, i think acheron there  has to do with memories/nightmares that haunt the witness.  The sorrow that it has.  The connection to the books of sorrow. Styx is about its relation to the light and how it connects all of the individuals into 1 being just like how all rivers of the underworld join in the lake that is part of the Styx. I have not unlocked all lore books but i also have phlegethon 1 which has literally sentences that say that bones must be broken to heal them. Just like how to cleanse life and make it stronger it must be fought. What the hive misinterpreted and turned into only the strongest can survive sword logic mentality.      This is what i have so far. Later i will maybe do more research but i think this is basically how i think everything fits together.  Prismatic is the combination of light and dark both the guardian and the witness use and see this. Even cooler is this     \n\n  \nIn some interpretations, the triangle within a circle is seen as a simplified representation of the Philosopher's Stone, the ultimate goal of the alchemical work. The Philosopher's Stone is believed to possess the power of transformation, capable of transmuting base metals into gold and granting immortality or spiritual enlightenment. The triangle within a circle symbolizes the perfected state(final shape) achieved through the alchemical process.\n\n  \nAlchemy seeks to reconcile and harmonize spiritual and material realms. The triangle within a circle can represent the union of spiritual principles (symbolized by the triangle) with material existence (symbolized by the circle), suggesting a holistic approach to spiritual growth and transformation.\n\n  \nThe triangle within a circle can also be interpreted as a microcosmic representation of the cosmos, with the circle symbolizing the universe or cosmos and the triangle representing the three realms (heaven, earth, and underworld) or the three principles of existence (creation, preservation, destruction)    Microcosm is the gun unlocked by the special campaign missions.  \n\n\n\nMostly these three \"creation, preservation, destruction\"  Representing the light and chaos, the witness and the final shape and the darkness/winnower.     Where the witness would preserve all it would not destruct or create. Prismatic preserves beings like the witness would but allows the balance of creation and destruction to change things. \n\n  \na glass or other transparent object in the form of a prism, especially one that is ~triangular~ with ~refracting~ surfaces at an acute angle with each other and that separates white light into a spectrum of colours.\n\nIts basically different perfect shapes as you will but free to change in the way the light choose to go through the prism. Or the way the darker energy choose to.",

The alchemical symbol for gold is VERY much alike a transmat effect that was on eververse the other day. I didn't think about it at that time since the transmat looks like a circular version of a spine or tail of some dragon or wormlike creature if you know what i mean? Look up the alchemical symbol for gold and see for yourselves. Alchemy seems to be the new direction Bungie is leading us into.

    "body": "It all began in the spring of 1987. The flowers blossomed in the hills of southern Mexico - and so did the love of a young couple.\n\nHis name was Juan. Her name was Luciana. They had known each other since the second year of high school, when Luciana caught the eye of the young farm boy, in a way that no other girl had caught his eye before.\n\nLuciana was not easily won over, however, as she was accustomed to the life of a landlords daughter. Though not brought up in an environment of great wealth (by the standards of the truly wealthy), she had experienced a taste of the finer things that life can offer a young woman.\n\nAlas, they were not to be. Not yet.\n\nAs years passed, and relationships came to and passed forth, Juan and Luciana crossed paths again. Juan, as it turned out, had a flair for business, and had become something of an entrepreneur. He had grown his family's farm into something much more, and now owned several agave farms that supplied a distillery which he owned a large share in. His tequila was the 2nd most exported brand to the United States, and highly regarded among the populace of his native land.\n\nAnd so it came to be that Luciana married Juan, as her father now approved of the man whom Luciana had known in her youth, for his wealth was obvious, and her shallowness unfathomable.\n\nFor several years they lived in a blissful happiness - for Juan had the woman who he had always yearned for, and Luciana had a man who could buy her all that she desired. This sort of unreciprocated romance, of course, cannot outlast the inevitable flaws in the foundations of their 'love'.\n\nJuan turned his attentions toward to his work. He became obsessed with making more money, afraid to ever return to his humble origins. Afraid of losing the woman that he was losing more and more with each business trip he left on.\n\nLuciana's vice was much less productive - but somewhat ironic - as she too turned to Juan's work, or at least the final product. She drank her husband's export quality tequila by the crate - she was never sober.\n\nAfter several years of relationship abuse by both parties, neither were under any illusion of love. Juan had several affairs that he kept no secret of. Luciana became a haggard drunk, aged beyond her years; sour and salty like the lemon and sodium chloride that accompanied her self-worshipping libations.\n\nJuan foresaw a divorce, and he knew what had to be done to save the company from liquidation from his future counterpart divorcee - who liked nothing more than liquid.\n\nThe businessman, no longer the husband, awaited for his burden to enter a drunken stupor, as she did like clockwork each and every evening. He guided her to his pickup truck, her vomit on the upholstery was in his eyes affirmation to his premeditated actions.\n\nThey drove to the hills where the flowers once bloomed, but did no more, as it was a barren and loveless winter. Juan found a cliff that he knew would break Luciana past the point where a person may be repaired, and he pushed her off.\n\nJuan's motivations were obvious to all involved in interrogations and investigations alike. He had every motive, and he was quickly sent to trial - the evidence was irrefutable.\n\nThe jury delivered their final verdict. Why did Juan push his wife off that cliff?\n\nTequila.\n\nHe was soon hanged by the neck until dead. His business went bankrupt and his legacy crumbled to dust.",

Friday was even worse I was consistently having to breathe through my nose and out through my mouth until I was finally able to take a full breath, rinse and repeat every 15 minutes or so. I called the Texas state health department(what the cdc site recommended) to find doctors close and cheap for someone with no insurance, at no point did I have a fever or cough just shortness of breath, however my roommate had a cough and was wavering around the fever line earlier in the week so mentioned that, and was told the clinics near me were closed because of covid19, one of them open was only Monday-Friday 8am-5pm and then a drive thru testing site open Monday-Saturday about an hour and a half away but they wouldn’t test unless you had a fever, so basically no regular doctor to see. Saturday I couldn’t breathe at all felt like I had an elephant on my chest and even deep breaths I felt I was maybe getting 40 percent the oxygen I had before and when I went to go to bed it felt like I was drowning while gasping for air. I decided to go to the hospital specifically for my shortness of breath. What a mistake.\n\nAt the hospital the very first thing they did after calling me back before even talking to me was an EKG($419.75) which they said was normal, then to another room where they took my blood pressure, temperature and oxygen saturation, all 100% perfect, so the lady tells me it’s probably anxiety. Then onto another room($2111.75) where two nurses come in and take my blood and swab my throat and violate my nose(you know the feeling!), tell me they are doing a blood count($184+$32 venomous draw), flu test($423) and strep test($187.25) and a nurse will be in soon to do a chest X-ray($524.25). Okay cool but you’re not even going to listen to my heart or lungs? The X-ray technician asks if I’m pregnant or could be and I say no but apparently they did a pregnancy test($266.25) anyways, after the X-ray they say there is an abnormality and could be pneumonia so they need to do a ct scan. Before the ct scan a doctor came in and didn’t say anything to me and just handed me a tube with a mouthpiece and told me to breathe, apparently it was a nebulizer breathing treatment(109x3=327 for nebulizer, 3.86x3=11.58 for albuterol, can understand 3 doses of medicine but definitely only used one nebulizer) which helped a lot but made me super shaky and like my eyes were bouncing and he said that’s normal but would’ve been nice to have been prepared. Then to the ct scan($4472+$775 for contrast+50 saline solution to test iv=$5297) and that came back perfectly healthy and that the X-ray was just showing breast tissue! What a joke! So after that they prescribed me an inhaler then told me they sent my swab off for covid19 testing($389.50 but thought it was supposed to be free) and not to go back to work for 7 days/3 days after no symptoms and should have the results in a week. I had no idea they were testing for it, I definitely didn’t think I qualified but not going to complain, got the results back negative Monday and then a 12000 dollar bill on Tuesday and man I’m fucking down about it. I was thinking like 3500 which is a crazy amount but I literally could not breathe and felt like I was dying for three whole days so felt it was worth it.\n\nOther expenses were blood tests(?) I didn’t know about\nD dimer qn $557.75\nComplete metabolic panel $557.75\nLipase $228.25\nTroponin $483.50\nB-type natriuretic peptide $306\nSodium chloride syrg $10\n\nTotal expense: $12316.58 \n\nI am just in a state of disbelief and honestly I’m having a lot of intrusively suicidal thoughts. I didn’t feel like I was ever given the option at the hospital to say no, they were so concerned about precautionary measures they never stopped to actually talk to me. The doctor/nurse that told me my ct scan was clear/X-ray was just breast tissue/covid19 testing and can’t go back to work didn’t even come in the room! She literally cracked the door open 2-3 inches to tell me this in full gear. I wasn’t even given the chance to ask questions. I just feel like I went for help and they completely took advantage of me, running tests I didn’t ask for and not asking my permission or even telling me what was going on. DOUBLING my medical bill because you’re X-ray tech doesn’t know what boobs are. Then after all that they didn’t even tell me what was wrong, what might be wrong, or what to do to feel better. Literally I paid 12000 dollars for an inhaler.\n\nI never expressed concern that I thought it was Coronavirus, I just literally couldn’t breathe and it was causing me to panic which effected my breathing even more to the point I was genuinely scared I was going to cause myself to pass out and there were no other options but to go to the hospital. Now I wish I would’ve just passed out and hopefully died. They never once checked my id or verified any information, I never signed anything, they were supposed to come talk to me about insurance/billing but then the nurse told me never mind and to leave. They have outdated insurance which I no longer have, so that claim is going to be denied but even with insurance(bcbs) it was still going to be $8362.96. I think that’s the worst part is I don’t know when they are going to actually bill me and expect payment, I don’t know whether to hope bcbs fucks up and pays part off or if I’d have a better case with no insurance trying to call them and lower the price, which I think you can do? I’ve read about people getting medical bills largely reduced but I have no idea how to go about it, especially because I think I was wrongfully charged for things, such as the pregnancy test, the extra nebulizers and covid19 test.\n\nI get that healthcare workers have a lot on their plate and this isn’t really about them but the system that overcharges and makes this type of thing, minimal communication with patient and just keep running tests and running the bill up, acceptable and the norm is disgusting. I feel trapped, depressed and blindsided.\n\nEdit: I just want to say thank you everyone replying! Whether it be explaining why the process went the way it did from a medical perspective, thoughts on how to reduce the bill and resources I can use, and everyone who just is showing a general sense of camaraderie it’s really encouraging that it’s okay to feel the way that I do. I’m overwhelmed trying to reply to everyone but I am reading everything in the bits and spurts that I can handle.",

If that fails, patients can ask whether they can pay  whatever the hospital would have charged someone who was on  Medicare—typically a lower rate. Hospitals and even collections agencies  will often agree to payment plans, or a discount in exchange for a  lump-sum payment.\n\nFrom this article in The Atlantic: [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/hospital-bills-medical-debt-bankruptcy/584998/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/hospital-bills-medical-debt-bankruptcy/584998/)\n\nThis article also sums up most of the other advice I've found pretty well: [https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/negotiate-medical-bills/](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/negotiate-medical-bills/)\n\nAnd I know what you mean. A few years ago, while I was in college, I ended up with acute appendicitis. It got so bad I literally hallucinated for about half an hour that I was in the hunger games and I was being stabbed in the gut over and over. I tried to tough it out until I could go to an urgent care because I didn't want a hospital bill, but I couldn't, obviously, so I drove myself to the hospital. \n\nWithin half an hour of me arriving they had me on a gurney headed to surgery because they said I was right on the verge of my appendix rupturing. Right before I passed out a nurse offered to call my emergency contact (my mom) for me and I asked her to do so. Well, surgery happens, I wake up six hours later to an angry but relieved mom (she still gives me shit for not calling her myself and for driving myself to the hospital while in that condition), and a hospital admin person asking about my insurance situation. \n\nTurns out, my dad, who I thought I still had insurance through at the time, had accidentally let his employer provided health insurance lapse. So, yeah, overall bill was about $15k. I got lucky and my dad was able to take care of it for me, but that really got me rethinking my hardcore republican (at the time) beliefs. Still makes me angry that if I'd been less privileged I might have been an unemployed college student, barely scraping by even with student loans, saddled with a sudden $15,000 because I decided I'd rather not die an excruciatingly painful death.\n\nI hope that things turn up for you soon, OP.

If you have very thick breast tissue that monotony clouds the image, with the high pre test probability of COVID, follow up CT scan to rule it out. With the potential to have PE based on symptoms: get contrast to double check. \n\n-anxiety: this is rough because anxiety makes you r body physiologically act like it is under attack, the result is that patients can look like they are having many other very physically dangerous problems.

I agree with everyone else on their advice on here ).\n\nI was surprised though because I went to the doctor with the exact exact same \nconditions,you described what I said perfectly (yawning, tired, no deep breaths, dizzy for no oxygen?, chest pain) it’s super scary!! Especially by the end of the day and at night-I was worried I wouldn’t wake up, and I had no other issues (like you said).\n\nThis has happened to me twice now. Once over the summer and once recently (I also was super worried) and all tests came up clean-they ran 1,000 tests on me too-including D dimer which is to check for clots I guess.\n\n  \nI still don’t know what causes this and I have a hard time believing it’s entirely anxiety-especially because it shifts towards the evening. Anyways, if I find out any additional causes I’ll message you in the future, cause it’s \nsuper scary to experience and it doesn’t seem like they can help it that much\n\n Sorry for the long comment, was just surprised to see someone else dealing with this. I hope you are able to able to get some reductions of the bill too...",

        "body": "Several steps to help here.\n\n1 - Ask for an itemized bill (yes, it is different than the one you currently have). Just doing that will drop your bill from 12k to about 10-11k, but it could take a week or two for them to get it to you. \n\n2 - After you get your itemized bill, meet with someone in the the billing department (You may not be able to do this in person with the coronavirus, but try to do it in person if possible). Inform that person that you do not have insurance and you are unable to pay that 12k bill. Ask for a significant bill reduction. Suggest $3500 as a reasonable bill. Then tell them you understand that may take some time (days, weeks, etc) and leave.\n\n3 - When you get the new bill, call them back and negotiate. Point out line items on the bill. For example: If a line item is \"Ibuprofen - $21, Administration of Ibuprofen - $55.\" Negotiate this. Counter with $1 for the Ibuprofen + administration of it. That $266 pregnancy test - you should counter with $10. That is how medicare and private insurance do this (albeit they do it in advance) - you should do the same.\n\n4 - Make a counter offer after negotiating and getting a new total. If your new bill is 6k, offer 3k. Go from there. Make them know that if they don't drop your bill, you will not be able to pay. However, if they do drop your bill to a reasonable amount, you will pay with your credit card right now, over the phone. Do NOT offer to make payments - if you do, your bill will go right back up to 10k.\n\nBackground - I have extensive knowledge of billing from the inside at the administration level. \n\nReasoning - Medicare would pay about 2k of that 12k bill. Private insurance would pay 3-4k of that 12k bill. With enough leg work, phone calls, etc you will be able to get it close to the private insurance rates. $3500 is not out of the question, but I would expect 4k at the end of the day.\n\nBreakdown of some of the items you listed and how much it would cost your insurance company. This is what you should try to pay for each of these things:\n\nCT Scan - $5300 billed (Medicare would pay $300-350, private insurance \\~$500)\n\nPregnancy Test - $266 (Medicare would pay $10-20, private insurance $10-50)\n\nEKG - $420 (Medicare pays $50-100, private insurance $100-200)\n\nXrays - $524 (Medicare pay varies, private insurance $10 per Xray - multiply it by the number you received)\n\nBlood tests- $2100 (This varies based on whether they sent it out, did it in house, etc. Between $100 and $1000)",

They have this leeway for obvious reasons, but if you challenge them at every step you need to watch you do not cross the line into refusing treatment.\n\nThe breast tissue vs x-ray issue varies from individual to individual (some people's tissue shows as more opaque than others) so it is more a matter that the radiologist guessed wrong or you are like my wife and the x-rays are always hard to read or my father that has scarring on his chest that makes the lungs hard to gauge on a chest film.

We throw away the ones that don't work, the pieces that don't fit, and we keep the lucky ones as our favourite guns.\nBut aparently we can't have nice things. \n\nYou've gutted a pre-existing perk - suddenly invalidating the ton of weapons we've been collecting. Anyone remember the player who rolled a miraculous Launcher with -100% durability decay? Lol not anymore - because you gutted durability perks immediately after. Yeah, that launcher was something of an extreme case - but instead of fixing that issue in particular, you fucked the perk on all existing weapons. Your response time on killing this perk was amazing, by the way. Hey, are shurikens fixed yet?\n\n\"But crit damage was buffed\"\n\nBut the dedicated playerbase threw away all our weapons with just fucking crit damage, because it's shit. Our pre-existing collections are getting fucked on the excuse that the trash we already threw away is 'more viable'. You have no goddamn respect for the time we've already put into collecting our weapons.\n\nNow we can't have nice things. We can't have a fun and exciting weapon that we treasure, because Epic is liable to rollback and retroactively nerf our Nice Things.\n\nI wouldn't be _nearly_ as fucked off if this didn't effect weapons retroactively. That way, we'd be able to keep our existing collections and re-evaluate future rolls in light of the new perk changes. I have no idea if this change to crit is retroactive - but knowing how Epic's handled perks in the past, I'm not optimistic.\n\nTL;DR Nothing is sacred when Epic can retroactively screw our favourite pre-existing weapons on a whim.",

The same goes for Meldar Prime. The Nanobots, Shirley, and Evil Jimmy were all your creations. You caused the ice age. You created the sentient pants. You made the sick patch, you turned your teacher into a fifty-foot monstrosity, and you injured Santa Claus, almost ruining Christmas.\n\nThe vast majority of this town's problems are caused, at least indirectly, by you. And you know what? In all honesty, that would be fine. You are very intelligent and you almost always do fix it, and in the end it's extremely unlikely that you won't end up benefiting the world a lot more than you will damage it. My children and my children's children are probably going to live in a world free of war and disease, and I'll have you to thank for that.\n\nBut fuck, dude. You can't keep using your intelligence as a way to escape your humanity. I didn't ask you to say salt because I thought a customer would seriously care or because I was insecure, I did it because it made you look weird and I was trying to get you to adopt behaviors and use language that makes you come across like a normal fucking person.\n\nEveryone knows what sodium chloride is, but calling it that outside the context of a chemistry class makes you seem like someone who defines themselves solely by their intelligence, which is undeniably who you are. I know you think that there's nothing wrong with being that person, dude, but there is. Taking your IQ and deciding that it elevates you above the rest of the planet is an awful decision that will lead to a life filled with misery and alienation. It will color every interaction you ever have and make it impossible to have real friends or relationships.\n\nI’m not saying that you won’t have any. But they won’t hold any meaning to you, and they certainly won’t bring you any happiness. Sure, you’ll probably manage a pity-fuck or two your sophomore year of college after giving some drunk sorority girl a jetpack ride, but it’ll bring you nothing but emptiness. Maybe you’ll eventually abandon women altogether and decide that “your true love is science”, secretly seething inside whenever you see a guy like Nick or Bolbi getting married to someone he really cares about, who cares about him.\n\nYou’ll say I’m exaggerating, but dude, look at how you treat the people in your life now. Carl and Sheen, quirks aside, really do see you as a friend, and they’d go through some serious shit if it meant helping you out of a scrape. Can you say that you see them the same way, as anything other than the only two kids your age willing to put up with your ridiculous ego? What have you ever done for them?\n\nInventing doesn’t count, dude. Even when you build something for someone else, you’re really doing that for YOU. Every llama-bot or Ultra Lord simulator is only created with the expectation of further praise. They’re not friends to you. They’re worshippers.\n\nAnd your parents? Lord, the way you treat them. You think I’ve got folks that care about me the way your mom and dad do, working in a shithole like this? I wish. Everyday your dad watches you scarf down the dinner your mom slaved to make for you and prays that you might think about spending some fucking time with him instead of disappearing into your lab to do god knows what. They watch you toy with dimensional-warping science that they can’t wrap their minds around on a daily basis and you laugh at them for worrying about you.\n\nHave you ever played catch with your dad, Jimmy? Ever asked him how his day at work was? You don't have a clue what I'd do for a dad like yours in my life, dude.\n\nWhat about your mom? Why not invent something that’ll make her life easier instead of gallivanting around the Bermuda Triangle to play with fucking seaweed?\n\nWe both know the reason. She would thank you for it, she’d be happy to imagine a version of you that thought for an instant about the needs of another person, but she wouldn’t call you the greatest thing in the universe for it like your friends do. And in Neutron’s world, whoever doesn’t do that might as well not exist.\n\nIgnore me if you want. Keep going the way you’re going, and I’ll see you in thirty years, lugging around sixteen Nobel prizes in your pockets as if they could substitute for a lifetime’s worth of human love and interaction. You’ve always mocked Calamitus for his inability to finish what he started, but the man had a wife and a daughter that tolerated him enough to want to stay in his life through everything, and at the rate you’re going I’d be amazed if you could manage the same with Goddard.\n\nThe rest of Retroville, Jimmy, they’ll never be able to do what you do. They’ll never be able to invent rockets or solve cold fusion or add three numbers together. But they will find genuine friendship and love, and they will call it salt, and despite everything you accomplish you’ll only be remembered as nothing more than the man who wouldn’t. Who couldn’t, perhaps.\n\nGet out, dude. You’re fired.\n\nBig McThankies from McSpanky's.",

        "body": "Quite the contrary, Skeet. You talk down to me like I’m some sociopathic monster for the way I act, but you haven’t lived even one minute in my shoes. I’m smart enough to invent robots out of toasters and even a rocket ship out of an amusement park ride, sure, but I’m also still 11 years old.\n\nAny 11 year old... no, any person would want to feel like something they feel confident in is worthy of praise and admiration to even the smallest degree. When you were my age, did you not talk for long periods about even the smallest of accomplishments, just hoping for someone to say so much as a ‘good job’ for it? Every time I invent something, I do it because it’s what makes me happy, and I want to feel like the people around me might appreciate it too, and just reward me with a simple acknowledgement that I can be special, that I don’t have to limit myself or my ambitions just to be appreciated, that I can earn them by doing the thing I feel best suits me. \n\nYet, I still have to go to the same school as everyone else my age, even if what I learn there doesn’t stimulate my mind. Everyone moans and groans when I show them something that I dedicated my time to, yet I have to pretend it doesn’t get to me when they just as easily cheer for something as simple as Nick telling a ghost story in class or Cindy pulling a childish prank on me. \n\nOf course I understand that what interests me is not the same as what interests them, but I don’t want to feel like an alien in my own town, never understood by even my own parents. I’ve tried to invent things for them, like orange juice squeezers or window washers, but they just awkwardly smile and lament the fact that now they have to get a new toaster instead. \n\nMaybe it’s selfish to want people to treat me like my gifts means even the slightest bit of anything to them, but, again, let me inquire just what 11 year old wouldn’t want that? And you know what? Sometimes I do get that. Sometimes I can invent something everyone in the town thinks is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but you know what? Science isn’t a guaranteed process. \n\nThere’s bound to be miscalculations and flaws and margins of errors in any experiment, as mine typically have. But suddenly, I’m the bad guy all because I wanted to cool down the heat on a summers day and the town gets stuck in an ice age.\n\n You think I planned for that to happen? No, but it’s the risk that comes from creating something, it can always backfire in some way. But the town doesn’t care if I’ve done good deeds for them, or if I invented something they themselves loved just as much as I did, they just care that it didn’t work out 100% perfectly, and then I’m back to being ridiculed for the things I find passion in. \n\nI don’t blame them to be upset, sure, but this cycle gets tiring time and time again. For once, I just want to hold one conversation with someone that actually keeps ME invested, instead of always having to keep my mouth shut to hear yet again about the 100 millionth episode of Ultra Lord, or about every single species of duck in existence. \n\nI listen, I smile, and I even engage the conversation as best I can, and I think that’s the most a guy can do talking to his friends and family about things he finds little interest in. But the second I want to show off something that I like or talk about something that interests me, I don’t even get a courteous ‘mhm’ and nod while I talk. Instead they just immediately ask me to ‘talk in English’ instead or compromise what I want to talk about, even though I never ask that of them and their topics of interest. \n\nAnd, you know what, that would be fine! All of that could be fine on its own if I wasn’t then instead mocked and ridiculed for being me. I know everyone gets bullied at my age at some point, but at least many of them have the option go off with their friends who share common interests and feel validated for it. \n\nImagine being treated like a total loser just because you can’t play baseball or run track, only to suddenly be treated like an egomaniac when you show off what you CAN do better than them. For some reason, I’m immediately invalidated as a someone worthy of respect the second I’m not good at something, and everyone conveniently forgets whatever cool invention I was able to create a literal week before. So not only are my inventions ignored and treated like bragging or a nuisance when they do get public attention, they also become completely forgotten the second that they don’t. \n\nI’m sorry that I just wanted to be treated like i was special for something I cared about, I only took this job so I could keep following my passions, as I’m certain you’ve done just as well. Don’t forget you’ve hired people that aren’t even old enough to legally work in this country, yet still choose to berate me for oversights I made throughout.\n\nI didn’t know that it was an issue to not push the buttons on the register to confirm an order, and I apologize for not having done so in the first place. But you also threw us kids into a job with little training, and even told me just from a glance that I’m not good enough to work for you. You even talked badly about me to my own friends about my performance, who you may have noticed didn’t even bother defending me. That just goes to prove how little any of you take the time to actually understand my feelings or even stop to ask yourselves why I might try to show off for a little attention so much. \n\nInstead you immediately judge me like everyone else, and I’m sick of having to sit around and just take it. Give me my pink slip, I don’t need to sit around and listen to you berate me, like everyone else in my life has done time and time again. I don’t want to change who I am just because it might make you think less of me, I want to feel like I can be proud of who and what I am. \n\nI’m not giving up on the one thing that makes me feel special and gives me joy just because everyone else thinks it’s annoying. And if that is enough to make everyone hate me, maybe I never needed your conditional love and respect in the first place.\n\nGotta blast.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "After the federation posted every race that the human gene was at least 70% compatible with, I was worried because my race was on the top 5 of that list. But I moved on, for me humans where a little weird and in their language \"quirky\" they had little to no hair in their body walked straight even though they have a slight arched upper back and they ate meat, plants and fungus to the point some human dishes combine everything, they also drink a poison in the morning they called \"coffee\" and use sodium chloride to \"put flavor\" on their food, but little did I knew this was the least weird thing about humans.\n\nI meet Roshka a human infantry male at forth ko'øt\"na a military only base on sector 336 a galaxy 30 lightyears away from my home planet but a googol light-year away from his. We started talking a lot and eventually started dating and after a couple earth years we got married.\n\nAnd then I learned about another weird thing about humans, human genitals are always exposed. I asked about it because I was worried that something so precious to humans was always so exposed he just responded with \"well we use high capacity armored cups in our combat uniforms so no worries here\" this was strange to me because military standard uniforms have medium capacity armor for the chest plate and that's enough to stop a human 50bmg ammunition.\n\nJournal:\n\nToday my husband got a deciese doctors said it was \"the human common cold\" and that he should be good. But I'm worried, he said he was going to die and that he feels horrible, something I didn't even hear when a bullet was embedded in his shoulder. I called his human friend Ratlum to ask for help but he just said to \"give him water and spoon him\" I don't know what to do but I got a spoon from the kitchen drawer.\n\nToday my husband gave me a poison covered fruit because it was \"A day for the lovers and friends\" I want to think it wasn't intentional because yesterday he told me how much he loved me but I'll talk to him.\nTurn out it's a human tradition one day a year a man gives something to their loved ones and that poison was called chocolate and the fruit a strawberry, he then ate one and said \"I'm sorry I didn't knew chocolate was lethal for you\" then he drove me to my favorite restaurant. He hates the restaurant because \"it lacks seasoning\".\n\nToday I entered my mating season of the year, my husband after the chocolate incident decided to learn about it, sadly he forgot one thing, he is my mate and if you don't want to have children in my world the male leave the house that week, he just told me that \"he has rubber\" I don't know what plastic has to do with this but he told me not to worry but I hope I don't get pregnant we are not ready when it comes to money.\n\nGood news I'm not pregnant but he was exhausted today because of that week, so today I did an \"American breakfast\" for my husband with coffee. After he ate he immediately got out from the bed and head to the shower asking me if I wanted to come with. Of course I said yes. I reeked of after mating season pheromones, he told me I smell like roses, a flower from earth. I hope to never smell that flower.",

    "body": "There have been a few posts and comments with questions or misconceptions about the actual birth and postpartum process. I wanted to give my experience as a birth professional.\n\nAs for my credentials, I have been a professional birth doula for 8 years, a postpartum doula for 6, and a childbirth educator for 5. I have been trained in emergency birth skills. I have attended about +250 births, both in hospitals and at home or in a birth center.\n\n1. It is *medically possible* that Alexee did not know she was pregnant. This does happen on rare occasion. However I personally think there is significant circumstantial evidence to show that Alexee had reason to believe she could have been pregnant. She had weight gain, to the point that she was taking or considering (unclear) taking diet pills. Diet pills are abnormal for a girl her age. There have been unconfirmed (as far as I am aware) reports that members of the cheer team and her step father had asked if she was pregnant. She showed deceit by telling hospital staff that she was on her period when she arrived and not cooperating with a physical exam. I am interested to see if her phone was forensically analyzed and if so, what they find on that.\n\n2. According to the health care provider interviews, Alexee and her mother were told that Alexee’s urine pregnancy test was positive. Next they needed to see how far along she was so they took a blood test to check her HCG levels. The farther along in pregnancy you are, the more HCG your body has. The results were taking awhile, and before the test results were back, Alexee runs to the bathroom. There have been questions about why it was taking so long to get the results. This is because she had a full term pregnancy. The higher your HCG levels are, the more the lab has to dilute the sample. Which means the process takes longer. Because Alexee was lying to staff, wearing baggy clothing and not cooperating with a physical exam, the staff was totally unaware of how advanced her pregnancy was. This is not due to stupidity or not doing their due diligence.. it seems (to me) like it was because she was purposely trying to deceive them.\n\n3. Here is a bit of anatomy info if you are not aware. The baby is attached at the belly button to the umbilical cord. This is then attached on the opposite end to the placenta. The umbilical cord provides the baby with oxygen, nutrients and blood from the placenta and also takes waste from the baby and to the placenta to be recycled. All of this is contained inside the amniotic sac which is fluid with amniotic fluid (or the bag of waters).\n\n4. In my professional opinion, she must have acted FAST in order to deliver the baby, sever the cord, place the baby in the trash bag, remove and potentially flush the placenta, and then work on cleaning it all up. In most US hospitals it is routine to administer a drug called pitocin after birth and also gently tug on the cord to to speed up the delivery of the placenta. This still typically takes 15-30 mins. When a provider does what is called “physiological management”, which means not giving meds and not tugging on the cord, this process can take about 30 mins - 1 hour for the placenta to be delivered. In order for her to have accomplished as much as she did in 20 mins, it is my personal opinion that she must have had the baby within minutes of entering the bathroom. Given the way she waddle ran and held her butt on the way there, the head may have already been out by the time she got the door closed. In order to keep the baby quiet (more on this next), she likely worked on severing the cord next so she could conceal the baby before he made noise (I will also address the cord). After placing the baby in the trash bag I believe likely started pulling on the remaining portion of the cord violently, causing the placenta to come out in pieces, which she likely flushed. It would have been difficult to hold the baby or even place him on the floor while keeping him quiet, and pull out the placenta at the same time. This is why I believe she severed the cord and concealed him first, then pulled the placenta out. She had to have severed the cord before concealing him because otherwise the placenta would have been inside of the trash bag with him. As we know from the ER docs interview, she did retain a small portion of the placenta which was removed from her at the secondary facility, but the remainder was not found in the trash can or the bathroom. The entire placenta is about the size of a dinner plate and is the texture of a beef liver. I do not believe it could have been flushed in 1 piece without clogging the toilet and flushing it in multiple pieces is consistent with the nurses stating they heard her flush several times, which prompted them to check on her and retrieve the key to the bathroom.\n\n5. Umbilical cords are really hard to cut, even with hospital grade scissors. They are thick and it takes many cuts of the scissors to get all the way through them. They are also filled with blood right after birth, it takes about 15 ish minutes after birth for all of the blood to drain from the placenta and into the baby’s body. I don’t believe there was time for that because she exited the bathroom in 20 minutes. The cord also pulses, so if it is cut soon after delivery it will spurt blood from the end that is still attached to the placenta. One of the nurses explained that there was blood “sprayed” onto the walls. This sounds consistent with severing the cord soon after birth. How did she do it? I have no idea. I’m not sure that it’s possible to tear it like string cheese, I’ve truly just never seen that barbaric of a method used. She could have chewed it, that’s what animals do. I also saw a commenter theorize that she could have used the serrated edge of a paper towel dispenser if one was in the bathroom. I do think that is also possible. \n\n6. It is fairly common for babies to be quiet at birth, especially in a calmer environment. Now I’m not stating that Alexee was calm, but she was obviously attempting to be quiet. She wasn’t screaming out in pain as many women are. There wasn’t a room full of family and nurses and doctors oohing and ahhing over the baby or rushing about the room. The bathroom was certainly quieter than most delivery rooms. \n\n7. What about the bag of water? Well it could have broken when she was still at home. According to her boyfriend the pain started about 24 hours before. She had likely been in labor for awhile. It’s not uncommon for water to break during pushing because of the immense pressure, so it also could have broken inside of the bathroom. By the time the police arrived she had been given a pelvic exam, so her pants were off. I wonder if they were collected as evidence?\n\n8. Let’s talk about the meds Alexee was given when she got to the hospital. Rosa and Alexee’s attorney have claimed that the hospital was negligent because they gave her three medications that they claim were unsafe for pregnant women. This is just complete and utter bullshit. She was given morphine for pain. This is a very common IV medication used during labor for pain relief. She was also given zofran. Many women are prescribed zofran throughout their pregnancy and it is also used often during labor to treat nausea. The last thing she was given is sodium chloride. This is IV fluids. The vast majority of women giving birth in a US hospital are given IV fluids throughout labor.\n\nAny other questions about the birth side of things? I will try my best to answer them!",

        "body": "Another thing that I didn’t think to mention, but I will edit my post to add,\n\nIt is also possible that the cord can sever on its own. This is a very rare complication of birth called  cord avulsion. I have never seen this type of complication happen first hand and I could not find a statistic for how likely it is. Some risk factors do include a fast pushing stage, short cord, infection, and excessive pulling or pressure on the cord during delivery. Pulling or pressure on the cord could theoretically happen if a mom ran into a bathroom while the baby’s head was emerging, yanked her pants down, and the rest of the baby was born without being properly caught. The gravity of falling onto the floor, in her pants, or even into the toilet could theoretically cause that. (I do think if the baby fell onto a hard surface like a floor it is reasonable to assume that it would have stimulated him to cry unless he was stopped from doing so with a hand or something over his mouth.)\n\nBecause I have never seen this complication I am not sure exactly what the remaining piece of cord looks like when something like this happens. This is a very dangerous emergency scenario for the baby though because the baby can lose blood via the umbilical cord. \n\nIf the defense tries to argue that some life threatening complication like this occurred, the prosecution will be able to easily poke holes in the defense because she was inside a hospital where she could have yelled or rang the call light for help at any moment. As an adult they would have respected any requests to keep the situation private from her family AND as her own defense attorney stated, she is intelligent and has a 3.8 GPA. ( Why would he even state this? He should have continued to let people believe she is stupid and used her naivety as a defense, but I digress…)",

If it snaps you’re just gonna get a piece of cord in your hand and if it snaps too high then you’re screwed because you’re placenta is still attached to the inside of your uterus and there’s no way you’re getting you’re own have up there to dig it out and you would have to have a d&c to get it removed . Some people are super troopers and are MADE to have babies with no medication but the most painful part is the contractions. She was obviously got to completely dilated with mostly no meds. When it’s time to push it is possible that push with no sound. It gives so much relief to push against that pain and pressure that most people are focusing all of their energy on just pushing the baby out. My guess is that the babies head was already on its way out when she ran to the bathroom and you don’t have to have pitocin to get the placenta out. Most docs don’t even like to run pit until the placenta is out so the uterus doesn’t clamp down and trap the uterus in. It can take 30 min for a placenta to pass on its own, but that’s rare. It can happen with 5 mins sometimes. As far as her having morphine or something else when she was waiting, while it is safe to give during labor of its given too close to giving birth it can slow the babies respirations down and cause distress. The baby obviously took a breath so it was a live when it was born but it could be why the baby didn’t cry. \nThis is just my take so no one is given false information. Thats how rumors get started",

I rushed to the hospital and they gave me morphine at the hospital which hardly helped for my pain. When I went to the restroom the fetus came out in the toilet. It was so small, like the size of a shrimp. I immediately called for a nurse to come get it from the toilet. I wanted to remove it myself so badly but I knew they’d need to come see. They scooped it out and we’re able to do testing on it to see what the reason for my miscarriage was. \n\nAfter that I’ve delivered 2 healthy babies. First one they gave me morphine and an epidural. The morphine did nothing to help the pain so I opted for an epidural. My second one they gave me fentanyl before the epidural. This lasted maybe 45 minutes before I was back to feeling the pain and opted for an epidural. I know the pain tolerance is different for everyone, but that “ring of fire” that you feel when the baby is crowning, THAT was the same for me for both births and hurt like hell. \n\nI really cannot wrap my head around how she was able to get that baby and placenta out in 20 minutes. Both my placentas came at least 15-30 minutes after birth. That was after pushing approx 45 mins to 90 mins. \n\nI agree I believe the baby was probably crowning when she ran to the restroom because of the way she’s holding her butt. Either that or the baby had plopped out into her pants? I’ve heard stories of women giving birth in there pants and the under wear catches them. Either way, the mom was in the room with her before she ran to the restroom. If she did think maybe it was a possible miscarriage or the hospital thought that, I can definitely see how they could have missed it. The only person that didn’t know it was a miscarriage was Alexee. She saw that baby when it came out of her. That fully developed sweet little angel. There is no denying what she did was murder. \n\nAlso, my first baby cried when he came out and my second did not. My second didn’t cry until he was poked with a needle.

This one was rejected from the *Journal of Parasitology*, with a note reading “Please do not submit fiction to our journal.” As I remember, Dr. O'Brien started becoming extremely angry and paranoid around this time.)\n\nCase 16\n\nSevere behavioral disturbances in parasitosis.\n\nThe patient was a 34-year-old laboratory technician at our hospital. He collapsed at home shortly after a meal, and was brought by ambulance to our hospital. On admission, he was confused and disoriented. A blood panel revealed marked hyponatremia (120 mEq/L), which was corrected by a slow infusion of sodium chloride along with IV tolvaptan (to prevent osmotic brain injury).\n\nThe patient's wife came to the hospital and was interviewed. She revealed that her husband's behavior had become increasingly disturbed over the last two weeks. She said he had become preoccupied with his health, claiming that he had a fungal infection in his skin, although there was no evidence of one. He had also become extremely worried about dehydration, and had begun to consume water in excess. She reported that, in spite of her warnings, and in spite of his own knowledge of the dangers of excessive water intake, he had been consuming in excess of two gallons of spring water per day at the time of admission. He had also shaved all the hair from his head and body and begun to add small quantities of bleach to his bathwater, all, he claimed, as precautions against lice, scabies, and skin fungus.\n\nBy Day 3, his hyponatremia had been corrected, and his mental status had improved. He constantly demanded water, but in view of his condition, his hydration was entirely intravenous. On interview, he complained of mood changes, insomnia, nightmares (almost always involving drowning), and suicidal ideation (he felt the desire either to drown himself or to consume enough water to cause fatal intoxication). He suffered from constant thirst, and would frequently ask nurses to check his urine output.\n\nThe patient had no history of psychiatric illness, so an endocrine or neurological cause was considered. A hormone panel revealed no abnormalities, and hormone and urine screening showed no evidence of inappropriate excretion of antidiuretic hormone. A head MRI was performed, revealing no masses or lesions. There was no evidence of poisoning or other toxicity. It was decided that the patient was too unwell to discharge, and he was transferred to the psychiatric ward.\n\nThe day he was transferred, the orderlies complained of having difficulty keeping him from the communal water fountain. Despite adequate fluid intake, he would attempt to go to the water fountain as much as sixty times per hour while in the common room, and would have to be physically escorted away. In view of his uncertain diagnosis, it was decided not to transfer him to the locked ward, but rather to temporarily close the shutoff valve on the water fountain. The patient continued to attempt to get water from the fountain for several hours after this, but when it was clear that it had been shut off, he became restless and distressed. He constantly asked the psychiatric nurses for antibiotics, antifungal cream, and hand sanitizer. At least once a day, he asked a nurse or orderly to autoclave his clothing. He believed that his stool consisted entirely of bloody pus, and that he was dying.\n\nOn Day 9, he began complaining of a high fever, but his temperature was 97.9 F. A repeat blood panel showed no elevation in leukocyte count, and there was no evidence of any infection. The patient ate normally and was properly hydrated. He continually asked for extra water. When told that consuming too much water had made him ill previously, he said “I know, but I still need it” [sic]. \n\nA comprehensive psychiatric interview on Day 11 revealed the following:\n\n--A belief that his skin was infected with a fungus or fungus-like organism, which caused an intense burning sensation.\n--A belief that he had a very high fever and was delirious.\n--A belief that the nurse who supervised his fluid intake was poisoning him, specifically with arsenic trichloride. Because of previous incidents of contamination in our hospital, the water and dishware were tested and found to contain no arsenic.\n--Visual hallucinations of tiny white termite-like organisms crawling around in the carpet, in his eyebrows, and on his clothes.\n--A constant feeling of uncleanliness. Because of his previous water intoxication, he could only have supervised sponge-baths, given by a nurse. He constantly complained that these were not sufficient to keep him clean.\n--Worsening nightmares, including nightmares of being trapped in burning buildings, being lost in the desert, drowning in water, drowning in urine and feces, and his body being infested with maggots and grubs.\n--Increasing suicidal ideation (he reported wanting to insert a water hose directly into his lungs and turn it on) and self-injurious behavior (he began scratching his skin aggressively).\n\nOn Day 15, it was decided that he posed a significant threat to himself, and was transferred to the locked ward and sedated with haloperidol. \n\nOn Day 18, it was noted that the patient's appetite had decreased and he was losing weight. He developed urinary incontinence and stopped speaking. The psychiatrist in charge of his case was concerned that he was experiencing side-effects from the haloperidol, which was stopped. This caused no improvement in his condition. However, as it appeared that his self-injurious behavior had ceased, he was returned to the unlocked ward. It was hoped that social interaction might improve his mood, but he remained mute and withdrawn. He continued to lose weight and remained incontinent. He developed a papular rash on his arms and began scratching again. He had to be placed in mittens to prevent skin damage.\n\nBecause of his deteriorating condition, he was placed on olanzapine. However, his condition continued to worsen, and on Day 25, he stood up in the dayroom and suffered an attack of extremely profuse vomiting. The vomitus was yellow and foul-smelling and contained streaks of a pus-like white fluid, copious mucus, and chunks of a cheesy white substance. The patient was returned to the medicine ward and a sample of the vomitus sent to the lab.\n\nBecause of his excessive water intake, his trips to the restroom were supervised. However, on Day 28, the nurse accompanying him allowed him to enter the stall on his own. After several minutes, the nurse noted a retching and banging sound and entered the stall. There, he found the patient slumped over the toilet bowl, banging his head against the tank (to the point of drawing blood), and vomiting a massive quantity of what the nurse described as “spaghetti” into the toilet. He immediately summoned the on-call doctor.\n\nThe patient was found to have vomited a large quantity of long, thin, maroon-colored worms which had formed a tangled mass in the toilet. While he was being removed from the bathroom, a stain was noticed on his gown, and it was discovered that an even larger mass had emerged from his anus. An examination and an abdominal x-ray revealed severe bowel obstruction, and he was taken to the OR for emergency disimpaction.\n\nSurgical exploration revealed a grossly distended colon, small intestine, and stomach, with hematoma, hemorrhage, and ulceration throughout. During the surgery, an enormous number of worms were removed from his GI tract. The worms were long and thin, averaging 1 mm in diameter and 40 cm in length. Approximately 10 kg of worms were removed from his GI tract. In addition, 2 kg had been released in the bathroom. Specimens were preserved and sent to the lab for identification.\n\nAfter the removal of the worms, the patient was empirically started on mebendazole and amphoteracin. His mutism and incontinence resolved, but his other psychiatric symptoms grew worse. He developed an extremely intense fear of darkness and nighttime, and constantly cried out for water. He claimed that his blood had turned to poison, and that his organs were rotting. Olanzapine was tried again without success. Haloperidol was ineffective, as were risperidone, aripiprazole, and clozapine. Because of his worsening distress and unresponsiveness to medication, on Day 80, the psychiatrist recommended ECT. His wife consented, and the patient was given 5 treatments with unilateral electrode placement. Seizures were successfully induced between 100 mC and 400 mC. No cognitive or memory deficits were noted, but there was no improvement in the patient's symptoms. His dosage was increased to between 500 and 1000 mC, maintaining unilateral placement. However, after the second high-dose treatment, the patient's symptoms worsened. He believed that the staff were deliberately torturing him, and his suicidal thoughts became extremely intense and invasive, requiring continuous sedation and physical restraint. ECT was stopped.\n\nThe patient grew increasingly withdrawn. By Day 95, he was nearly catatonic. On Day 103, he expressed a desire to hug his wife, who was visiting him. His restraints were removed. He hugged his wife, then suddenly turned and kicked the attending nurse in the leg, fracturing her kneecap and severely injuring her knee. He threw his wife to the ground and attempted to leave the hospital. His wing was locked down and the elevators disabled. When he encountered hospital security, he threw himself through a plate-glass window and fell four stories onto a grassy lawn. He was pursued by hospital security. He ran for half a mile at an extremely fast pace. Security were unable to catch him, and he jumped into the hospital's cooling pond and floated facedown. A security officer swam out and retrieved him, but he was not breathing, and it appeared he had aspirated a large quantity of water. He was rushed back to the emergency department.\n\nThere, he was found to be pulseless, and severely hypoxic. Intubation was complicated by a severe laryngospasm. When intubation was completed, a large quantity of water was evacuated, and the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position while the lungs were drained. Artificial ventilation was started, but the patient remained hypoxic. During chest compressions, he suffered an episode of ventricular tachycardia which quickly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. He was shocked back to sinus rhythm, but remained pulseless. After five minutes, his hypoxia began to resolve, but he suffered four more episodes of ventricular fibrillation, all cardioverted successfully. After twenty minutes' resuscitation, spontaneous circulation returned, but he was unable to breathe on his own, and was transferred to the ICU. He remained somewhat hypoxic (SPO2 88%) and unresponsive. In view of his prolonged hypoxia, his wife was informed of the possibility of severe hypoxic brain injury. By Day 110, his hypoxia had resolved, and the patient was evaluated. There was no response to noxious stimuli. Pupils were fixed and dilated. Oculovestibular, caloric, corneal, and tracheal reflexes were absent. There was no evidence of respiratory drive. The patient's wife, per the patient's wishes, asked for life support to be discontinued. The patient was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.\n\nOn autopsy, the patient appeared relatively healthy. There was extremely mild cirrhosis of the liver. The only other notable findings were pneumonia and pneumonitis from the water aspiration, brain atrophy consistent with severe hypoxic injury, and a pattern of irritation, ulceration, distension, hematoma, and scarring in the GI tract.\n\nThe lab was unable to characterize the worms recovered from the patient. Specimens were sent by courier service to an out-of-state parasitologist, but the courier was invovled in a fatal motor-vehicle accident and the specimens were destroyed.\n\nOf note, the patient had mailed a letter to himself approximately six weeks before his symptoms began, long before his wife noted any psychiatric disturbances. It appeared pristine, and the postmark confirmed the date of arrival. It said that, in the event that he should die or become ill, even if apparently by natural causes, murder should be suspected. The letter and the patient's case file were turned over to the police. However, the letter did not name any specific suspects, and the investigation is still ongoing.",

I feel there is a sense of varying age in each report, which backs this idea somewhat.\n- there are elements and hints of extra dimensional communion. An initiated front wave of 'turned' individuals may be attempting to assist their segmented masters cross the planes into ours, using innocents as intermediary, even incubative, vessels.\n- repeated failures with the incubation process may have led to the development of techniques and surgeries by which the hosts could be strengthened. This is the purpose of the 'evil hospital'.\n- a limit imposed by the fundamental laws of physics in our universe prevents complex inorganic material from crossing over. This goes some way towards explaining the presence of standard leads and connections attached to unknown, yet clearly manmade, implants. The 'alien' designs must be adapted and tested.\n\nThese theories are clearly too fantastical for serious consideration by learned men.

Only I have been to my local hospital twice, once for breaking an arm and once for appendicitis. This isn't it. The only person I've had any contact with is a male nurse that has checked on me twice and changed an IV, whenever I question him he just replies that a doctor will be with me shortly and will explain everything. I have no recollection passed going to sleep. My left leg is absolutely smashed below the knee, I have a bandaged arm. The only other thing is that my throat hurts incredibly bad making it hard to talk, swallow, etc. All the medical work done to me looks legit, all the machines and tools do as well. I can hear people and phones out of the door and see light peeking through the window although can't see anything else do to thick curtains. But everything seems EXTREMELY off, and just not normal considering other hospitals I've seen although nothing I can truly point to that provides me with any reasonable proof. Please help me and tell me ways I can discover if where I am is legitimate or not.

It is red if that means anything at all. I also took a commenters suggestion and shouted \"Hey!\" a few times. The male nurse came in and said he was giving me something to sleep, this time I asked him his name and he said it was Steven. He left shortly after but quite recently I began vomiting and the back of my mouth tastes metallic, yet I do not feel tired.

They were on the side of my broken leg. The entire pant leg is shredded, torn, and completely fucked. They are also damp. I have no service but can connect to the \"2WIRE881\" open wifi. My phone is mostly smashed and the backlight is out. when I open my browser it asks for a user and pass, most apps will not open the only ones that do are Reddit, E-Trade, and Google Translate. It also keeps restarting. Information on my IV bags \"I can't read very much without my glasses. There are 2 bags, one says \"Sodium Chloride\" the other one I can only see a \"High Alert\" sticker and a yellow \"Caution\" Sticker.\" I am also still vomiting but it is getting better. The room smells awful.\n\nInfo Update 3: I went to bed on Sunday, November 2nd at around 10pm. As pointed out by /u/vvitchhazel the \"Caution\" bag could be Busulfan. Also my clothes were removed a short while ago by a second nurse. I can hear rain. Also to the person who asked about my gown and if they have any writing on them, on a tag near the bottom it says \"SICK B 11\"\n\nUpdate 4: The male nurse returned and gave me \"Dramamine(sp?)\"(I didn't ask him how to spell it) he said it will stop the vomiting. He also hurriedly told me to make no more commotion and just go to sleep. After that he left.\n\nUpdate 5: I have gotten what looks like disgusting canned food, it's the first meal I have gotten here, I have yet to bring myself to eat any of it. I don't I am exhausted but have stopped vomiting, sweating, and being dizzy after the I was given the Dramamine. Still haven't seen a doctor but I can once again hear phones and people's voice outside the door. Sun is coming through the window again but I can still hear rain. It was also brought to my attention that the clothes next to me were NOT the clothes I had went to bed in but actually the clothes I wore prior. I have a much clearer head now but I still have an extreme felling of unease and oddity toward my surroundings. \n\nUpdate 6: /u/SurprisinglySmart has a theory that I may be on board a ship, which at this point actually makes a good amount of sense. I don't know of there is any way to be sure or not, or how to go about testing it.\n\nEdit 7: http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2l8pt4/how_can_i_tell_if_im_in_an_actual_hospital/clt8bbe",

You currently sound like your condition is a bit more critical than your previous hospital visits.. Which would explain a hospital room that looks different.. ICU rooms don't usually resemble more standard rooms. The sodium chloride drip is just to keep you hydrated. As for the wristband, it sounds pretty legit. While they vary from facility to facility, two patient identifiers are necessary: Your name and your date of birth. The M is for male and the string of letters and numbers is your patient ID. It's also not uncommon to need an ID and password to access their Wifi. Also, hospitals usually enforce \"quiet times\" where staff and visitors are asked to respect patients by keeping noise to a bare minimum. If it appears darker and you're not hearing as much commotion, that might be why. I'd also like to note that it's not unusual for your nurse to be scarce. He probably has a heavy patient load and while you're probably feeling anxious and afraid, try to be patient. I work (nights) at a hospital, so that's just my two cents. I could be entirely wrong though and this could be horribly sinister. Let's hope not!",

I agree the other numbers are likely a date.  \n\n* If you're able to see out of the window in your room, do you have a sense of what story of the building you're on.  If you can't see, could you ask your nurse to open the blinds so you can?\n\n* NP is a common abbreviation for \"Nurse Practitioner.\"  I suppose it could also mean \"new patient\" in this context.  \n\n* If you are correct about the drug in your IV being Busulfan, this is not something that would be used in emergency medicine, and it can cause significant side effects.  You would have needed to sign a consent form to receive it.  Call the nurse into your room, confirm the name of the drug, tell him you have no recollection of authorizing this treatment, and demand that it stop and that you speak with a doctor immediately. \n\n* You got a decent look at what you were wearing when admitted.  Were they pajamas?  Casual clothes?  Work clothes?  This might help you determine where you are and what you were doing when your injuries occurred.\n\n* Aside from the shredded pant leg, what condition were the clothes in?\n\n* Look over the unbandaged parts of your body.  Do you have cuts?  Scrapes?  Bruising?  Road rash?  This might provide clues about the situation in which you were injured.  \n\n* I tried Googling the name of the hospital WiFi network you used, and a ton of hits came up, so I'm guessing it's a default wireless network ID used by a router when the person setting it up doesn't specify anything else.  I've never used one before, but Cisco has a \"881 Integrated Services Router\" designed for small businesses and teleworkers.  If that's what the hospital is using (and it's totally unsecured), it's probably a pretty small facility.   If it came from somewhere else, then you're probably in a populated area and close to other buildings.  Did any other network IDs come up as options?  Maybe one of them contains the name of a local business (coffee shops, restaurants, etc.)\n\n* You seem pretty lucid and aren't sleepy.  I'm also guessing you didn't experience mania or psychosis or some kind of psychiatric episode that led to your admission.  If you had, you'd likely have been given sedatives, anti-anxiety drugs, or anti-psychotics, any of which would make you feel drowsy and foggy.  I don't think they would have entirely ceased this medication without a psych consult, and you haven't spoken to a doctor.\n\nEDIT: I checked weather reports, and it has not been rainy in Sacramento.  I've also never been in a hospital where I can hear running water in pipes through the wall, but I guess it's possible.  However, it has been raining in Portland and Seattle, so maybe you moved north but not outside of your time zone?",

(depends on your country's hospital policy). I'm just trying to think of ways that you can somehow estimate the time you've been in there.\n\nWhen you say the nurse took off your clothes that you were wearing that seems suspicious. If you were in an emergency and gone through ED, protocol is to totally expose the patient to fully assess injuries. You would then be given a gown. And I don't think you have to worry about coming from theatre either because you'd also be in a gown. This makes me think that you were somehow just admitted to a ward fully clothed. \n\nMaybe try asking for food, even if you don't eat.

    "body": "Steve questioned if the ride was actually an initial part of the testing.\n\n“What the actual *burble burp bleh* was I thinking.”\n\nHumans don’t take the test, never have. They came onto the galactic scene oh… sixty or so years ago when this group of Xenos wanted to vacation on Antrctica because “The weather was nice” and twenty years since we were told about The Test. The test opens once every orbital cycle, but that’s a different star that spins at a different speed and is at a different orbital distance than Earth, so it works out to about once every four years. The Test is older than everything, even the Xenos that first visited us, and somehow no one has quite pulled it off.\n\n“How the hell did I end up here?” Oh. Right.\n\nAnd then there’s Steve. Steve Bryton, 38 year old standard human, of North America. Steve is a janitor on the orbital platform Linguistically Correct But Ideologically Unsound, in permanent geostationary orbit around The Test.  His job extends to but is not limited to cleaning up after creatures of all races, due to accident or evolutionary product. (Not everybody walks with dry feet. Or feet, for that matter.) On occasion this includes some basic plumbing, pipe fitting, and diagnostics for the waste reclamation systems.\n\nToday Steve is drunk. \n\n“*urp*”\n\nVery drunk. Because The Test has been open for all of fourteen standard earth hours, and Steve and his cohort Xypheris “Rach” Tehtnuche were working shorthanded, as they were half the janitorial staff and the other half called in sick. On the first day of the test. References to bovine fecal matter were made. By galactic labor law they couldn’t work more than twelve hours in a given cycle, and it had taken thirteen to get a temporary crew on hand to cover them. They gleefully abandoned their posts the instant someone else with a mop showed up.\nThis brings us to the station tavern, Enthusiastic Prejudice, so named by the patrons because the liver is evil and must be punished. We find Steve and Rach, a 1.6m tall anthropoid jumping spider if one were making comparisons, sitting in the corner of the tavern getting absolutely destroyed because that’s what you do when a Delvuuriid with a cold decided he wants to tour the entire station. Gastropods. Think giant gastropod with four primary arms, no legs, and are self-lubricating. With a cold.\n\nMore references to bovine excrement.\n\n“Nobody has finished it?”\n\nRach managed somehow to get four of his six primary eyes to focus on Steve. “Nope. Older than forever and no one has finished it. I’m not even sure a human has even tried yet. “\nSteve swayed in his seat ever so slightly. 45 minutes of burning through last week’s paycheck can do surprising things. He looked Rach in between the eyes. “Hold my beer.”\n\nWhich brings us back to Steve, in a four meter pod currently lit by minor ionization combustion caused by eons of minor atmospheric accumulation. \n\nThe mood of the light from outside the craft shifted slightly, from a reddish orange to a dark minty green due to The Tests docking system. The pod shushed to a soft landing then settled into place with not much more than a token ticking noise of the landing feet locking into place. With a soft hiss the seal on the pod opened, and Steve got his first view of the docking bay. \n\n“It’s like being outside. With a roof.”  He considered the vastness of a massive structure that seemed to be completely open for what might have been miles in every direction.  He fumbled with the harness, finally getting it to come unclasped and made to exit the pod, whereupon he tripped over his own feet and came to rest with a vague slapping sound on his face.\n\nThere was a collective groan followed by polite chuckling in the tavern.\n\n“Ow.” Steve leveraged himself up, then looked around trying to find anything that might hint toward what was next.\n\nHe’d been standing for a few seconds when a small green ring appeared on the floor about ten meters in front of him.  Steve walked toward it, pondering what happened next.\n\n“Oh. Well then. If anyone’s still listening, here I go, wish me whatever passes for luck where you’re from.” The video feed from Steve’s pod cut out, as it always did when someone started The Test.\n\nA feminine-ish voice sounded from roughly nowhere. “Ithkea baet, futan losk ybnathek.”\n“Um, can we try that again in post contact Earth Standard English?” Steve wondered while looking up. Looking um seemed to be normal for humans when talking to disembodied voices.\n\n“Welcome to the Testing Facility. You will be tested in a wide range of disciplines in both the physical and intellectual varieties.  Please state your name, age in origin system standard units, system of origin, and species name.”\n\nSteve pondered this for just a moment, which taxed his brain just enough to blink his eyes out of sequence. “Steven Richard Bryton, 38 years, four months,  Earth, Sol system, Homo Sapien Sapien, also known as Human.” Steve pondered for a moment that being able to pass a standard field sobriety test is a gift everyone should have.\n\n“Earth. Tester designate 1. You are the first of your species to attempt the testing process” the voice said.\n\n“I had heard as much, Glados.” Steve grinned.\n\n“Testing system redesignation accepted. You may use Glados as a request initiation cue. Requests for tools or clarification are allowed during the test. Testing begins now.”\n\n“I’m not sure I’m drunk enough for this.” Steve pondered as a small platform with random shaped holes rose out of the floor.  He pondered the holes, then picked up a cut piece with a similar shape to one of the holes. “Can’t be this easy.” Then placed the shape in the hole. \n\n“Test complete. Advancing.” Said Glados.\n\nNothing changed except the holes began to move. As Steve placed more and more shapes into holes the holes accelerated, until Steve had to move fairly quickly to keep up. As he dropped the last shape into the last hole the surface turned green and slid back into the floor.\n\n“Test complete. Advancing.” Said Glados.\n\nSteve lifted an eyebrow. “Ok, what’s next?”\n\n“Resolve.” Said Glados as a single tone began to play, then was accompanied by another.\n\nSteve blinked a few times, tilted his head to the side, then picked his hands up to about waist height, one hand up and the other down. “That… is an E Major chord which resolves with a B. I’m in a band. We suck.”\n\n“Test complete. Advancing.” Said Glados.\n\n“Ok, you can give up on that. Just advance the tests in the future.” Steve mentioned to the nothing in particular he was surrounded by.\n\n“Acknowledged.” At which point the entire deck shifted and appeared to change into a narrow mountain valley. “Identify, pursue, capture.”\n\n“Do what now?” Steve looked up to see something that might have been a sheep if HR Geiger had been the one to design them. About three seconds later it started to walk, then was suddenly surrounded by similar creatures. “Oh. Well, fine then.  Uh… The one I’m grabbing is a slightly different color to the rest.” He then started walking through the herd as his target started wandering off. Now merely drunk rather than very drunk, he was having a little trouble walking across the rock and slick grass ground. His quarry began to able away from him but to no avail as Steve started to jog toward it and tripped gloriously over a rock and landed on his prey which suddenly disappeared along with the whole of the valley.\n\nA new table appeared, covered in various rocks and minerals.  “Identify an evaporite mineral and declare a use.”\nSteve blinked, then started looking at the given samples. He picked one up, then licked it. “Halite. Sodium Chloride. Can be used for preservation or seasoning of foods. You can lick evaporite minerals to more easily identify them. They go well on margarita glass rims.”\n\nThe samples disappeared. A system of pipes appeared, accompanied by a high pitched whistling sound. “Identify, diagnose, repair.”\n\nSteve cringed at the high pitch. “Sounds like a steam leak. Glados, I need a pair of earmuffs so I don’t go deaf, and a one meter stick and a strip of cloth.” The items appeared on the ground in front of him. Steve quickly put on the earmuffs, then tied the strip of cloth to the end of the stick and started working his way through the pipes. After about a minute as he slowly walked around, the bottom half of the cloth strip simply fell away. He looked right, then left, and saw what might have been a pin hole in a six inch pipe about a foot off the ground. He looked away from the hole along the pipe, and found cutoff valves on both sides of the hole. He shut off the near side, which did nothing to abate the noise. “Of course not.” Steve muttered, then very carefully climbed the pipes over the hole to get to the other side, then shutting off that section of pipe. He noticed that it was one pipe out of a series, and the pressure in the other pipes jumped marginally then started rising slowly. “Timed solution. Gotcha. Glados, I need a cutting implement, like a cutting wheel, a twelve inch section of identical pipe, and a welding system.”\n\nNothing happened. “All materials already on hand.”\n\nSteve blinked. “Ok, then.” He stood up, and moved back the way he came. “I remember seeing a storage locker here somewhere. Ah, there it is.” Upon opening it, he saw what looked like a pipe cutter, a stretch of pipe and what appeared to be a hand held wire welder. Gathering what he needed he trotted back to the leak and got to work. \n\nSteve started by examining the leak, then setting up the pipe cutter. “Laser pipe cutters. What will they think of next.”  He cut out a generous section of old pipe, not sure what the mechanism for failure was but wanted to make sure the solution was better than short term.  He held up the section of new pipe, cut it off just a hair short of the exact length, then held it up to the missing section. Steve tacked it in place at the op at both ends, then using the scrap pipe tapped it into line. Happy that the pipes lined up, he finished welding the pipe sealed. After about ten minutes he cracked the downstream valve slowly, letting the pipe repressurize and checked for leaks. Satisfied, he opened the upstream valve slowly, and watched the pressure equalize across the other pipes. He stood watching for a moment then picked up the tools and took them back to their locker. The instant the locker shut the whole system disappeared.\n\nA table appeared in from of him. About twice as long as it was wide, with a white table cloth, a wine bottle, and two glasses. “Fill the glass.” Said Glados.\n\n“I’m more for beer and whiskey but everybody does wine at some point.” Steve picked up the bottle and sniffed it, and he figured it for a red wine, so took the taller glass with the larger globe and filled it to just below where the curve of the glass started back in. He set the bottle down, then paused just before setting the glass down. “Hold on. How did an alien testing facility know to give a human a human glass when no humans have been tested?”\n\n“Google.”\n\nSteve set the glass down, which promptly disappeared. \n\nA rock wall appeared. “Climb, solve.”\nSteve cringed. “I’m not a fan of heights, you know.” He sighed, then started climbing. He paid attention to where his hands and feet went, and slowly made his way up the ten meter wall. He topped out, and discovered another table with a grid of squares. He turned one over then set it down. It automatically set itself face down. He turned a different one, and received the same reaction.  “Ah. Gotcha.” He turned tiles at random till he found a match, then turned them both face up. They both disappeared. He worked his way through until no tiles remained. The table and wall both vanished. \n\nThe process continued for what seemed like ages. Math, physics, chemistry, running, jumping, strength, action, reaction. Food and water were provided when requested. After a while Steve became rather annoyed with the whole process.\n\n“When are we done here, Glados?” Steve asked the nothing.\n\n“Congratulations, you are the first creature in eons to ask the question. Data storage of ancient knowledge has been created and placed in your pod.”\n\n“What.” Steve boggled at the answer.\n\n“Your victory is mutifold. No other race has had an individual with such wide ranging talents.”\n\n“Bullshit.”\n\n“To the contrary. Humans are the first species encountered that teach on a wide range of subjects to all students. Most are given specializations and focuses. Second, of all species tested, you are the first to ask for test ending parameters. Most simply give up, or fail a test, leading to total failure. Minds are wiped then the subject is sent home to preserve the sanctity of the test.”\n\nSteve blinked, then raised his middle finger and walked back to his pod, and went home. “I need several beers.”\n\n(Feel free to give tips and hints on what I can change.

    "body": "Tyler\n\nA solid half hour of hugs, kisses, handshakes, back slaps, well wishes, greetings from new inlaws and long time customers of the shop alike, and the occasional cheek pinch by one of his new auntie in laws for good measure ensued.\n\nFinally the ebbing of the great tide of very happy people sees the Sarkin clan installed in one of the large booths that dominate the corners and walls of the room.\n\nSet up with a two piece table with the centerpiece able to spin to allow people to share dishes easier, and to allow waitresses to gently send food to customers in the corner without any form of issue around a circular table. Miu'Kin's mother, Kamei'Kin, had pulled out all the stops and laid out a veritable feast in front of the new members of her family, clearly eager to celebrate her youngest daughter's success by the preferred method of the Kin clan... food.\n\nDino ribs that would do Fred Flintstone proud, delectable looking steaks of some local critter that were just right in terms of being juicy and lean. Cuts of rich white and red fish fresh off the grill or served raw. Fresh steamed crustaceans and shellfish. Whole game birds of sizes ranging from 'chicken' up to a glossy fried bird with beautiful crispy skin that resembled and tasted like pure dark meat turkey but was around the size of an ostrich.\n\nThat last one was something that Tyler had immediately texted Jerry about as soon as he had his first bite. Not just because it was a good opportunity for his boss and friend's business... but also because he wanted to be able to butter fry one of these monsters and eat it himself whenever he pleased too!\n\nWith all that meat in front of them it was easy to miss the various sides. Mostly small types of rough vegetables, the turtle rice or a few other little things that packed a serious punch flavor wise by Galactic standards, or served as a form of cleanser, like ginger almost. All served with ample Apuk style sauces ranging from something not too far off from BBQ sauce to more of the berry jam that had been in the pastry they'd enjoyed earlier at Caring Conquests. The main flavoring on offer was of course one of the Apuk's favorite animal based foodstuffs... butter.\n\nApuk used enough butter to make Paula Dean an honorary noble, if not a saint in one of the Apuk's native religions. They cooked in it, put it on food in various formats ranging from butter based sauces to slightly less complicated offerings. For example, lightly herbed butter was a favorite for many Apuk to put on meat. The herb and butter mixture was considered strong stuff by the Apuk and was just flavorful enough that a human could enjoy it without needing to supplement any further flavor... except maybe a pinch of salt like most galactic cuisine.\n\nCassie, normally so prim and proper was apparently hungry enough that she'd gone slightly feral, and was forcing herself to not automatically hood her wings over her food like a great bird of prey as she tore at one of the dinosaur ribs, proclaiming it to be absolutely delicious before cracking the bone and eating the marrow and moving on to the next rib in the rack.\n\nFor Tyler's part while the sheer volume of meat was awe inspiring, he felt himself craving a decent amount of vegetables, or at least a bowl of plain white rice to cut all the richness with as the meal went on. In fact the more he thought about that, the more appealing layering some of this mountain of carnivorous delights onto a bowl of freshly steamed white rice became.\n\nThe sheer mix of delectable flavors that would soak into the rice as he worked his way through the meat alone seemed designed to tantalize his taste buds. Thankfully the Apuk grain the troops on the Tear generally called Turtle rice was a somewhat close enough substitute. It got the job done any way, even if it lacked the delicate flavor of true white rice.\n\nMiu'Kin, for her part, was having a grand time despite her initial familial misgivings. She was seated to Tyler's right, teaching her new husband about Apuk family style cuisine both for her family specifically and for the capital region.\n\nThere were commonalities compared to Nara's home province, and as the capital you could generally get anything from anywhere on the planet if you wanted it, but the Kin mainstay was Northern cuisine which tended towards more intense flavors.\n\nThe North also had a unique dish in a strong broth that was served cool, and either drunk as a beverage or a very strong tea, or eaten with noodles in a style that strongly reminded Tyler of soba. It was considered essential for cooling off when you were out working near an active volcano in the specific parts of the North the Kins hailed from.\n\nThere was of course hot noodle dishes too, Apuk spicy noodles was a dish that had eagerly been adopted by humans aboard the Tear after Jerry had learned about them on a date with Masha, though Nara pointed out that the way it was served on the Tear was distinctly non-traditional to a horrified Kamei'Kin.\n\n\"Well that just won't do at all! I'll be sure to send a cookbook along with you when you head back up to orbit. I know you humans can take a lot but there's no reason to not get it right. Besides, if I manage to open up a dialogue with this Chief Noitaka of yours, I bet I can get some tips on doing things in a more human style. This dashi stock you talked about sounds very similar to some concepts in Apuk cuisine already and I just bet I could replicate it... without the massive amount of sodium chloride and other poisons you seem to ingest. An Apuk grade human hot sauce also seems like it has a lot of potential too! Oh this will be all sorts of fun! Especially if I can actually get my hands on some human style meat.\"\n\nTyler nods, smiling at his newest mother in law. \"I don't see why not ma'am-\"\n\nKamei'Kin holds up a hand. \"Hold it right there. I love that you're so polite, sweet ember but really I can't have my son in law, or any of my daughters in law calling me ma'am! You just call me Kamei'Kin or \"Momma\" like my little flame over here.\"\n\nMiu'Kin wilts slightly, clearly wishing her species still had a shell so she could hide in it for a moment, only to brighten up a touch when Tyler gives her thigh a reassuring squeeze under the table. He could appreciate how it could feel having a parent who was such a... bombastic personality to say the least.\n\nKamei'Kin settles back in the booth a bit. \"So, let's get down to the brass tacks I suppose, how long till you leave? I always figured Miu would leave Serbow at some point but goddess's shell it does seem like it's come up faster than I'd expected.\"\n\nTyler shrugs. \"Well we don't rightly know, we were making port call for at least two weeks, and we're a literal day into the first week practically speaking, but now the Skipper's marrying an Imperial Princess so gods only know how long that's gonna take to shake out completely. There's some sort of business the Skipper needs to attend to in Nodawk city in the Tier barony too, so that'll eat some time up, I mean the list goes on. I'm sure the Captain and the diplomats will find plenty for us to do to make the stop over worth the time. Can't just have everyone on liberty the whole time after all. Though from what we just saw at Caring Conquests one of the major activities will be moving the personal effects of new Apuk spouses up to the Crimson Tear from Serbow.\"\n\nKamei'Kin slaps her knee and lets out a bark of laughter. \"Don't I believe it too! Hah! Goodness it's been awhile since we found a species that had menfolk who were downright eager for Apuk brides. Normally ladies like us and the Cannidor can have a hard time reeling in mates from the more delicate species. Dating only Apex species limits the dating pool quite a bit, to the point that you may as well marry into your own species. Apuk in general tend to stick to our own space and prefer our own culture... similar again to the Cannidor. So we end up marrying within our own species more often than not.\"\n\nTyler nods. \"Then along comes my species, and the biggest debate in the barracks among our Marines and sailors is if Apuk or Cannidor make for the best possible bride for a human. With strong camps arguing for the Horchka and Seramali, but that's a demographic bias as much as anything. We have a lot of men happily married to Seramali and Horchka gals, myself included. Undaunted wide, the Apuk and Cannidor have very strong fan clubs among humans.\"\n\n\"Considering you've got two Apuk brides, two Seramali and this beauty of a Rabbis to my left I think I can guess where you fall in that debate.\"\n\n\"Heh. Guilty as charged. Cannidor can be a bit... much for me. I enjoyed meeting the Crimsonhewers at our last port call, and I've met some of their girls who have shipped aboard the Tear now, but honestly, even married and allegedly a bit calmer they're just... a lot. Apuk have big personalities but tend to compensate by being proper ladies too. That said I've met a lot of wonderful alien women from all sorts of species now and while I understand the debate as just something stupid to kill time, I don't think there's a definitive species that produces the best wives for humanity as a whole. It's a silly concept inherently. I'm sure there's a guy out there who's got a perfect match in just about any species. Hell one of my buddies has built himself a family of primarily Arachne women... and frankly, while his wives are lovely for the most part, they creep me the fuck out to the point that I have trouble being in the same room as them. I've never been a big fan of spiders.\"\n\nThe Apuk matriarch considers that for a moment and nods. \"Hmmm, fair enough, there's always going to be one species or another that someone just can't process or understand for whatever reason. I don't understand the Slohb at all. Or the type of man who'd seek out a Vulba or Charbis hive as his family. Or other cultures with what we might consider more extreme lifestyles... and I know the Apuk's lifestyle, especially here on Serbow where things are still a bit more... traditional, than the colonies, you could say, is considered extreme in it's own way.”\n\n\"Kidnapping as a method of courtship can certainly leave that impression on people.\" Cassie notes primly, gently dabbing her mouth with a linen napkin to clean off any errant sauce or meat.\n\n\"Oh psh.\" Kamei'Kin waves Cassie off a bit with a laugh. \"It's not that common!\" She stops and considers for a second. \"Well.

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!! \n\n[FIND A PIERCER HERE ](https://safepiercing.org/) \n\n[HOW TO FIND GOOD NON APP PIERCERS](https://www.lynnloheide.com/post/portfolios-how-to-find-a-good-piercer) \n\nand even if you did you do not have an autoclave to sterilize jewelry and tools/equipment. If you didn’t get your piercing done by a professional piercer in a studio (not people who call themselves piercers and will pierce anyone naive to pay them. They do not count) ‼️‼️‼️LITERALLY TAKE IT OUT‼️‼️‼️ if it’s not infected and you’re having problems with it DONT EVEN BOTHER just remove it let it heal while continuing to rinse with saline and then get it repierced professionally. \n\nLet’s start! You probably don’t have an infection!!!!!!! An infection is a very hot ear/nose/skin etc with white yellow or green pus you may run a fever or develop a pimple looking pustule. To clear an infection you can only use two things: your immune system and antibiotics. Anything else is ineffective.  \n‼️‼️YOU MUST SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU SUSPECT INFECTION‼️‼️‼️\n\nNow what’s an irritation bump? An irritation bump is a little hard discoloured bump that develops around the sight of the piercing it happens for these few common reasons\n\n🌟🌟READ THIS CAREFULLY ALMOST ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES ARE LISTED HERE IF YOU STILL CANNOT RESOLVE THE ISSUES CONSIDER REMOVING THE PIERCING🌟🌟\n\n1.) you’re allergic to the jewelry!! Always pierce with implant grade titanium\n\n2. You have BAD jewelry always pierce with internally threaded titanium NEVER EXTERNAL\n\n    2a almost every piercing is pierced with a flat back labret jewelry (a stud that screws on) it’s a straight barbell NOT RINGS This is fantastic!\nOne note for 2a - some cartilage barbell piercings should have a ball or M&M shaped backing, not a flat labret-style back. The latter tends to collect more crusties/cause irritation.\n\n    2b here are some locations where they use a curved bar: rook, anti tragus’ navel  eyebrow. Daiths and septum’s can start with a ring. Septum’s can also start with circular barbells/ horseshoes \n\n    2c. For navels make sure your tummy rolls do not collapse on your belly button if you do you must get a floating navel or you WILL get a bump from your ring constantly being squished and pushed upwards \n\n    2d. bar length!! The bar was too short to accommodate swelling ORRR you didn’t downsize after the swelling went down and the bar began to catch on things \n\n3.) you were pierced at a bad angle sometimes bad angles have trouble healing because they go through more skin and or they’re in a position where it’s constantly catching in things THIS IS A VERY COMMON CAUSE FOR PIERCING BUMPS SO PLEASE SEE APP OR REPUTABLE PIERCERS \n\n    3A) you should almost always be pierced perpendicular to your anatomy it should be at a 90 degree angle!!!! \n\n    3b) pierced on the surface they eventually reject anyways \n\n    3c) ‼️‼️NEVER LET ANYONE PIERCE YOU WITH A GUN‼️‼️‼️ guns can shatter cartilage and harbour bacteria. Piercers should autoclave your jewelry and the needle should come in a sterile pack google what an autoclave is and look for it  \n\n4) you slept on it (get a travel pillow ofc)\n\n5)  your hair got caught in it (headbands are great solutions)\n\n6) incorrect cleaning!!! Rinse with sterile saline or wound wash it should have no additives!! Pat dry with non woven gauze but personally the shitty brown paper towels work just fine You do not need to soak it and do not use your own salt water but saline !!!\n\n7) you were messing with it. Piercings heal by forming a fistula around the ring. This is scar tissue you need to leave it still so it can form this scar tissue if you twist it or push it around your essentially ripping your fistula apart\n\n    7a) don’t take out piercings while healing other than to downsize the bar. it will irritate the wound and it can just close if you take it out for a while \n\nLet’s move on to the rest :)\n\nWhen you’re healing a wound you want to keep it dry as in you don’t wanna submerge it in water!!!!! or leave it moist long enough for bacteria to fester and grow. however you want to maintain your skins natural moisture levels. When you use alcohol it evaporates water in your skin and dries it out too much when it’s this dries your skin cells die out and it doesn’t heal as well.  Alcohol is great for cleaning unbroken skin or maybe even a minor scrape and cuts and abrasions (anything on the first layer of skin is fine) but not for piercing wounds they’re very deep and you pierce through your actual flesh. Your flesh is very fragile to harsh chemicals like alcohol\n\nNow like I said earlier you want to maintain your skins natural moisture so no creams or oils!!!! In fact creams and oils are often nutrient rich and WET and will attract more bacteria. they’ll also trap dirt and the skin cells your skin is attempting to shed. Never put them directly on piercings. Now neosporin is a papular cream for minor cuts and abrasions but you don’t need it it’s just a mini antibiotic your body heals fine on it’s own and honestly sometimes Vaseline does the damn job for burns and stuff.\n\nOnto keloids!!! Rule of thumb If you think you have a keloid you probably don’t. A keloid is genetic scarring disorder you are born with it and you usually know since someone in your family might OR you’re a person of colour darker skinned people like black people tend to have keloids genetically. And they NEVER go away without clinical treatment sometimes they grow forever.  They tend to have their own blood supply and be a bit squishy. If you’ve had an irritation bump for longer than a year  or have a history or family history of keloids or anything I mention in this section. you should consider it’s not an irritation bump. If you’ve tried everything above and you were pierced perfectly maybe it is a keloid!! if you did have a keloid you would be receiving rounds of corticosteroids under clinical supervision depending on your case. Some doctors will cut it off freeze it off or laser it off but I guarantee your store bought cream did not do the job.\n\nSaline rinses great point there let’s look into it!! Saline isn’t really SUPPOSED to do anything that’s like the whole point if you know what I mean. Saline is great because your human body has the same salt concentration as saline so again you are maintaining your natural body’s composition. It’s called homeostasis if you wanna learn more!! What it does is just give your piercing a good rinse and bring it back to the usual. And what’s cool is salt is antimicrobial too!!! But the perfect amount of salt just for you eh! and let me also mention some people get “saline solutions” that have other stuff in them you don’t want any additives it should only have sodium chloride (chemical name for salt) and water!! So who knows\n    \n       ‼️‼️‼️That means no tea tree oil no alcohol no hydrogen peroxide nothing!!!! just saline only‼️‼️‼️\n\n🖤🖤Don’t be afraid to ask your piercer about the standards for oral genital and nipple piercings they may require fitting different kinds of jewelry and/or after care that are different than this general post. but theres tons of more information on these websites: https://www.lynnloheide.com/blog and https://www.safepiercing.org/safe_piercing_faq.php and https://pierced.co/blogs/all \n\nHere’s a food for thought if you’ve ever had your wisdom teeth out a surgery or anything like that think what would you do and what would your doctor say about it\n\nThanks for reading !!! ...",

I use it as recommended by my piercer, but sometimes it ends up leaving some threads (idk how ;;) but it's the only thing I can clean it with... As for paper i'm too afraid it contains bacteria since paper isn't usually in a closed environment so I'm always afraid it has bacteria... What should I do?\n\n2- you talked about not leaving your piercing wet but I have a nostril so it's kinda inevitable that it's humid... Is this bad? It's really hard to keep it dry all the time since it's in a humid spot. \n\n3- still about cleaning. (Sorry for the tmi in advance) I get snot stuck to my piercing a LOT. The snot is usually dry, even after showering. Now, I know I shouldn't force anything but I don't feel safe leaving snot there (since it can attract bacteria or not allow the hole to breathe) but it requires some effort and nostril-bending to get to the snot. Should I leave it or force it a little to stay clean even tho it's probably the cause of my bubble?\n\n4- About the ammount of times I should clean my piercing. Everyone says once to twice a day. Does it depend on your routine? Like, if you go out it's better to clean it twice but if you stay home once is enough?\n\nExcellent post btw!! Thank you so much for all the info and sorry for having so many questions!",

I've been trying to get in potassium and magnesium, but had been neglecting the sodium. Herp derp. \n\nSo I read around on here a bit (yes, some people do search the sub before posting a question) and saw a suggestion to take in sodium and potassium. Which I guess makes sense, because the body seems to leech potassium to replace sodium if there isn't enough sodium.\n\nAt any rate, I went and mixed 1/4tsp each No-Salt (potassium chloride) and regular salt (sodium chloride) into 2 cups of chicken broth, warmed it up, and drank it. And the headache went away within like 3 minutes, before I had even finished the broth. The hell? Most surprising thing I've ever encountered, and that's saying something.\n\n**TL;DR: I mixed potassium and sodium salt into broth to cure a headache and leg ache problem and it worked within 3 minutes.

Electrolyte imbalance isn't keto specific and is very manageable.  When I think of the keto flu, it is the symptoms you get when your body is in the process of establishing metabolic flexibility, adapting to ketosis and becoming efficient enough at it that the body can meet energy demands.  It is brain fog, fatigue caused by the brain and muscle tissues learning to burn ketone bodies rather than glucose and isn't avoidable.  Electrolyte imbalance is, and I don't think it should be regarded as the \"keto flu\" because it makes it sound like something we all must go through, and we don't.\n\nPhew.

However, emerging data suggest that mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium levels at 131–135 mmol/L) is associated with numerous complications or subtle, presently unrecognized symptoms[11] (for example, increased falls, altered posture and gait, reduced attention).[12]\n>\n>Neurological symptoms typically occur with very low levels of plasma sodium (usually <115 mmol/L).[10] When sodium levels in the blood become very low, water enters the brain cells and causes them to swell. This results in increased pressure in the skull and causes hyponatremic encephalopathy. As pressure increases in the skull, herniation of the brain can occur, which is a squeezing of the brain across the internal structures of the skull. This can lead to headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, brain stem compression and respiratory arrest, and non-cardiogenic accumulation of fluid in the lungs.[13] This is usually fatal if not immediately treated.\n\nfrom wikipedia.",

    "body": "Hi, I'm new here (25M), so please go easy on me.\n\nFor context, my mom (50+F) has undiagnosed schizophrenia since I was in O levels. Main symptoms are blocking all her friends, thinking that everyone (even bystanders) are out there to get her, disorganised and contradictory thoughts (becoming a Christian only to renounce it right after), outlandish behaviours such as putting bleach on tile gaps to \"clean\" it only to erode the tiles, trying to evict me and her out of the HDB thinking there's structural problems. I say undiagnosed because when she was performing normal in front of doctors at the polyclinic, but instantly said that the doctors is \"part of the conspiracy to get her\" right after the doors closed behind her. She then moved to Hong Kong to stay with the other half of the family with the pretense that Singapore is unsafe. She left a 3-room HDB under her name, and I stayed there for 5 years, paying for the mortgage that's under her name. It was okay, I replaced some old furnitures and repurposed it into my own personal space.\n\nRecently she has came back unannounced, and no one really knows the reason why, her reasoning was vague (\"I just felt threatened\"). Here are the highlights:\n\n ⁃ In a span of 3 days, her train of thought was “I want to live here”, “I want to sell the house”, “It’s okay, I can let the mortgage lapse”, “I’m okay moving out, can be anywhere in Singapore”, “I’m okay moving out, but it has to be close to you”, “No I will never move out, why should I leave my own house”, “Let’s find a lawyer and change the mortgage/HDB ownership to my name, then we can talk about what jobs should I be looking for”(she's unemployed.)\n\n ⁃ I have set up a camera to monitor her daily behaviour, and I've noticed that she doesn’t shower or change her clothes. When confronted, she said she wipe her body with the contents of a plastic bottle she brought along that was in the freezer, which is a mix of bleach, “sodium chloride”, and water. Her hair is washed by the same contents of the bottle, only with “moisturising” nail polish remover. When asked where did she learn that from, she said “God told her so.” Which God, since she’s agnostic? \"Any.\" In unrelated news, she’s playing Muslim prayers this morning.\n\n ⁃ The whole house is dark most of the time. She refuses to turn on lights, unless watching TV at night. Besides her mumbling to herself, which consists of conspiracy theories of how everyone is (again) lying to her, we have no idea what is going on in her mind most of the time.\n\nWith that being said, what should my options be?  \nShould I pull a fast one and send her to IMH to get a diagnosis of her shizophrenia so she can stay in IMH?  \nShould I get a lawyer to change the mortgage under my name so I can still retain control of the HDB?  \nShould I figure out a way to send her to an old folks home, since she's CPF eligible age already?  \nShould I just move out and cut off contact with her completely?\n\nThanks in advance, reddit. I'm very desperate.\n\nEdit: hey redditors, it's been 24h and im a little overwhelmed by the responses this has. i read every single reply, and im incredibily thankful for most of the replies that are understanding and considerate, very useful advices that didn't even cross my mind, and some of you sharing your own personal experiences. after some considerations, talking to professionals, and some research, i decided to proceed with going for the private ambulance to IMH this week, even if it means i have to take a small loan to do so. let me know if you want an update on this.",

The 995 ambulance are for emergency situations and the private ones have their own criteria for accepting patients (and very expensive). If she turns violent you may call the police for assistance and they can bring her to IMH depending on their evaluation. \n\nWhen brought to IMH, they will usually assess her physical and mental state. Physical well being will be given priority thus some patients may be sent to other hospitals first. As for mental health evaluation, the A&E at IMH will triage and your input would be vital. It would be good to record down her behaviour on paper if you are able to as well.\n\nHowever, IMH cannot hold anyone against their consent unless they fit certain criteria at point of entry and it is not long term. You may approach their medical social worker or case managers to discuss a caregiver plan. At 25 and alone, it will be very hard to do this so please consider carefully if you are able to be a sole caregiver. \n\nSchizophrenia is a chronic incurable illness and for many patients, it is lifelong journey of acceptance and willing to be helped, trying out different mix of medications, therapy and having support from caregivers. Some patients have been able to live better or even well so don't lose hope.\n\nThe first step is still for your mum to be seen by a psychiatrist.\n\nI'm more familiar with how this works than the part about house ownership but I do believe you can ask advise from the msw as well about this and other financial advise in regards to being a caregiver.\n\nRemember to reach out for support and don't weather this alone.\n\nSource: used to work in mental healthcare",

The people telling you to dump her off at the psych ward are not only heartless, it validates people's paranoia if you're going to let them rot away and take away their humanity. You have to advocate to your mom that you love her and you want to protect her. She will have days where she is good and coherent and she will have days she's in a complete haze. You gotta convince her to seek treatment and just be available to talk. People are acting like she is bedridden and you u have to wipe her ass.... all you have to do is talk to her to help her. One thing to remember is you cannot have a rational argument with an irrational person. When she starts to get into spirals you cannot engage in the argument or delusions. You have to step outside the situation and be the adult. With mental support (talking) schizophrenia becomes very manageable. My mom holds down her own job and pays the mortgage on her house. Owns her car. Etc. She learned her triggers and hasn't had an episode for 6 years. \n\nBut when people get left to rot in a psych ward they do not get better. It fuels their delusions and you will lose their trust forever when they start to spiral. If they need to be admitted, sometimes it's needed to begin treatment. You have to visit them daily if you want it to really work. Good luck to your situation it is very difficult\n\n\nEdit\": to protect both you and your mom get the HDB transfered to your name",

But for your case it is hindering your own life too badly imo and there are very little options in sg for mental health for elderly.\n\n\nEdit: I'd like to say that the doctors in Imh aren't bad. It's just mainly their inpatient care. Their inpatient care ironically is much worse than their outpatient.\nOutpatient somehow get higher priority for some treatments in Imh due to scheduling.\nIve seen a inpatient waiting 2 weeks for a treatment while an outpatient gets 3 treatments within 1 week.",

I wonder how many people are getting ripped off by this scam?\n\nYep, everyone is trying to stop rising health care costs. /sarc\n\nEdit: My cost was $54.00 after my insurance company paid $14.00 of it. Since the doctor was part of the insurance network of providers, I called them and complained. They told me that they were investigating it. When I went the next day to return the kit, the pharmacist was all grouchy, and told me that I couldn't possibly duplicate it with OTC medicine. I explained to him how I procured the *exact* same ingredients, he told me that not everyone can do that. So much for your helpful, caring, friendly pharmacist that is just looking out for your well-being. \n\n**update:**\n\nJust had the procedure and it was a breeze. The staff at the clinic were *very* interested in how I put my own kit together, and asked me to email them the details. So I think I can let the doctor off the hook, but not the drug company or the pharmacist.\n\n**edit**\n\nThe staff at the clinic asked for my \"recipe.\" Here's what I sent them:\n\nHalflitely contains:\n\n210g polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350)\n\n1 bisacodyl tablet 5mg\n\n2.86g sodium bicabonate\n\n5.6g sodium chloride\n\n.74g potassium chloride\n\nartificially sweetened flavor packet\n\n\nMy preparation: ( I converted the grams to teaspoons, since most people do not have chemistry scales.)\n\n1 bottle (238g) PEG 3350. This can be found under various brand names, and Walmart, Kroger, etc. should have house brands. (I bought Walgreens brand Smooth Lax.) \n\n\n1-5mg enteric coated Bisacodyl tablet I bought Walgreens Gentle Laxative Tablets, but I had to buy 25 of them. Bisacodyl can also be found as Ducolax, Carter's little pills, etc.\n\nElectrolytes:\n\n1/4 tsp (1.5 g) Morton Lite Salt (contains 50% sodium chloride and 50% potassium chloride, (this provides .75g of KCl).)\n\n1/2 tsp (slightly rounded) (3g) sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)\n\n1tsp (5g) salt.\n\n(This closely approximates the electrolytes found in Halflytely. precision is not at all critical here)\n\nPlace PEG 3350 and electrolytes in 2 liter soda bottle. fill halfway and shake well, then finish filling bottle and shake again.\n\nUse the same instructions as with Halflytely.\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope you can use this!\n\nYour staff at the clinic is great, BTW.\n\nTake care,\n\nTravesura\n\n**Edit:**\nDamn, I was asleep, (10:18 PM MST) and a little anal *squirt* woke me up. But at least I got to read my new messages. Great discussion, and I appreciate all of your input on this subject.\n\nOne nice thing about my procedure was that afterward they smiled and congratulated me every time I ripped a huge fart. It seems that copious farting is a really good sign when you are in recovery. I have never experienced such enthusiastic approval for flatulence before!\n\nThey sent me home with three photos: 1. A picture of a diverticulum, 2. The opening to my appendix, 3. A nice brown-eye shot of my rectum. Do you have a close up picture of your rectum? I didn't think so. \n\n**edit.**\n\nThe lead nurse at the GI clinic just sent me this: **Thank you for passing this along.  We have several patients that just can not afford the halflytley prep.  Until Medicare begins to pick up the tab, we may be able to help with this.  Hope all is well and back to normal for you**\n\nI am very gratified that my frugal endeavor will now be helping others!\n",

Depending on the drug and  your insurance, this may only mean a few bucks extra out of your pocket that you probably won't even notice, but more profit to Target.\n \nBut not always.\n\n **never EVER fucking go to Target pharmacy.**",

    "created": "2018-01-06T16:08:24+00:00",
    "body": "As no shortage of terrible adaptations will show, adapting a property from one medium to the next is hard. Even within the same medium, adapting across platforms is deceptively difficult. An adaptation must maintain the ‘spirit’ of the original, but also note the limitations of the new medium and consider how people consume it. \n\nAnd now, after almost a year of Fire Emblem Heroes’s release, I’d like to break down and discuss the methods that *Heroes* employs to replicate the feel of mainline Fire Emblem. Because I feel like it’s very easy to discuss this talking point with “because it has the same mechanics, duh,” I’m going to raising comparisons to another mobile game, *Phantom of the Kill*. \n\nFor those who aren’t aware, *Phantom of the Kill*, hereby to be referred to as just *Phantom* or PotK for short, is a strategy RPG developed by Gumi with gatcha elements. Phantom incorporates a weapon triangle of swords, axes, lances wherein swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. Mages and archers attack at range, while Staves primarily heal. Combat is built around a system of colored affinities that grant and reduce damage in a glorified rock-paper-scissors system. Combat takes place on a grid, tapping on a player unit displays their movement range in blue squares and their attack range in red…\n\nYou’ve played this game. Or, since you’re hanging around on this subreddit, you’ve played this game, but better, which makes Phantom an excellent counterpoint to anything and everything that Heroes gets right. \n\nI’d like to make clear now: I’m not going to offer Phantom a lot of compliments. Everything that it does wrong is enough material for another essay: nonsensical plot, poor character writing, overdesigned and forgettable character designs, unresponsive and janky controls, awful level design… the list goes on. However, for the purposes of this essay, I will be pointing my criticisms of Phantom as issues that Heroes rectifies. \n\nI’d also like to make clear: If you like Phantom of the Kill, that’s fine. I don’t hate you. You can like what you like. Also, most of my arguments about Phantom aren’t necessarily to assert that it’s a bad game (though I believe it to be one) but rather that it doesn’t do a good job of replicating the spirit of Fire Emblem. I have no idea if the developers intended it to do so, but since it copies Fire Emblem’s mechanics nearly wholesale, but is devoid of Fire Emblem’s spirit, it makes a great counterpoint nonetheless.\n\nSo then, if the method by which Heroes replicates the feel of Fire Emblem lies not in it’s core mechanics (though, make no mistake, this is but the barest of bones), it must lie elsewhere. Instead, Fire Emblem Heroes replicates the spirit and feel of Fire Emblem by taking it’s core game mechanics and, rather than directly translating those mechanics, takes their effects on the player and seeks to replicate those. The mechanics in question are some of the ones that define Fire Emblem. Of course, some of the ones in this list were mitigated or removed by certain installments, but are generally prevalent throughout the series, and contribute to the series reputation as very hard games. The mechanics in question are: permanent death, breakable weapons, the limited resources, and it’s map design. \n\n#Permadeath\n\nReal quick, if you haven’t played a Fire Emblem game before, one of the things that sets it apart as a strategy game is that units who die in the game are killed, and cannot be used for the rest of the campaign. It’s similar to a Nuzlocke run in Pokemon. People die when they are killed. \n\nSo, obviously, you can’t replicate that in a mobile gatcha game. That’s practically *begging* for your game to fail. No one’s going to spend real money on a unit that they could potentially lose forever with a single misclick. Come on. Of course not. It seems that Intelligent Systems recognized this, as well. So, instead of replicating the act of permadeath, IS instead replicates how permadeath forces players to think about and experience Fire Emblem. \n\nPermadeath forces players to be exceedingly careful, and the series is incredibly unforgiving with mistakes. You’ll get no sympathy from the series if you misclick. You’ll get no sympathy if you didn’t notice that that archer with a Longbow was creeping up on your favorite pegasus knight waifu. The game has no sympathy if you didn’t check that Priest’s item list and he actually had a Warp staff hiding behind that Heal staff, and now all the Armors you *were* afraid of are styling all over your army. \n\nBecause Fire Emblem has no sympathy, the series conditions the player to *be careful*. Character deaths are always a huge blow to the army, given the investment that must’ve gone into that character(but we’ll get to that). Even if the player resets (as most players tend to do), it’s still valuable time wasted, and potential good level-ups that have been reset and cast again at the mercy of the RNG. And it’s just… kind of a frustrating feeling all around.\n\nFire Emblem Heroes uses different methods to come to the same conclusion: it conditions players to be careful by also being extremely punishing with it’s mistakes. Mistakes cost players valuable stamina, resources, and mental health, just as they did in mainline Fire Emblem.\n\nBefore the Stamina Cap was increased to 99 (Hey, remember when it was 50? Pepperidge Farm remembers) and before the maximum stamina on story missions was lowered to 10, story stamina costs could reach as high as 25. This meant that, (at launch, at least) players were given two tries on any given level before they were either forced to wait, or expend stamina potions. For players who didn’t want to take either option, the remaining choice was to be careful and plan moves accordingly. These restrictions were made tighter during specific quests, usually the ‘use a specific unit, keep everyone alive’ ones. Even the loss of a single unit meant that an entire mission run would have to be reset, that one of two tries had been expended.\n\nIt’s like this in the Arena as well. I think I hardly have to explain. Remember when you forgot to check that someone had Wings of Mercy during the last battle of your perfect Arena run? Remember when you miscounted dancer ranges and got Reinhardt’d/Bowlyn’d to death? I feel as though anyone who’s played Heroes to any degree of seriousness only needs to be reminded of this to understand *that feeling.*\n\nBut the effect of this is that players need to be incredibly careful to avoid this frustration, the same care and the same frustration that mainline Fire Emblem induces in it’s players.\n\nI get that this is kind of an obvious thing to make a note of, but I think it’s rather revealing of the developer’s mindset when crafting Heroes to feel like a Fire Emblem game. The developers aren’t thinking of a one-to-one adaptation of Fire Emblem. Rather, like any good adaptation, the developers are thinking of the series’s core features and the effect that those features have on the player’s experience, and attempting to replicate the experience.\n\nAfter all, I think the feeling of losing your favorite unit and having to reset a map is pretty darn similar to the feeling of getting Bowlyn’d and having to reset your arena run, just on a comparatively bite-sized scale.\n\nBy contrast, *Phantom*’s ‘penalty’ for letting characters fall in battle is that their weapon has a chance of breaking. Broken gear must be repaired in the weapon forge, which requires money (the rough equivalent to Hero Feathers, but we’ll get to that) or Rare Prisms, which are obtained by sending home units of three stars or rarer. When using money to fix weapons, there’s a chance that the process will fail. Players are given the option to use more money to increase the rate of success, but cannot go higher than 90%. Using 10 Rare Prisms, however, always yields a 100% success rate. If the process of fixing the gear fails, that gear has a chance of being lost forever. \n\nHowever, this system doesn’t do a very good job at conditioning the player to avoid failure the way Fire Emblem does, because of the way resources and cost are handled. Come midgame, it’s pretty apparent that the developers intended the monetary cost of fixing weapons to encourage players to keep their units alive. However, the design of Phantom breaks this in several ways. For starters, a broken weapon disables the weapon, but not the actual unit. There’s nothing stopping players from just equipping a different weapon, and once the players reach the point where fixing gear becomes a hassle, they’ve also reached the point where they’re swimming in strong weapons anyways. Furthermore, by this point, the player has almost certainly rolled enough random 3 star units that they’re similarly swimming in Rare Prisms. Here’s the kicker: while the money cost scales with the weapon’s rarity, the cost to use Rare Prisms never does, remaining at 10 no matter what weapon it is. This means that, unless the player is *constantly* losing all but one of their units in every battle, and the RNG is *constantly* screwing them over and breaking all five of those weapons, dropping a character in battle hardly even qualifies as a slap on the wrist; all you need to do is send home a 3 star that you weren’t going to do anyways or equip a different weapon and you’re fine. The prospect of losing a unit means nothing at all, which serves to turn Phantom away from replicating the experience of Fire Emblem.\n\nThe end result is that Phantom conditions it’s players to think nothing of losing a unit, while Heroes ensures that character death feels very similar to character death in the main series. Despite similar mechanics between these mobile games, it’s the details of how the game conditions it’s players that sets them apart.\n\n#Breakable Weapons\n\nThis principle can be applied to the series’s system of breakable weapons as well. (Of course, Gaiden and Fates did away with Breakable weapons, but a majority of series uses it, so that’s what I’ll be going off of.)\n\nThe crux of the breakable weapons is that, as a player ascends, the weapons go up in power but also decrease in uses. So, when a player starts the game with all Bronze/Iron weapons, which tend to have 40-50 uses, the player won’t be as punished for failing to keep track of everyone’s weapons. A single Iron Sword can see use through like, three earlygame maps. But as the game progresses, and the Iron Sword won’t cut it anymore, the player is forced to keep a closer eye on everyone’s weapons. Steel Swords, for example, tend to have 30~40 uses, as opposed to Iron Sword’s 40~50. Come endgame, a lot of the legendary weapons have around 20 uses, which means they’ll be able to take out… maybe 12 units, tops before they break. At its most extreme, *Path of Radiance*’s Silver Blades clock in just shy of the Ragnell’s might… but also have no less than *fifteen* uses. \n\nThus, the system of weapons creates a natural progression: The player begins the game with a system in place that they can overlook without being punished, but slowly, as they progress further into the game, keeping one eye on that system is absolutely necessary, lest you grab Mercurius, one of the Three Regalia, devastatingly powerful… only for it to snap in thirds halfway through the last map and Lon’qu running around trying to crit people with a tree branch. \n\nIn Heroes, the system of breakable weapons is incompatible with the Skills system. So, instead of replicating breakable weapons, the developers instead used the Skills system to replicate the feel and progression of the weapons.\n\nThe skills system is set up such that, in the early game, the player isn’t strictly punished for failing to check enemies skill lists, but failure to do so in the lategame will result in Wings of No Mercy losses and copious amounts of sodium chloride. For example, when first competing in the arena with a team of level 15 units, it doesn’t really matter that you failed to notice that the enemy Laslow had Axebreaker 1. You probably hit him with Sharena and he went down. It doesn’t really matter if you failed to notice that that Azura had Wings of Mercy 1, since being below 30% HP is a pretty specific set of conditions, especially for an earlygame player. \n\nBut as Heroes players progressed in builds and power, ignoring skills was no longer an option. You will get killed (or at least, put in a bad spot) if you attack into a neutral lance-lance matchup without realizing that the enemy is rocking Lancebreaker. You will lose your perfect run if you think you can bait someone and then kill them on player phase, if you fail to notice that someone else has Wings of Mercy or Escape Route. It’s not the slightest bit surprising to me that Vantage amassed the infamy that it did, (even if I don’t consider it particularly good) because it’s the exact kind of skill that would get the drop on a player who isn’t used to keeping a close eye on skills yet. And, when SI came out and it showed up on everyone and their mother, you bet some of those players weren’t used to juggling attention between everyone’s skill lists.\n\nThis is without even really mentioning the utter chaos of giving everyone Legendary and Silver weapons, having to neurotically tap and make sure nothing’s about to break. This might be exclusive to me, but I found the experience of neurotically tapping on enemies and scanning for Wings of Mercy at the start of every player phase to be oddly familiar. But that might just be the PTSD speaking.\n\nPhantom of the Kill has no such system. There simply isn’t a counterpart I think I can turn to. There’s nothing *in* Phantom that can be easily ignored that the game that slowly becomes more and more integrated with the combat, to the point where, come endgame, ignoring it would be a serious detriment.\n\nI could look at Phantom’s own skill system, but, Phantom’s skill system is so inflexible and has so little impact on the game that I honestly ignored it for nearly my time playing it and suffered no consequence, even after I cleared most of the endgame content. Phantom’s combat system is an RPG at its simplest and most barebones: only the stats matter. And, because Phantom’s level cap goes as high as 80, and can have units that reach over a hundred points in each stat, it really doesn’t matter if your skill gives you an extra 50% dodge rate against swords: the crushing weight of stats means that skill will be deducting 50% from a base 186% hit rate.\n\nBecause nothing in Phantom provides the same effect, I’m basically out of a job. I’ll just say that, because it fails to replicate this particular aspect and makes no real attempt at doing so, it fails to replicate this particular feel of Fire Emblem and just move on. \n\n#Investment Costs\n\n\nOf course, Fire Emblem isn’t unique for having investment choices. More or less every game limits the player in some way, shape or form and prevents the player from investing in every single character. Sometimes, that limitation is just your own patience. Persona 3, for example, makes it clear from the get-go that you’ll never get to use more than four party members at once, so training more outside that number is only really limited by that knowledge. Fire Emblem takes a different approach: Experience (generally) cannot be farmed. There are exceptions, of course, such as Sacred Stones, Awakening, Birthright, Gaiden/Echoes, and the existence of Arenas, but for the most part, the map-to-map progression sets the tone for the character’s progression of power:  there are a limited number of battles, which means a limited number of enemies, and thus, a limited amount of experience to go around. At its most extreme, like in Radiant Dawn Part One, players can only  train as many non-MC units as they have fingers on one hand, or else they’ll end up horribly under-equipped to do battle with the Greil Mercenaries come Part Three.\n\nThus, players of Fire Emblem won’t invest in every unit that comes their way. Rather, they simply *can’t* do so. It’s not as if they can just go out and commit mass genocide on the nearby population of wild pokemon to level grind. Experience is something that must be rationed, and doled out to only a limited number of units.\n\nAs you might suspect if you’ve been paying attention, Heroes uses a different method and achieves similar results. Heroes ditches the limited EXP. You can get all the experience you want by putting your units through the Training Tower.\n\nHowever, what’s interesting about Heroes is that each unit’s power level is hardly determined by its level. Two units can be level 40, but be worlds apart in power, because of their rarity and their builds, both of which can only be improved by investing feathers. What matters more in Heroes is not Experience, deemed so unimportant by the system that it’s really no more than an afterthought, but rather, Hero Feathers.\n\nUnlike, say, Phantom of the Kill, where players can just run the money farming and evolution material maps and have a resource of materials that is only limited by one’s patience, there is no specific map where players can directly grind for feathers. (The Tempest Trials exist, but even that has a limitation once players hit 99,999.) The exception to this *is* Hero Merit, but even HM is limited by the number of units that a player has in their barracks at any given time, and is less something that players actively grind for outside of specific scenarios and more an added bonus as a result of playing for extended periods of time.\n\nThe result is that Heroes players, like players of mainline Fire Emblem, simply cannot invest in every single unit. The reason not everyone has a full team of +10 units is because there’s no designated farming map that directly pays out feathers, nothing that directly pays out skills, nothing that directly pays out character strength. Like Fire Emblem, Hero Feathers are to be rationed, doled out only to a limited number of units, because the game *has no option* otherwise.\n\nThe other factor unique to Fire Emblem’s character investment is that of random growths. In mainline Fire Emblem, each character has a set of percentages assigned to each stat. With each level-up, each stat has that percent chance of leveling up. Radiant Dawn’s Ike, for example, has a 65% growth in HP and a 55% in Strength, but only a 35% in Speed. This means that, when he levels up, he’s got a 65% to get +1 in HP, 55% to get +1 in Strength, and 35% to get +1 in Speed, so on and so forth. (As a fun fact, the way Heroes handles level ups is a holdover from this. In the mainline, what stat is being boosted is relevant information, because it’s showing the result of a random chance encounter. In Heroes, however, this information is no longer strictly necessary, since each unit has a set of maximum stats that they will end up with. Even if it’s not required, I do think it’s a nice touch regardless.)\n\nThus, the decision to train a unit is not just a long term investment, but it’s also an uncertain one. Even if a unit has a decent strength growth, like Oscar’s 45% in Path of Radiance, the Random Number God could just decide it doesn’t want to ever let them strength up. (As an aside, I’ve never managed to promote Oscar with more than 9 strength. For reference, he gets 17 level-ups before promotion, starts with a base strength of 6, and has an aforementioned 45%. Given how the RNG treats my boy, I half expected to pull a -Attack variant of him in Heroes). \n\nOddly, the way Heroes replicates this isn’t actually present in the base game, but rather, in how it handles shifts in the metagame. Shifts in the metagame determine a unit’s relative strength. YTiki on release, for example, should’ve been, by all rights, a relatively mediocre unit. She was a decent tank, but hardly had the raw power or speed to deal with anything outside her direct wheelhouse, and had a pretty poor base skillset to boot. However, YTiki’s relative strength was very high, because she was often key to countering Hector and Takumi, both incredibly relevant threats in the meta. \n\nTakumi is a reverse example. Defining the meta with Close Counter on release, shifts in the meta and the rise to prominence of bladetomes quickly made him obsolete. It wasn’t that Takumi’s stats were directly nerfed, but his relative strength was neutered by shifts in the metagame.\n\nShifts in the meta aren’t something that anyone can directly predict. While it’s not difficult to parse the broad strokes (IS saw how broken Reinhardt was and released Deflect Magic, IS will probably do something about Bowlyn and the current prominence of Dragons) no one can say with certainty what skills will come out in the future and shape the meta of tomorrow. After all, if someone suggested that a skill would both increase Defense by 4 on enemy phase, and double special cooldown charge for all interactions on the enemy phase, they’d probably be dismissed. But, Steady Breath happened, and it’s something that shaped how powerful Dragons are.\n\nMy point is: You can never really be sure how strong a unit in Heroes will be. You can look up their stats, look at tier lists, but you can never really be sure about a unit’s future potential with each passing meta shift, just as you can never really be sure how a unit in Fire Emblem will grow with each passing level. There’s no way for a longtime player to have known that YTiki would’ve ended up as the utter force of nature that she is today, because it’s not as if we could’ve predicted Skill Inheritance, or predicted Sacred Seals, or predicted the Distant Defense seal, or predicted Steady Breath. Choosing to invest in a unit holds a degree of uncertainty, just as it does in mainline Fire Emblem. \n\n#Conclusion\n\nAs I was looking into the specific game design choices of Heroes, especially with the context of having played Phantom of the Kill for an embarrassingly long period of time, I think it’s really interesting just what the developers did to capture the feeling of playing Fire Emblem.\n\nA lot of the points I touched on aren’t necessarily bad. It’s not necessarily bad to have grinding only be limited by your patience. It’s not necessarily bad to have gameplay that doesn’t hard-line condition players to be extremely careful. But I do think that, for a game that seeks to replicate Fire Emblem, both of those are detriments, and I do think it’s worth celebrating that the developers recognized that and sought to find workarounds in their own mechanics, because the old mechanics simply wouldn’t work in the new format.\n\nYes, Intelligent Systems is currently getting a lot of flak for mishandling various controversial situations, and rightfully so. But I also think it’s wrong to flame them for not knowing what they’re doing, but I think it’s pretty clear that they do.\n\nIt’s for this reason that I also think it’s wrong to write off Heroes just because it’s a mobile game, or just because it doesn’t have permadeath. Heroes does as much as it reasonably can to replicate the feel of Fire Emblem. If Heroes is your first experience with the Fire Emblem series, and the old mechanics are a barrier to entry for you, I understand you. But I also think that it’s much easier to adapt that it might initially seem. I do encourage you to try out some of the main series, because it’s a series that I hold very fondly in my heart. \n\nI originally started writing this essay as an examination of Heroes’s level design, and how the level design captured the spirit of Fire Emblem, but as I did more and more research, I started noticing the level of attention to detail that Heroes has to replicate all of the other aspects of Fire Emblem. All that other stuff eventually ended up ballooning so far that I, er, ran out of space to talk about the initial topic, level design. \n\nThis essay hits the *nine* page mark on my own personal doc. And yeah, some of that is because I type in Reddit’s content format when writing essays specifically for Reddit, so it’s not the most efficient way to format, but some of that is just because… there’s a lot to cover. \n\nMake no mistake, however. I didn’t cut Level Design because there wasn’t enough to cover. I cut level design because it would’ve doubled the length of this essay. There’s still plenty to go. Because Level Design is where it gets *really* fun.\n\nI hope you’ll look forward to that.\n\n-Orange\n",

    "body": "So i heard about the midnight game or the midnight man game, and it looked interesting, so i decided to try it. I dont want to do it alone so i texted 2 of my friends, and gave them the link to a website that gives the description of the game, and the rules. They didnt want to try it. So i thought about it and thought \"hell i used to live in a haunted apartment.. Fuck it ill do it alone.\" \n\nI live in a 2 bedroom house, which isnt big at all so its gonna be a scary ride... I set up my alarm to 3:34am, a minute after 3:33 just in case, (I dont wanna piss off the demon thing) and place it face down since its digital. I shut off everything in the fuse box, except my room for the alarm, shut the blinds, and the ride begins..\n\nIts May 3rd, thursday 11:58 pm, i begin writing my name on the piece of paper, with the candle lit. \n\n11:59pm: I poke my finger and drop a drop of blood on the paper. I have my eye on my iphone, and begin knockin 15 seconds before midnight. On the 22nd knock \"12:00am\" :D i got it, open the door, blow out my candle and close it, and relit my candle. I have my salt and lighter ready, and the ride begins....\n \nIt was dark, i mean pitch black. I was nervous like FUCK. i kept my eye on my candle, ready to grab my lighter. I just kept walking around in the hallway, to my living room, to my room, to the kitchen... It was boring. I felt like if i didnt do it right.. I just kept wondering around and said \"fuck it\". It left like hours already so i went to turn on the kitchen light. But it didnt turn on since i turned off all the power earlier. I held up my candle to the clock in the kitchen and it was only 12:50am.. \nSuddenly.. My candle went off. I FREAKED THE FUCK OUT and lit up the candle as fast as i could, and speedwalked to the living room. I was thinking that i probably blew it out with my nose or something.. But then i heard some whispering behind me. I couldnt make out what it was saying, and it wasnt pleasant. I just kept walking to my room. From that i figured out that i did it right. Then I went into my room, and it was COLD. I mean cold enough that i can see my breath. And again, my candle went out. I cant see shit, i feel goosebumps,   \nAnd CANT FIND MY FUCKING LIGHTER. 5 seconds pass by and i remember that its in my ass pocket and light up the fucking candle thinking its too late. Im still conscious, and leave the room, gasping. My hearts pounding so hard that it looks like i drank a case of red bull. Then i realized that i wasnt even thinking about the salt.. \"Yea im fucked\" i thought... And now im really.. Really scared. In the hallway i look back into my room, and i see the dark figure standing in the doorway. It was staring at me, and i was fucking paralyzed. The candle was still lit and yea u guessed it... It went out. I speedwalk to the living room in the dark reaching for the lighter and light it up again. Now i tell u, i have never been more scared in my life. I was actually shaking. In my living room it was warm again. The relief. Oh the relief. But its not over. \n\nTime passes and not much has happened. I walk to the kitchen wanting to check the time on the clock then i see the man again, sitting in the dining table with its legs crossed. The candle goes out yet again. I light it up and hes gone. By now i fucking regret this shit. I want this to be OVER ALREADY. Im scared for my life right now and im just waiting for that alarm to go off. I keep walking and want to check that time.  I check it and its still 12:50?!   And this is where shit gets real. \n\nI grab the clock from the wall to check if the battery is there and it is. I was wondering if the battery died. With my lit candle in my left hand, and the clock in my right, the candle goes off............. \n\nI panic set the clock on the table, but drop the fuckin candle and rolls away from me. Well... Im fucking fucked. I grab the salt from my left pocket and pour the whole shit around me making the best circle u can imagine. I have lost and im hoping this sodium chloride will protect me from gettin hallucinations/death/whatfuckingever. Im sitting in the kitchen with the salty circle waiting for my alarm to go off. Im scared to check my phone since its gonna give light, and i dont want to risk anything. \n \nStill sitting in the pitch black kitchen, the kitchen window is slightly open, with some wind kickin in. The blinds from the backyard window doors start swinging, allowing some light from the streetlights and what i see made me nearly piss myself a pool. In front of me was the midnight man, just staring at me. He was 6ft-ish tall, kind of see-through, and was completely still, like a statue. This salt was a barrier because he didnt get any closer. He was at least 4 ft away from me. I just kept thinking of that sea bear episode of spongebob to keep myself calm, because i was about to lose it.. \"hahaha dirt circle.. hahaha keeping away from fucking bears... Hahaha stupid squidward cant draw a simple circle. Hahaha...\" \n\nTime kept passing, until finally BEEP BEEP BEEP. My alarm! But i was still scared to move, so i let it ring for a little bit. I waited for the wind to come through again because i cant see shit. I run to the windows and open the blinds for light. Hes gone. The relief was so undescribable i tell u. I turn on the power, and turn on all the lights. I grab the clock and mount it back on the wall only to realize, its working again. And the time is correct. I grab my sleeping bag and sleep the rest of the night in my car. \n\nAnd now i begin to wonder, what if i didnt turn off the power? I turned on the kitchen light thinking the ritual didnt work, and if it turned on i broke the rule. If i broke the rule.. What couldve happen?! \n\nWell im never fucking doing that again and i fucking hope he never comes back. \n\nIf u EVER think about doing it, i recommend u to go to a strip club instead...",

    "body": "The Bridgers quickly move up to the seats reserved for them at the high table as the sword sworn girls join their assigned companions from the garrison for the evening at their own table on the floor. Still excellent visibility and fairly close to their charges if they needed to react... though considering the hall was filled with Apuk warriors and an even dozen battle princesses at least, attacking Jerry or one of the Bridger girls here of all places would be even more suicidal than it normally was.\n\nWith a touch of axiom Jerry genteelly pulls out three chairs for three wives, handling Evie's by hand as his date for the evening, drawing a gentle giggle from the eldest of the Volpiri Bridger wives.\n\n\"No that's wrong, I'm supposed to get your chair!\"\n\nJerry shakes his head. \"I absolutely refuse. The three of you, and your other sisters, deserve all the special treatment I can lavish on you.\"\n\nEvie clearly thinks about arguing, but instead guides Jerry down for a kiss as he seats himself.\n\n\"You humans are crazy, but when it's you, I like crazy.\"\n\nJaruna takes a swig of the water that had been waiting on the table and laughs. \"That's called acclimatization. You've been dealing with our Hubby's brand of crazy so damn long you think it's normal!\"\n\nJunior officers begin to file through the room with trays of glasses. Jerry immediately picks them out as having different tints, red and blue specifically. Most of the guests received red glasses, but occasionally blue glasses were handed out. Finally the young lieutenant selected to serve the high table arrives at their end.\n\n\"Would his highness prefer alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages tonight?\"\n\n\"Alcoholic please.\"\n\nJerry promptly has a red glass set before him, and the color coding suddenly makes sense. Aqi and Evie both receive red glasses, Masha receives a blue glass, and Jaruna receives a Cannidor sized blue tankard. She goes to take a drink but Aqi waves her off.\n\n\"Wait till the toasting begins. This part's all rather ritualized.\"\n\nThe same officer who'd sent everyone to their seats walks to the middle of the room and a horn plays again.\n\n\"Highnesses, gentlemen, ladies, please rise for the presentation of the Imperial standard and the unit colors!\"\n\nThe whole hall is on its feet in a flash, and in short order an honor guard is marching the Imperial war banner and the unit's colors, a bright crimson flag festooned with battle honors and what Jerry assumed were campaign markings. They come to a stop by the mistress of ceremonies, and Miri'Tok, acting as the president of the mess, hoists her cup high.\n\n\"Gentlemen, Ladies, to the Empress!\"\n\nThe hall is filled with hoisted glasses and a mass chorus cries back \"To the Empress!\" in one mighty voice.\n\nEveryone remains on their feet as the Imperial standard and the unit colors are marched to a position of honor near the center of the hall, where all could see them.\n\nThe Mistress of Ceremonies has an assistant come forward with a silk bag that Jerry recognizes as probably containing an Apuk war sword. With broad flourishes the MC strips the silk bag off the sword and passes the bag to the assistant, before drawing the weathered, ancient blade from its sheath. She then marches smartly to a small table before the high table and reverently holds the sword high.\n\n\"We hereby post the sword of one of our fallen sisters in arms, that she, and all of the garrison's dead might walk among us during this special time as a unit, and that we might receive their blessing in death, as we received their companionship and strength in life.\"\n\nMiri'Tok lifts her glass again, and far more solemnly toasts; \"To our fallen, wherever they may walk, may they walk with their sisters with courage.\"\n\nThe rippled response of \"To the fallen\" across the hall is far more subdued than the toast to the Empress.\n\nA jeweled goblet is added to the table with the sword, and filled with what Jerry would guess is a particularly strong spirit, then a place setting is laid out. Not too unlike the POW/MIA table in American military dining facilities and at American formal dining events. Different symbols, different processes, same result and meaning.\n\nStill the hall remains on their feet, waiting until the assistant walks away and the MC moves back to the center of the hall.\n\n\"Would anyone care to propose a toast?\"\n\nIt turned out quite a few people had a toast or two in mind. Jerry was toasted as guest of honor. Aqi was toasted as the overall garrison commander, and Miri'Tok was toasted as president of the mess. Each guest was toasted at least once, with someone finding time to toast Jerry again while they were at it. Jerry himself offered a toast to the garrison, for being such excellent hostesses, which was met with roaring approval from the Apuk warrior women. The Undaunted were toasted as a whole. One cheeky woman toasted all the recently married women of the garrison, which got a solid chuckle from the room. It went on like that for a while, and by the time everyone was settling into their seats completely again, the glasses had been refilled at least once in most cases and everyone was clearly feeling a pleasant buzz from the Apuk beverage referred to as pyrebreath.\n\nPyrebreath was considered very strong by Apuk terms, and thus was a favorite of their various armed forces and anyone who thought she was tough. In reality of course it was basically a low alcohol content but particularly dry white wine. While Jerry preferred his whites a touch on the sweet side, more of a Riesling man than anything else, it was nonetheless a very enjoyable beverage to drink.\n\nDinner was similarly enjoyable, the Apuk propensity towards beautiful meat dishes and lots of them was on full display. Thankfully for the humans present, this particular style of Apuk dining included a bowl of the grain the humans of the Crimson Tear called turtle rice. Nominally to soak up the juices from the meat. More of the pork like leviathan, hot and cold broths. A red meat with an herbed butter that had to be tasted to truly understand how rich it was. Some roasted bird that was quite literally finger licking good. All delectable... and yet Jerry would kill for salad to go with it all. Some sort of vegetable besides the ubiquitous nanak berries. Still that was the nature of carnivore dining. At the very least the meal was far tastier than the bland food humanity had to deal with in the rest of the galaxy.\n\nStill needed a little salt at the very least, but that too was a human exclusive problem in a galaxy that primarily knew sodium chloride as a tool for torture and not a favored seasoning.\n\nFinally the meal comes to an end, and the evening's remaining festivities are cleared to begin, but before they leave their seats, Sergeant Major Gurung rises, and reports sharply to Sir David, who rises in return and dons his beret to return Sergeant Major Gurung's salute.\n\n\"Sergeant Major, deliver the honors.\"\n\n\"Aye aye, sir. Detail! Deliver the honors!\"\n\nSeventeen Apuk warriors had gone into battle to 'rescue' Jerry, and sixteen Commandos counting Sergeant Major Gurung stand forward and move to deliver a Kukri and war belt to each woman, with Sir David himself turning to deliver Miri'Tok's weapon to her. It's a quiet ceremony, save for the initial orders given as the weapons are handed over and each woman receives a personal statement of thanks from her human counterparts. Some get more personal thanks than others, with Miri'Tok and Sir David covertly giving each other's hand a squeeze under the weapons before resuming their seats.\n\nFinally the mistress of ceremonies returns to the floor. \"Highnesses, gentlemen, ladies, we thank you for your attendance this fine evening. This concludes our dinner service and the formal part of our dining in. The bar will remain open for two hours. We invite you to socialize, dance and enjoy the rest of your evening.\"\n\nEvie immediately turns to Jerry with a foxy smile on her face. \"Care to dance handsome?\"\n\n\"Of course. I assume everyone will want at least one trip around the floor, we don't exactly get a lot of opportunities to dance properly aboard the ship.\"\n\n\"Hmmm. Maybe we should look into rectifying it.\"\n\n\"Well we have to have the first Marine Corps and Navy Balls in around half a year.\"\n\n\"Good point.\"\n\nEvie leads Jerry out on the floor, her tight uniform skirt limiting her movement just a hair as she starts to guide him through a dance he'd learned from Syl that was a Volpiri favorite and just so happened to fit the tempo of the song the band was playing.\n\n\"Mhmmm.\"\n\nEvie sighs as she moves into a close hold, nuzzling in against Jerry and holding him just as close as she can while still leaving them actually able to move.\n\n\"Having a good time Evie?\"\n\n\"I can't even begin to tell you how much fun I'm having. Getting to show you off in front of some of the most dangerous women in the galaxy? To point out that even before their princess, I won your heart before her? To have you show me off like I'm the prize. The pride you take in me. In us. Jerry I can't tell you what all that means to me...\" Evie's voice drops to a low, smokey, purr. \"I can promise I'm going to show you just as soon as I can though.\"\n\n\"Well I can certainly say I'm looking forward to that, though it hurts my heart that just treating you with basic dignity can mean so much to you.\"\n\n\"I'm easy to please in the end, love. You've said it before, as have many other human men about their wives I'm sure. You're making up for what amounts to a lifetime of neglect. Multiple lifetimes even. I'm not too far off from two hundred years old, just a few decades. It took me a long time to find you. Not as long as Aqi, but that's a long time to be single. I was... I wasn't too far from giving up hope. From settling. Then you showed up out of nowhere. You made my little sister the happiest woman in the galaxy... then you made me just like her. Made all my dreams come true with that damn crooked smile of yours.\"\n\nEvie chuckles, kissing Jerry's neck gently.\n\n\"Then, after all that, you tell me it's not enough. That you haven't done enough for me. Worked hard enough for me. When you've given me so much, so readily, so easily. Still you offer me more and more because you love me...\" Evie lets out a little sniffle. \"You're amazing. I know it's easy to forget how special you are to us in the context of Earth relationships, but really. You're too much sometimes.\"\n\n\"Heh. Fair enough. It is easy to forget myself sometimes, and fail to understand your perspectives. On the plus side however, when everyone is getting the best possible deal from their perspective, can we really complain too much?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Thank you for making my life an adventure, love.\"\n\nEvie and Jerry dance through the next song in an intimate silence. No words needed to be spoken, they had communicated perfectly, and Evie's eyes were still glimmering as she passes him off to Masha.\n\n\"Hello, gorgeous. Come here often?\"\n\n\"Once upon a time I suppose. Now? Just tonight. Just with you.\"\n\nMasha leads Jerry into the more appropriate dance for this kind of music, proving herself an able dancer and an able instructor.\n\n\"Didn't know you were this talented a dancer, Masha.\"\n\n\"I had to go to charm school like every other Imperial officer and warrior. I hated it at the time, but I'm glad I finally found a use for it.\"\n\nThey dance through a bit longer in a comfortable, intimate silence before Masha finally speaks.\n\n\"I have to know though, what did you do to the new Countess of Vynn? I spoke briefly with Marik'Vynn while waiting to dance with you as she was on her way out the door, and she told me how I have a truly 'wise and generous husband'. She was practically gushing over you. I thought she might ask you to adopt her or some such silliness!\"\n\n“It was just a matter of giving her some options and beyond what the Serbow nobility would normally have. Someone, or rather two someones in authority telling her steering her fief the way she wanted to was okay. A confidence boost, call it.\"\n\n\"A confidence boost that consists of allying herself with the Undaunted?\"\n\n\"It doesn’t have to go like that, but if she wants to clean house, reform her fief and make her holdings a better place for all I'd say that's another able ally on and off Serbow. Apparently the off Serbow part of the Vynn clan isn't nearly as rotten as Adryn'Vynn. We'll have to check that of course, but I'm convinced Marik'Vynn wants to make right for her people... marrying Sergeant Honda doesn't hurt either.\"\n\nMasha chuckles. \"A born diplomat.\"\n\n\"Not really, it's a long practiced and honed skill in the end. Starting with managing my own people, then managing others.\"\n\n\"Mhmm. That's fair. I forget how industrious humans are sometimes. Especially now that you've deaged it's easy to forget you've lived a lifetime's worth of work and experience already.\"\n\n\"That's a consequence of trying to keep my attitude light and cheery in the end. Not that that's hard. I have everything in the galaxy to be happy about after all, and well. I'm young again. I feel... better. Then I spend time with one of you girls, or spend time with some of the babies and I'm just... happy. Overjoyed even. I am beyond blessed to the point that it just... well. I'm glad I joined that suicide mission on Earth. I'm glad everything panned out, and if I'm nothing else, I'm honored beyond words to be husband to you girls, and father to our children.\"\n\nMasha lets out a deep, satisfied sigh.\n\n\"You really can't just say things like that.\"\n\n\"Watch me, gorgeous.\"\n\n\"You're prepared to face the consequences? Once we're on vacation after Aqi's honeymoon of course.\"\n\n\"Work out if it's going to be a tag team with Evie or if you want to take turns.\"\n\n\"I think we can share. More than enough husband to go around after all. Hell I might even lay my clutch soon so I can stop feeling like a blimp.\"\n\n\"You're gorgeous gravid you know.\"\n\n\"Shut it. You're already getting your hips bruised, you don't need to butter me up more.\"\n\n\"You're my wife and soon to be the mother of more of my children, that's every reason to butter you up.\"\n\nAnother few rounds of dancing sees Masha stepping off to go sit down and drink some water, and Jerry offers his arm to Jaruna.\n\n\"Care to join me?\"\n\nJaruna leans down and plants a deep kiss on Jerry's lips.\n\n\"These fancy little gals ain't ready for Cannidor style dancing. Music's a touch slow any way. Maybe we can give it a shot during the family vacation. Sides... Aqi's waiting and it's her big night tomorrow. May as well get started on the 'festivities'.\"\n\nJerry nods. \"Still a bit strange to have the wedding after the marriage.\"\n\n\"Not that strange, we're just having the celebration of the event after the event itself, it's only weird before the event.\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\nAnother kiss, and Jerry moves to take Aqi's hand, leading the raven haired beauty out onto the floor, her crowns glinting in the soft light between her black horns.\n\n\"Sorry about the wait, love.\"\n\nAqi leans in and steals a kiss of her own, giving Jerry a warm, loving smile that makes his heart flutter just a bit.\n\n\"I forgive you... pending a few more kisses of course, and cuddles tonight.\"\n\n\"Mhmm. Your wish is my command.\"\n\nThey dance in silence for a few minutes, Aqi taking the time to teach Jerry a new Apuk style dance as the tempo changes to something even slower still.\n\n\"One more night till our wedding.\" Jerry broaches the subject of the wedding. They'd been waiting for what felt like ages, and at last it was finally here.\n\nAqi gives Jerry an almost shy smile as her emotions bubble up and color her cheeks.\n\n\"I know. Oh goddess I don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep tonight! Never mind tomorrow night! I know it's silly, I'm already your wife after all, but there's just... it's special. I want to announce our love to the entire Empire, to boast to the galaxy of the special treasure I've found with you and the other girls.\"\n\n\"We get to spring our surprise on the rest of the girls too, and that'll be a lot of fun.\"\n\nAqi nods. \"I can't wait to see their faces when they receive their torches. Then there's...\" Aqi blushes again. \"Goodness. You uh. Know what comes next.\"\n\n\"High impact baby making sex following a romantic and passionate deflowering?\"\n\nAqi's eyes go wide. \"...Romantic and... oh goddess you've been reading one of my books haven't you?\"\n\n\"Guilty as charged. I'm really enjoying it too. Exceptional men and exceptional women going out and kicking ass is a lot of fun. Plus the smut's pretty damn spicy. Here's hoping you get as creative as you write once we're all warmed up.\"\n\n\"I... oh goddess.\" Aqi gets control of herself and leans in for a kiss. \"I promise you Jeremiah. I'll show you just how creative I can get...\"\n\n\"Mhmm. Gotta make our first clutch together after all, might as well have fun while we're doing it.\"\n\n\"For tonight though... dance with me a bit longer?\"\n\n\"We can dance as long as you want darling.\"\n\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/pvyw02/out_of_cruel_space_side_story_of_dog_volpir_and/) [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/163pnzj/out_of_cruel_space_side_story_of_dog_volpir_and/) [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/166f997/out_of_cruel_space_side_story_of_dog_volpir_and/)",

Lewd. Then anything an Apuk maiden could probably withstand without A. Getting a nose bleed or B. Passing out, or more likely C. Both. For context the Cannidor appreciate the human tango, but think it could use more body contact between the dance partners and that they could stand to wear less clothing. A lot of dancing between Cannidor spouses is explicitly to show off, and is a VERY clear statement of confidence, and dominance from the Cannidor female. The direct translation for the most popular dance style for couples among the Cannidor warrior class roughly translates to \"Fuck Around And Find Out\".\n\nPast the interesting research detail... I think we all know what comes next. I'll see you all Friday. Make sure to wear something nice. Maybe double check if your suit's been pressed recently. Maybe get it tailored really quick. Even a cheap suit looks better if you throw Mama-san a little cash to get squared away, and there's always pretty girls at weddings on the look out for a potential groom of their own you know. Gotta look sharp. The book release is at noon, and the wedding is at sundown! Be a shame to miss either event. It's going to be a hell of a party.\n\nI will note I did not plan the wedding to line up with the book release, but man I wish I had, that would have been genius! So we'll see how giving this thing a whirl goes.\n\nNext Time: Told you I wasn't gonna milk it\n\n[Kerserv's Archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1LGusDxs73AjK89k0sqKo4C9hoWiOxrIrDk6JYEXT6GY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[PDF Version of ODVM courtesy of No\\_Homework4709](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VTGsgjon4dgGSSyk_0pIa4x13fKDF7an/view?usp=sharing)",

    "body": "Campaign Log #1:\n\n  Hello galaxy, I am general Yog’sholag of the Al’kasha Dominion. I am writing this log because, well, I’m mandated to. For being a dominion, the AD really likes its transparency. That is until the inquisition is brought up, but that’s not something I’m supposed to talk about in detail. Anyway, I’m being sent to command a portion of a campaign on the planet Isarateph. Fairly standard rebellion, nothing too much. Except, of course, one thing. \n\nRecently a species of tall, soft-skinned, symmetrical beings has been contacted. They call themselves “humans”. Their system is average, of an average age, with an average star. Their spacial environment is so average it’s hard to believe they’re so different from anything I’ve ever seen. A contingent of these creature’s soldiers have been assigned to my army. As volunteers. Not as conscripts or slaves, but volunteers. I told you they’re weird. \n\nThey seem to come from every part of their mother planet from what I understand, some from a place called “Emeriga”, others from “Jermani”, and some from a weird place I don’t even know how to spell. Rooseea? Roshya? Rushah? I don’t know.  Anyway, they arrive tomorrow. I will give further details about them then.\n\nCampaign log #2:\n\n  You know how I said they were tall? Yeah, they’re huge. At least one size of their head taller than me, and twice as wide. They have four limbs, the two lower ones as large around as my main propulsor limb. Their upper limbs could easily fit my head inside of them. \n\nThere seems to be two different types, one is slightly larger and more muscular than the other, with a flatter front and straighter side. The other is slightly shorter, and has weird lumps on their front. I tried to touch them to see what they felt like against my tentacles, but the human stepped back and placed one of its limbs between me and it. I was then informed that those lumps played a significant part in mate selection and humans don’t want them touched. I gave my apologies and carried on. It then struck me how weirdly wide these types get when their lower limbs break off from their central section. I again tried to physically examine this area of the human, but then stopped after remembering what happened last time I tried examining this one.\n  \nTheir skin is of a weird color too. They seemed to reflect off the light which hits them, some of them radiated brighter and some radiated darker. They have weird tufts of fur on the top of their heads as well. On the larger types, these were generally short and non-styled. On the smaller, though, they were long. Long and appeared to be made into natural ropes of some kind. Perhaps they use these to pull their comrades up from lower areas. \n\nTheir foodstuffs as well are incredibly unique. At one time beautiful and disgusting in both appearance and smell. Some of these foods were in flat disks, with other flat discs on top of the main disk. Others were tiny pellets of plant matter covered in some sort of animal product. Another kind, this one confused me in particular, was a long, dark tube twisted and knotted on itself. It was rather soft on the inside, and had a covering of sodium chloride. I will have to ask more of them later.\n\nAnyway, I said I’m a general, and a general leads an army. This is what I shall do tomorrow, and give these humans their first test. I suspect them to do poorly, with their soft skin and all.\n\nCampaign log #3:\n\n  By the divine ones, the humans are amazing, I’d say that they are the only reason my disastrous plan actually worked. First, I must describe my plan: I planned to attack a lightly defended outpost with a group of soldiers easily out numbering the defenders. It turned out that the outpost was a heavily defended camp of rebels, staffed with such numbers as to equal my own force. I put the humans on the sides of my formation, where the lightest resistance would naturally be located. \n\nThe humans performed to a degree where they appeared as blood thirsty demons, coming to take the souls of the defenders to Jaskolo (hell, essentially). They merely stepped over the defensive barricade, the defenders guns having an effect that can only be described as slowing the human soldiers down. \n\nHuman guns ripped the defenders apart, with sounds liked that of a plasma burst. When the humans could no longer fire, they switched to their hand weapons. Although appearing crude, being a sharpened piece of metal on a synthetic haft, they cleaved through the defenders, multi-colored liquids spewing forth from their open wounds, cover the human attackers. Within minutes, the humans had cleared the side defenses of the stronghold. \n\nAt this time, my center was slowing, my men were about to rout, when the humans appeared. Flame spurted from their weapons, liquids dripped from their bodies and weapons. At the sight of this, my army was both shocked and amazed. My soldiers morale was immediately bolstered, human and Al’kash fighting alongside each other. Where one part of the line faltered, a human warrior appeared, waving their weapon, yelling threats to the enemy and swearing by their life they would kill all they could. \n  \nAfter just a few minutes, the entirety of the remaining defenders surrendered. Then, in a frightening change of emotion, the humans accepted them. They were sheltered, given nourishment, and put inside of rooms. How could a group so mad as to charge headlong into an army of thousands with only a melee weapon be so kind and generous to their once enemies? How could such a master of war have a dominion so small.\n  \nThey must lack intellect! They must be brutes, relying on strength and rage. But that makes no sense, the humans acted with obviously clear heads. They saw where they were needed, knew how to rally my troops, and then treated the enemy with kindness. How could a creature as such not be intelligent? How are they not the rulers of all space and time, why have we contacted them and not the other way around? I have so many questions to ask theses humans. All this, and they’re only volunteers.\n\nNext part will be up in the coming days, I’ll put its link here when it does. I’m still on school, so that will complicate my writing. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed. If you have any comments, please comment them. Thank you.",

    "body": "\"I don't understand,\" Klirk said as he watched Joe tip the first shipping crate into the crater, \"why you humans insist on burying your waste in accessible locations instead of tossing it into a star like everyone else does.\"\n\nJoe pushed the next crate over the crater's rim and shrugged.  \"You know how our digestion works?\"\n\nKlirk extruded another, higher resolution, eyespot and studied his host carefully.  Past experience told him that Joe was more likely to be taking a circuitous route to the answer because he thought it would increase understanding when he finally reached that answer, as opposed to dodging the question--but it was difficult to be certain.  \"Mechanical grinding, followed by extended soaking in an acid bath, before you finally get around to enzymatic processing.  Seems horribly inefficient.\"  As if to illustrate, he extruded a pseudopod in the direction of a bit of organic matter that must have escaped from an improperly sealed crate.\n\nJoe noticed.  \"And now you're stuck standing there for at least ten minutes unless you want to abandon a mil of your nutrient extraction cells.  Whereas i could pop a piece of food that size into my mouth, walk away, and have the indigestible bits come out the other end as part of a routine waste dump.  As long as i keep my fiber intake balanced correctly, those deposits rarely take more than a couple of minutes.\"\n\n\"But i,\" Klirk countered, \"do not have to worry about being poisoned by any of those indigestible bits.  I can pick and choose what to ingest at the molecular level, and so will not inadvertently ingest anything toxic.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, suuuuuuuuure,\" Joe said.  \"That's why your council had to ask us to ban certain artificial sweeteners.\"\n\n\"All right, so there are a few compounds that can fool our enzymes long enough to foul their function.  Far fewer than your species is vulnerable to, however.\"\n\n\"Fewer, sure, but mostly not the same ones.\"  Joe shrugged.  \"The point is that there are always tradeoffs.  Anyway, it was that 'acid bath' that i was specifically wanting to draw attention to.  You know that sodium is one of the main ions involved in our nerve transmission?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Mind boggling, given the amount of water in your bodies.  Also, had us baffled as to why you would use such an inefficient mode of signal propagation--until some genius noticed that it allowed your nerves to incorporate local data into the signal without interrupting it.  Our data-engineers are still trying to figure out a digital equivalent.\"\n\n\"I see we aren't alone in getting our best tech from bio-mimicry,\" Joe said with a grin wide enough to be visible through the distorting effect of his vac-suit's quasi-transparent faceplate.  \"Anyhow, as you implied knowing, pure sodium reacts explosively with water.  Chlorine is toxic, to us--and, if i'm not mistaken, to your species as well, if you're prevented from minimizing your surface area.  But sodium chloride would be about as inert as a compound can get were it not soluble in water.\"\n\nKlirk saw where this was going.  \"Water to separate the sodium from the chlorine; use the sodium for your nervous system--but then that leaves an equal quantity of now-toxic chlorine to dispose of.\"\n\n\"Or put to work.  Hydrochloric acid is almost too potent for our purposes, but that's solved by diluting it somewhat.  Water, partially, and the mucous secretions that protect the stomach lining.\"\n\n\"So what would be an inefficient digestive process is rendered efficient by the fact that is simultaneously solving a hazmat disposal problem,\" Klirk concluded.\n\nJoe shook his head.  \"I still don't see what's so inefficient about our digestion.  Mechanical grinding to maximize surface area during the remainder of the process, acid bath to denature any enzymes that might try to eat us back, then proceed with onboard enzymatic digestion that allows us to literally eat and run.\"\n\n\"Except that your bodies have to shut down digestion in order to use your muscles at full capacity,\" Klirk pointed out.\n\n\"And?\" Joe countered.  \"That only delays, not prevents.  Whereas if you get interrupted while eating, you might be forced to sacrifice a bit of body mass along with losing half you dinner.  We take it with and can finish the job later.\"\n\n\"We are capable of picking things up and taking them with us,\" Klirk reminded the human.\n\n\"At the risk of absorbing some of those toxic compounds you bragged about being to exclude.\"\n\nKlirk conceded the point.  \"So:  somehow, your body's ability to covert hazardous waste into something useful--this translates into not throwing anything irretrievably away because...?  Because you think you might find a use for it someday?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Joe said.  \"There are no useless materials; only materials for which we have not yet found a use.\"  He tipped the last crate into the crater.  \"Actually, we can use a lot of this stuff now, it's just not worth the effort it would take to separate it from the rest.\"\n\n\"So you leave it here until your recycling technology improves or the supply depletes to a point where it is worth the effort?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Joe said slowly.  \"We learned the hard way that centrifugal separation and solar smelting was a bad combination.\"\n\n\"Too much debris,\" Klirk agreed.  \"I think that was the last time we tried a mechanical solution to a problem--until we met your species, that is.\"\n\n\"I guess we're just mechanically inclined,\" Joe said.  He waited for Klirk to groan at the old joke and then went on, \"Gravitational separation, on the other hand, works just fine--provided the asteroid you're melting is large enough.  So we pick an asteroid that's a bit below that threshold, keep tossing our trash here until it's over it, then tip it into a close-solar elliptical orbit.  Give it a few passes to separate by density, and then start strip mining that sucker.\"\n\n\"I really don't see how you can consider a mining process that slow to be 'efficient',\" Klirk objected.\n\n\"It's the old time vs. energy tradeoff.  If you're planning for the long haul, slow doesn't matter.  Take enough time, and you spend more energy running the traffic control simulations than you do adjusting the orbit.\"\n\nKlirk shuddered.  \"Your computers...  We though we knew what brute force was from you weapons systems.  And then...  Cramming that processing power into smaller and smaller packages does not make it any less a brute force approach!  You still think it's all about the flops.\"\n\n\"We know that certain problems are digitally insoluble without quantum computing,\" Joe objected.\n\nKlirk extruded a dozen more eyes just so he could roll them all.  \"Trying all solutions simultaneously instead of a select subset.  That's more brute force, not less.\"\n\nAs they walked back to Joe's garbage truck, the argument remained at full boil.",

So doing this would essentially be the equivalent of throwing a single dart at a galaxy-sized dartboard while blindfolded.\n\nThe way quantum computers actually work is more akin to a precise scalpel than the cosmic sledgehammer they are frequently depicted as.\n\nEssentially, they take advantage of the fact that they operate on quantum mechanics instead of classical probabilities to carefully orchestrate the quantum states so that the incorrect answers all cancel each other our, while the correct ones reinforce each other so that when you finally get around to observing the quantum state holding your result, it is almost guaranteed to collapse into the correct answer. As you can imagine, this is an extremely delicate and precise process, and, as far as we know, it is only applicable to a precious few problems.\n\nNow, if you still want a cosmic sledgehammer computer, then what you should go for is Closed Timelike Curve (CTC) computers. These are computers that use time travel to send their computations back in time repeatedly, giving themselves infinite time to work on a problem. There is no evidence that they would be possible, but regardless we have a pretty good idea of what they could do (in short, anything that doesn't require a planet's worth of storage space) and what they couldn't (in short, not much). If you're interested in the topic, you already know what they're called, and there's a handful of other wild ideas like that under the umbrella of hypercomputation, including propositions like \"jump into a black hole to travel to the end of the universe, by which time your computation will be done\"\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry for yelling, it's just, you've got to understand, I studied quantum computers for two years, I know all about them, it's my area of expertise, and I keep seeing that claim repeated that isn't even a simplification, it's just plain wrong, and it huuuuuurts...",

    "body": "Bungie was kind enough to post [a preview of some early concept gear](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/149/149565/Nova_Gear.jpg?cv=3983621215&av=2588261113) currently slated for Witch Queen in [the latest news update](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/50124) and as a lore nerd I figured I'd break down the aesthetic to think about what it means and where it might drop.\n\nTL;DR **These armor sets represent the \"three primes\" or base materials according to the alchemist Paracelsus: mercury (Hunter), salt (Titan) (hee hee), and sulfur (Warlock). Based on the alchemy references, modern aesthetic, and fish-star symbol resembling the drawing of Europan deep-ocean life in Clovis Bray's journal, I believe these armor sets are from Europa, possibly prestige raid gear for DSC.**\n\nOverall we have clean, modern military gear with heavy fabrics and plastics. It's decorated with a lot of wild-looking symbols, but they're in crisp digital fonts instead of scrawled or etched like Hive runes. There are also a few letters and numbers hidden in there, most obviously the Titan's \"Na\" and \"Cl\" shoulderpads.\n\nThe Hunter gear has no letters, but does have the number \"80\" on the upper left of the vest and \"200.59\" on the upper right. The Titan mark has two numbers too small to make out, but has a clear \"Na\" on one shoulderpad and \"Cl\" on the other. The Warlock kit has the letter \"S\" and the numbers \"16\" and \"32.066\". These refer to the chemicals mercury, salt, and sulfur, respectively. Mercury's atomic number is 80 and its standard atomic weight is 200.592. Table salt (sodium chloride) has the chemical formula NaCl. Sulfur, symbol \"S\", has the atomic number 16 and standard atomic weight 32.06.\n\nSome symbols, like the moon-phases, fish-star, and seven-pointed star, are shared across all three gear sets. The unique symbols on each set also refer to their elements. On the Hunter kit, the three larger symbols, ☿, 🝁, and the one that's like mercury plus the shrug emoji, are all different glyphs for mercury; alchemists would use multiple glyphs for the same element to confuse anyone trying to read their Super Ancient Magical Secrets. The vest's two small triangles refer to Water (🜄) and Air (🜁).\n\nOn the Titan's gear, the circle with a single horizontal line (🜔 if your unicode is working) is Paracelsus' glyph for salt; the circle with dots and the one on the mark that looks like mercury folded inside-out are probably more salt glyphs. The little cube diagrams also illustrate the crystal cell structure of salt (spoilers: it's a cube). I can't read the numbers, but I'm guessing they're density, molar weight, something like that.\n\nFor the Warlock, the up triangle on a stick (🜍) and double cross over an infinity symbol (🜏) are both sulfur glyphs, so the plus with a dot, triangle with arrows (edit: confirmed as \"Sulfur of Philosophers\" by u/KaiOT_gaming), and wiggly half-infinity symbol are probably more sulfur. The triangles near the \"16\" and \"32.066\" are Fire (🜂) and Earth (🜃), which makes sense given sulfur's association with fire and gunpowder.\n\nWhy these three chemicals? The 16th-century alchemist Paracelsus, who defined most of the later work, called mercury, salt, and sulfur the *tria prima* or three prime materials of creation that made up all other matter. Mercury, because it was metallic yet a liquid, transcended states and therefore represented the mind. Sulfur represented the spirit. Together they combined into salt (not really, please don't mix mercury and sulfur) which represented the body. That makes sense for a Titan, but personally I think the Warlock should be the mind and the Hunter be the spirit. Then again I'm not a concept artist, what do I know.\n\nClovis Bray was big into alchemy as a metaphor for his Exo creation project. He saw his pursuit of transmuting faulty digital uploads into genuine, sane transplanted consciousnesses as similar to alchemical mystics trying to isolate fundamental materials of creation or life. When he developed the denatured radiolaria fluid he called it the \"alkahest,\" an alchemical term for a universal solvent, and the \"stone\" in \"Deep Stone Crypt\" refers to the philosopher's stone. The DSC in general combines a modern, scientific aesthetic with pseudo-mystical content. Concept artist Dima Goryainov talked about the graphics he designed for the DSC as \"scientific hieroglyphs\" - appearing technical from a distance, but up close encoding more mystical content. This armor's aesthetic, combining a sleek modern look with ancient alchemy, fits quite well into that overall idea. Therefore I think this might be prestige raid gear for the DSC. We know Bungie's talked about bringing back \"hard modes\" for raids, if not exactly the old prestige system, and harder raids means fancier gear.\n\nBut either way this is a wicked-looking armor set and I'm hype to pick it up wherever it comes from. Especially the salt :D .",
