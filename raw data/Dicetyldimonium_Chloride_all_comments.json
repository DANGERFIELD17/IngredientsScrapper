    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

It's been a month now and OP, I can't thank you enough for your post. \n\nI have 2B curls with fine hair and it was damaged (bleaching, color, heat treatment 😭) before I started CGM. I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

According to their description it's silicone free. So I called to inquire as they confirmed this. I went to the store, purchased this item and had been using it for about 3 weeks. \n\nIn that time I had developed this aweful residue spot on the back if my head and couldnt figure it out. Finally I looked at the ingredient list and clear as day it lists Dimethicone. Now this caused me a little frustration but I thought I would call and complain.\n\nhere is the list of ingredients : Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Glutamic Acid, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nThen started the most ridiculous conversation with the Pantene product support people I have ever had.\n\nIn a nut shell, They insisted I use a shampoo, wanted to send me a pamphlet on how to properly use their product and when I was willing to overlook the fact that I'm not an idiot and was explaining that the issue was now how I was using it but that they mis-advertized their products, and said it was silicone free. The stupid lady tried telling me that DIMETHICONE is NOT silicone. \n\nSo that's when I realized that my perceptions of Pantene as a brand where not what I thought and they in fact don't know what they are talking about and as a result I will no longer trust them with being a quality product if they don't understand their own ingredients.\n\nBreath....end vent..\n\nwas I wrong? Because I was 95% sure Dimethicone is a silicone based polymer. Its in fact one of the most obvious silicone products.\n\nI might call back when i have calmed down and approach it as an allergy issue because they clearly are misrepresenting the product as far as I can tell and as soon as they find I don't use shampoo they don't seem to care.",

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition.

    "body": "I've been using Formulate shampoo and conditioner for about 10 weeks now and I'd like to share my thoughts with you wonderful people who have taught me so much! I was so curious about these before I bought them, but I couldn’t find many reviews from people who follow CGM or have curly/wavy hair.\n\nAbout my hair: I have type 2 (ranging from a-c in different places on my head), fine, medium porosity, protein loving hair that is a bit longer than shoulder length. It has light bleach damage on the bottom 1/4 of it. \n\nAbout my routine: I live in Phoenix, AZ where it is very hot and very dry most of the time. I have pretty hard water, so I switch between using this shampoo and using a light chelating shampoo (Bb Sunday shampoo). I shampoo then condition and STC upside down. I detangle with a wetbrush and drizzle rinse out the conditioner, then using a TON of water, I scrunch in a defining cream, usually AG Re:coil, then glaze and scrunch in Harry's gel. I pixie diffuse to 80% dry and root clip, then SOTC once 100% dry.\n\nFormulate review: I started with the 8oz. size of both shampoo and conditioner (ingredients listed below).  I set my preferences to be no dyes, no anti-brass, silicone free (all formulate products are sulfate and paraben free). There are options to make them vegan and gluten free, but I did not select those.\n\nThe hair concerns I chose for them to base the ingredients off of were number one curl definition (lol wavy probs) followed by improve scalp health, prevent thinning, volumize and anti-frizz. For scent I chose Tidal for my first round (described as Ocean, Sage, Lily and Musk). \n\nI wasn’t really expecting to be that blown away by these. I've tried function of beauty and really didn't like it. I was considering Prose, and got these instead as a way to talk myself out of spending Prose money and I am SO GLAD I DID. I never knew I could love a shampoo and conditioner, I'm not a brand loyal person and almost never get the same thing twice because I like to experiment, but I will not be straying from these anytime soon. The shampoo is A GAME CHANGER. It has so much slip and is so hydrating I could honestly detangle my hair with just the shampoo in it. It feels so good and lathers well, leaves my scalp feeling actually clean. It has a weird consistency, there's a jelly-like substance mixed into a more traditional shampoo-like substance, but it doesn't really bother me at all when I'm using it. The conditioner is similarly amazing - so much slip, super moisturizing. It gives me such good definition, I mean better than most curl definers, that I started drizzle rinsing, something I’ve never done before, to leave some of it in even though it's not meant to be a leave in. It is shocking how much definition and clumping action it gives my hair!! \n\nLike most CGM users, and because I use my chelating shampoo every fourth wash day or so, I went through the conditioner faster than the shampoo and am now on my second bottle. I've sized up so now my conditioner will be 16oz. and my shampoo will be 8oz. I AM IN LOVE. I switched to a new scent because Tidal smells a bit too much like a man for my personal preference. I set my scent level to medium and I will say it does linger, not overpoweringly, but your hair will smell faintly like it even on day 2. \n\nMy formula does contain a little protein in both the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loves protein, so that's cool with me! Plus I feel it helps balance out the moisture. I suspect it's part of the reason I get such good definition from these. If you are considering trying Formulate, I cannot recommend it highly enough and truly feel it is worth every penny. In the past I've tried TGIN, Jessicurl, DevaCurl (pre-scandal) and As I Am, and nothing compares to Formulate, including products from my pre-CGM days.\nPackaging is really nice, although I wish they would offer the sustainable option to just get refills every month instead of new plastic bottles. I love the ease with which you can make edits to formula and cadence and bottle size. Having access to the formulation chemist and technician so you can talk to them if you have concerns or want changes instead of a call-center type of person is a really nice touch. The website has this awesome feature where it will tell you what every single ingredient is and why it’s there, which is so nice if you’re trying to learn more about hair care ingredients. \nI will say they put a weird amount of emphasis on whether you are a “him or a her” in their hair quiz and that’s just so dumb in my opinion. Hair has no gender, I can’t imagine why they need to know this, and they should have more options than the binary if it’s that important to them. Also it’s really hard even once you have an account to circumvent the stupid quiz and just login. Like way more annoying than it needs to be. These are my only complaints though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Very highly recommend these, worth every penny imo!!\n\nIngredients in my shampoo: Purified Water, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Diglycerin, Cocamide MIPA, At Dawn(scent), Methyl Gluceth-20, Guar Gum, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Polyquaternium-7, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-6 Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate, Polyglyceryl-6 Ricinoleate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Sesame Seed Oil, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Saw Palmetto, Sweet Almond Oil, Avocado Oil, Vitamin C, Beta-Sitosterol, Hemp Seed Oil, Vitamin E, Citrus Fruit Acid, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Broccoli Seed Oil, Aloe Vera\n\nIngredients in my condiitoner: Purified Water, Polyquaternium-7, Diglycerin, At Dawn(scent), Polyquaternium-32, Lecithin, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oilseed Turnip, Butyl Stearate, Polyquaternium-37, Mineral Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polyglycerol-2 Laurate, Acetamide MEA, Sesame Seed Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Propanediol, Phenylpropanol, Argan Oil, Methyl Gluceth-20, Keratin Oil, Vitamin B5, Sweet Almond Oil, Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, Avocado Oil, Oleoyl Sarcosine, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Coconut-Derived Cleanser, Saw Palmetto, Guar Gum, p-Anisic Acid, Levulinic Acid, Vegetable Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Lactic Acid, Sodium Lactate, Carbamide, Starch Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Vitamin C, Hemp Seed Oil, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitol, Beta-Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Polysorbate 80, Vitamin E, Jojoba Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid, Wheat Germ Oil, Wheat Germ Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Vitamin E, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Aloe Vera, Broccoli Seed Oil, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Citrus Fruit Acid\n\nEdit: formatting",

I'm only able to use conditioner on the lengths of my hair but I need to avoid my scalp completely. It also doesn't have to be a preservative you're allergic too, it's pretty common that menthol, peppermint or coconut oil is causing this. I know several people to be allergic to coconut oil. You could consider patch testing for those if you haven't yet.\n\nObviously you should stop using this conditioner asap. It sounds pretty bad, and it can take a while to recover. It took me two months to recover from those 2 co-washes I've done. Especially because it's back at full force, that's a huge sign something is up.",

Cationic agents also help to condition, although differently (behentrimonium chloride is my favourite, but you'll see cetrimonium chloride and various polyquaterniums around).\n\nI have super sensitive skin, so I use a conditioner base designed for mixing with essential oils, then don't mix anything with it.

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you 🙏🏻🖤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

A few weeks ago I used [Overtone Espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1gg42bd/before_and_after_espresso_overtone_conditioning/) and this week I used Aura Bold Sonoma red.

The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey.

Your hair is wavy so if you wanted to go CG method you could. I put both of these in and the shampoo is approved with caution (meaning some ingredients might not work for everyone but if it works for you keep using it) and the conditioner was not approved based on the inclusion of Isododecane which is not a silicone but it is insoluble in water and can act as one in the sense that it can prevent your hair from getting “real” moisture.\n\nOverall that being the only unapproved ingredient tells me these are probably alright to be using and shouldn’t damage your hair or dry it out. If you notice any product buildup or your roots being more oily than normal you can use a clarifying treatment and if your hair seems like it’s still not getting moisturized from the shaft down you could try getting a deep conditioning mask to do once or twice a week. If all else fails you could just switch to a new shampoo and conditioner after you use these up.",

        "body": "All of the above. Coconut oil and shea butter act to coat the hair. This coating feels waxy. Clarifying helps, but you are putting it right back in your hair. Switch products. Start omitting the shea butter first. Generally that solves most buildup issues. If it doesn't omit the coconut. I cannot use shea butter or coconut (oil, water, milk) - I tried for months. Now I use Giovanni Eco Chic 50:50 shampoo and Smooth As Silk conditioner. They have a coconut derivative but no shea. I also dropped any leave in, curl cream, or gel. Only mousses.  Mielle Curly mousse for curl definition and Giovanni Air Turbo Styling foam for hold. My hair recovered and I got brave and tried a MopTop sample set. Disaster! Went back to my Giovanni.",
