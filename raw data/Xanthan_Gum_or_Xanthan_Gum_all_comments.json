    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

        "body": "*TL;DR for anyone scrolling past*\n\n* LO Retinol + Gluta uses retinyl palmitate and not retinol, which is a low potency variant of retinol that requires extra conversion steps to get the same effects as retinol. Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "I figured alongside top secret recipes I could discuss some top secret recipe tips here. In relation to the sub, these two ingredients are found in just about all commercialized recipes requested here. If you’re attempting to create a copycat, they could very well be the missing link.\n\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Lecithin \n\nWhile the two might sound scary, they’re anything but. As Ann Reardon once said (paraphrasing), if I told to you add sodium bicarbonate to your recipe would you be skeptical? That’s just baking soda. While you shouldn’t take health advice from someone on the internet, knowingly or not, you’re already most likely consuming both of these additives on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n**Xanthan Gum**\n\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail which I’m unqualified to speak on, xanthan gum is a plant based powder that can be useful in everything from emulsifying to thickening.\n\n\nI recreate a lot at home and there’s always something missing from homemade sauces, thickness. If you’ve ever tried your own, you know what I mean. No amount of emulsification or reducing will leave you with the smooth thick texture of something store bought. That’s where xanthan gum comes to play. Sometimes you’ll achieve the perfect flavor in something seemingly watered down. In the standardized thickening process you’ll lose that original flavor and end up going back and forth for a while before just giving up and settling. That’s because the vast majority of sauces out there use xanthan gum as the primary source of thickening. I’ve even used it on buffalo sauce to coat chicken wings better. \n\n\nIts uses can surprisingly spread far. You can throw some in an ice cream base for smoother ice cream, or even in a hot chocolate for a latte texture. When making something like a relish, xanthan gum can also be useful in preventing the ingredients from separating. \n\n\nYou’re definitely going to want a scale when messing with this stuff but I’d be a liar if I told you I’ve never free balled it. You typically want to start at 0.05% of your liquid weight and move up in low increments until you’ve achieved your desired consistency. 0.35% would be the maximum you should use so watch out or you’ll ruin your recipe. \n\n\n**Soy Lecithin**\n\n\nLecithin is simply the god of ingredients when it comes to baking and it also happens to be another great emulsifier. If you want to take your kitchen to the next level, this is the next step. With it, not only will your sauces bind but your food will stay fresher and more moist for longer. It’s almost a necessity in baked goods. \n\n\nBasically, lecithin powder just holds onto moisture really well. It will keep things soft for days and prevent staling. It’s perfect for any baked goods you want to remain moist. Almost all of commercialized soft baked goods use this but also restaurants that prepare items a day or so in advanced. It’s also great for breads! \n\n\nYou can also get lecithin in liquid form for perfect emulsification that won’t split. One downside is that liquid lecithin is hydrophobic so it will only work well with oil based sauces like salad dressings, for example. \n\n\nThe ratio for lecithin in baking is pretty self explanatory. Just 1% of the flour weight. For liquid lecithin in emulsification, you want to use 1% of the oil. \n\n\nBoth of these ingredients are tasteless and can be incorporated into your daily use. They have no affect on recipes apart from their intended purposes so everything else stays exactly the same including ingredients, measurements, and process. \n\n\nI tend to see a lot of copycat recipes fail simply because they try to get around and avoid using some necessary ingredients. It’s been stated here before but the vast majority of chain restaurant and commercial products are developed using an abundance of ingredients not available in your typical grocery store. While not for everyone, these two ingredients are almost a powerhouses in commercial cooking but can also be used in your normal day to day recipes. Why not give it a shot? Experiment a bit. Take the time to crack your favorite recipes yourself or just improve your everyday meals. Both can be found on Amazon at affordable prices.",

For instance, at the restaurant we use it to thicken and smooth out vegetable purees, but rather than add it to the buttery purée, you would blend it into some water or wine, then add to the pan. Not sure why, but it has a much more reliable effect.",

    "body": "Hi Reddit!\n\nI work for Nestle Prepared Foods in Solon, Ohio. I'm a member of the team that designs products for brands like Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine, and Buitoni. I'm happy to answer any questions that you have. Just keep in mind that I can't divulge anything confidential.\n\n[Here's Verification](http://imgur.com/ASz0n)\n\nThe requester had some questions:\n\nQ: Does it ever look like what's on the packaging?\n\nWe use the actual product when we do photo shoots, but the photographers take some \"artistic liberties.\" They might position the ingredients in a particular way or put the product on a plate or something like that. Part of our job as the food technologists is to make sure that the photographers don't go too far to the point that the photo is misleading.\n\n\nQ: What is in TV Dinners that we're happy not knowing about?\n\nNot much really. This is a bit of a misconception. Actually our frozen meals don't need to be formulated with preservatives because freezing is the only preservative we need. The weirdest thing you're going to find on the label is probably xanthan gum, which is just a carbohydrate that serves as a thickener. In our factories, we make the meal from scratch, assemble the components in a tray, freeze it, put it in a box, and ship it to you. Pretty simple.\n\n\nQ: What kind of testing goes on?\n\nWe do all sorts of tests. We're given lots of contstraints that we have to meet, and our job as food technologists is to formulate a product that meets all of the requirements. We have to design something that can feasibly be made in our factory, at a particular cost limit, within a set of nutritional requirements, without posing any safety concerns, while still delivering on product quality.\nSo we begin by trying out different formulations in our test kitchen that meet those requirements. We test and test until we get a product that we're happy with, and then we scale it up. We do tests on a larger scale to make sure that the product we envisioned can actually be made in the factory. We test just about anything you can imagine as long as the company feels the cost of the test is justified.\n\n\nEdit1:  Thanks for the questions, guys. I need to go to bed now, but I can answer more questions in the morning. Cheers!\n\nEdit 2: Wow, lots of questions! I'll do my best before I have to leave for work.\n\nEdit 3: I did my best...forgot to drink the tea that I brewed...but I have to go to work. I'll answer some more questions as I get time. Bye for now!\n\nEdit 4: To be safe, I have to make it clear that anything I posted in this AMA is solely reflective of my personal views and not necessarily those of Nestle.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! Due to a recent posting of misinformation being spread on here, excessive worrying over ingredients, and people PMing me for advice I figured I would just make a post about this to help other people with similar questions\n\nFor background, I am a chemist- in particular a biochemist. I used to work in a research area that focused on mineral/ion- skin absorption. I'll try to hit the ones that aren't in the side bar already and separate them out by category for easy viewing. Let me know if I missed any big ones!\n\n**Emulsifiers - keep oil/water based chemicals from separating in products**\n\nMost common products I see contain polysorbates, laureth-4, glyceryl monostearate (also pearlescent agent)\nlauramide DEA (also foam booster), or potassium cetyl sulfate. There's also stearic acid that also helps with cleansing. These aren't necessarily bad for you nor are they good for you. They're kinda meh ingredients that exist to make the product work \n\n**Preservatives- extend their shelf life and are anti microbial**\n \nparabens- these get a lot of flack but there isn't that much research confirming their 'toxicity'. The [original study] (http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf) that brought them into the spotlight was over hyped by the media and dozens of other studies done afterwards have yet to find a definite link to cancer or other diseases. These are however very great preservatives\n\nBenzyl alcohol containing products has been known to dry some people out due to it's status as an alcohol. Aside from a preservative it's also used as a ph balancer\n\nformaldehyde- if you see this in a product, you may want to be wary. The World Health Organization has determined this to be a carcinogen; however whether trace amounts are as bad for you is still unknown\n\n tetrasodium EDTA/ disodium EDTA- normally these are used to draw metals out of the blood, but in terms of skincare, both work to stabilize the product by binding other chemicals. Only concern with this one is that it's an environmental hazard \n\nPhenoxyethanol -  an antimicrobial \n\nethylhexylglycerin - helps with eczema and also works for some people with rosacea \n\n**Moisturizers : Lipid thickeners - give product it's creamy consistency**\n\ncetyl alcohol, stearic acid and carnauba wax are the big ones- aren't bad, rarely cause things like breakouts for most people. These are also good at protecting the moisture barrier from water loss by forming a 'seal' \n\n**Moisturizers : Natural thickeners - come from nature, usually work as humectants (think hyaluronic acid)**\n\nhydroxyethyl cellulose, guar gum, xanthan gum and gelatin are the most popular\n\n**Moisturizers: Mineral thickeners - also natural, absorb both oils and retain water**\n\nmagnesium aluminium silicate, silica and bentonite are the big ones here. A lot of clay masks and some silicone based (neutrogena) sunscreens are apart of this category. Silicone based sunscreens are great for those who's skin can handle them since they keep oils/shine in check while also preventing your skin from overdrying\n\n**Moisturizers: synthetic thickeners - used in a lot of gel type products and some of the rich/smooth white creams**\n\ncarbomer, cetyl palmitate, and ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate are common ones\n\n**Emollients - soften the skin by preventing water loss, work as humectants,  definetly want these in your routine**\n\nbeeswax, olive oil, coconut oil and lanolin, petroleum jelly, mineral oil, glycerin, zinc oxide, butyl stearate and diglycol laurate , urea, glycerol, propylene glycol or lactic acid are big ones here.\n\nSome of these are termed 'comedogenic' like coconut oil but many many people don't break out from them so that's a pretty arbitrary rating imo\n\n**Edit- here’s a couple more I forgot to add that are sunscreen relevant**\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate-** protects against UVB and not UVA rays. It is not very stable either, when exposed to sunlight, it kind of breaks down and loses its effectiveness (not instantly, but over time - it loses 10% of its SPF protection ability within 35 mins)\n\n**Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane-**  famous Avobenzone. It is the only globally available chemical sunscreen agent that protects against UVA. It is the global gold standard of UVA protection and is the most used UVA sunscreen in the world. Suprisingly it’s in moisturizers too.The problem with it, though, is that it is not photostable and degrades in the sunlight. Wikipedia says that avobenzone loses 36% of its UV-absorption capacity after just one hour of sunlight",

    "body": "Balsamic vinegar is something that garners a lot of interest from people all over the world and it gets a bit confusing so I figured it would be useful to write a guide to hopefully clear up a bit of confusion for those who are interested in learning more about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCLOSURE: I own a business importing balsamic vinegar to the US. I'm going to avoid mentioning anything about my business in particular because I'm not trying to promote my business. I started it because I became very passionate about this topic after trying the real thing in Italy and I thought it would be nice to share some of what I have learned.\n\nIf I'm able to help someone who was like me looking for the real thing then my mission is accomplished. I think there's a lot of confusion in this industry coming as a result of misleading marketing and opaque processes. I hope that this makes things a bit easier but if you have any questions I'll do my best to help however possible!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief history of balsamic vinegar**\n\nBalsamic vinegar's history dates back centuries in two small regions in Italy (Modena and Reggio Emilia). When a couple was married they were offered a barrel of balsamic vinegar by the bride's family almost as a type of dowry. The couple would then allow that barrel to age over several years and eventually they would have a small treasure sitting in their attic. (NOTE: I have seen a few different variations of this story in circulation but this is how the story was told to me by a vinegar house owner in the region)\n\nWhen balsamic vinegar rose in popularity in the US the practice of aging balsamic vinegars for 12, 20, or even 30+ years could not keep up with the demand.\n\nVinegar houses began to seek out ways to make balsamic vinegar on a large scale with faster turn around times. This lead to the modern practice of flavoring wine vinegar to sort of mimic the characteristics of the real thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Understanding the different options**\n\nAs I mentioned before, the vast majority of balsamic vinegar seen today is really just flavored wine vinegar. If you check the ingredients on pretty much any bottle you find at the grocery store you will see \"wine vinegar\" as the main ingredient or if it's a flavored variety the main ingredient will often be \"balsamic vinegar\" for ex. [fig flavored balsamic](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jAOjcjtkL._SL1000_.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis does not mean that the beloved bottle in your pantry that you use frequently for salads, marinades, or to cook with is not useful. I personally use Kirkland's baslamic vinegar frequently for these purposes. However for those who are interested in learning more about authentic balsamic vinegar I think it's important to first clarify what the majority of balsamic vinegar in the US really is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Authentic balsamic vinegar is very different.**\n\nFirst, I think it's important to understand what's so different about it. It's made from the grape must of grapes grown in those two regions that I mentioned previously (Modena and Reggio Emilia). In a brief overview, the must is cooked and then placed in barrels of decreasing size over time. It's aged for a minimum of 12 years as opposed to the industrialized version which can be aged for as little as 60 days.\n\nIt's thicker than its industrialized counterpart due to the fact that the water content evaporates over time. (NOTE: You can find glazes made with wine vinegar that are just as thick or even thicker because the water content is boiled off and sometimes thickening agents are added ex. [xanthan gum](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RfO7UzoHL._SL1500_.jpg))\n\nAuthentic balsamic vinegar is often a bit sweeter than balsamic vinegar made using wine vinegar.\n\nMost importantly the acidity and sweetness of it are very balanced and it has a complexity from the grapes and wood barrels that is lost in the rushed industrialized proccess.\n\nI feel like the term balanced can be used very loosely without meaning anything specific. I've found that the best way to convey this difference is by the fact that I genuinely love authentic balsamic vinegar off of a tasting spoon.\n\nThe acidity is not harsh but flows naturally with the sweetness of the vinegar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When would you use this?**\n\nI think one of the most important things to know before purchasing authentic balsamic vinegar is knowing a bit about how to use it. It's very different from the industrialized version. However, the last thing I want is for that to come off as intimidating. Honestly, I'm not a great cook and I love balsamic vinegar because it shines with simpilicity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt can go with some more complex dishes, but it doesn't have to. The majoirty of the things that I use it with are very basic and it's just a matter of cutting and pouring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat it pairs best with it going to depend a bit on the specific vinegar you purchase and I strongly recommend looking at what the vinegar house that makes it recommends.\n\nOverall there are certain things it will generally go great with - fruit, cheese (younger cheese = use younger vinegar & older cheese = use older vinegar), meat (cooked or cured), fish, ice cream, rice.\n\nI say generally because if you're being particularly specific there are some nuances to this depending on the particular vinegar that you have. Don't overthink this too much it shouldn't be something that discourages you but moreso informs you of the differences between the variety of authentic balsamic vinegars available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where can you find it?**\n\nThis is where it can get tough if you're not willing to spend the money. There are two categories of what I would consider \"authentic\" balsamic vinegar. Those that are certified as DOP/PDO and those that are not.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how important terminology is when discussing this topic.\n\n**DOP/PDO**\n\nIn this category you have \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\" and \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia\". This is what will often be referred to as the best of the best. These products and their names are legally protected. Products bearing these names must be approved by a consortium that maintains strict control to ensure that every bottle bearing this name and certification meets their standard ([picture of seal](https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/8/what-is-dop-cert-ddop.jpg)). The consoritum controls the actual bottle design for balsamic vinegars bearing the certification (with different labeling depending on the vinegar house that made it).\n\nOn the left is the bottle used in Reggio Emilia & on the right is Modena's. ([Picture of bottles used](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Traditional_Balsamic_Vinegars_of_Modena_%28right%29_and_Reggio_Emilia_%28left%29.jpg/440px-Traditional_Balsamic_Vinegars_of_Modena_%28right%29_and_Reggio_Emilia_%28left%29.jpg))\n\nThe length of time that the vinegar is aged is shown by the color of the seal used\n\n**Reggio Emilia**\n\nRed = 12 years or more\n\nSilver = 18 years or more\n\nGold = 25 years or more\n\n**Modena**\n\nWhite = 12 years or more\n\nGold = 25 years or more\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the US, I've seen DOP bottles sold in Italian specialty stores and online. On Amazon a bottle of Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena aged 12 years will cost around $100 for 100mL (bottle size for DOP is always 100mL - yes it seems small but a little bit goes a long way). Extravecchio or aged for at least 25 years starts at around $180 for 100mL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE:\n\nThese are the cheapest prices that I saw when I last checked and the DOP seal essentially guarantees the quality when it was made I highly encourage read the seller's reviews before you purchase.\n\nIt's a small niche market and unfortunately sometimes people take advantage of the fact that it's such a mess by selling products that are spoiled becuase of inadequate handling or are in some other way defective. I don't mean to say this as if it's common or you're likely to be scammed however if you're paying $180 for a bottle of balsamic vinegar you want to take a moment to read the reviews and make sure you're getting what you paid for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Non-DOP**\n\nThis is where things get tricky. You're stepping outside of what has been certified by the consortium and you really have to depend upon your own research.\n\nThis can be good or bad. There are a number of reasons why a vinegar house chooses not to work with the consortium. For a vinegar house, working with the consoritum involves monetary costs, and sacrificing control over your business from everything to labeling to how it's made. Each vinegar house has to make the decision as to whether or not this is best for them.\n\nThere are some really incredible products that do not work with the constorium and there are some that are not it really just depends on the vinegar house. The consortium control the term \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale\" for their respective regions so you will not this term on bottles are not certified by them.\n\nI won't go to into the specifics mainly because it's so open ended but if you're going this route I think there's a few things that should be addressed.\n\nNon-DOP doesn't neccesarily mean cheaper. For example this bottle [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01E02WC5Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_ZYRTHK4P7P7G95S0JRZ4) is aged for 50 years (please don't shoot me if you decide order this and it's not up your expectations. I have never tried it. I'm only using it to illustrate my point). The constorium does not have a designation for a product aged for 50 years so I'd imagine the vinegar house decided it wouldn't make sense to be limited in presentation and production methods when it would just end up being grouped into products aged for 25+ years.\n\nSince you're doing your own research here's what I would recommend doing.Researching the vinegar house, reading reviews, and tasting it if possible (but this option is probably very unlikely).\n\nNot all non-DOP products are aged for 50 years. You just want to make sure that you're at least looking for ones aged for 12+ years. You should check the ingredients and make sure that it is only made with grape must. Lastly, I've seen a lot of stores that appear to casually sell baslamic vinegar aged in Modena or Reggio Emilia for 12 or 20+ years.\n\nThe best way to kind of filter through these is by tasting but if you've never had authentic balsamic vinegar before my best advice if it's too good to be true.. it's probably not what you're looking for.\n\nI mean I wish authentic baslamic vinegar was so easy to make that bottles could come in 250mL or 500mL sizes but to be honest with you that's never happened before (at least in my experience). In the US, I would expect to pay an absolute minimum of $30 for a 50mL bottle from what I've seen (since it's not regulated by the consortium some vinegar houses will make smalle bottles 40 or 50mL for example).\n\nThere's a quick couple things I would like to clarify as well and I think will clear up a lot of confusion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flavored Balsamic**\n\nPeople love it. I get it. However I can pretty much guarantee that any flavored balsamic vinegar is made from wine vinegar. I've yet to be proven otherwise. This isn't a bad thing I mean if you enjoy it then that's great. I'm sure there are plenty of great salad dressings where stuff like this makes sense to use.\n\nHowever, if you walk into a store and they're trying to sell you raspberry flavored balsamic vinegar from Modena that's aged for 20 years I'd be very suspicious of their claims.\n\nI don't know exactly what's going on there. Maybe they're taking balsamic vinegar that was aged for 20 years and essentially cutting it (I really hope not. It would be an absolute tragedy to treat such a difficult product to make like that if you ask me).\n\nMaybe they're using grapes that aren't from the region and it's just aged in Modena.\n\nOr I think most likely is the sad reality that they're either lying or are being lied to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Labeling**\n\nI mentioned before that the terms \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\" & \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia\" are legally protected. If something bears this term exactly as I've written it and the seal certifying that it's DOP/PDO you're pretty much guaranteed that it's of high quality as it's strictly controlled by the consotrium in the region.\n\nHowever, it would be a disservice to just kind of skip over the fact that there so many terms that surround balsamic vinegar that are not in any way controlled and it become very misleading.\n\nIf you asked anyone who's knowledgable in this industry - \"What is traditional balsamic vinegar?\", they would know you're talking about \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\" or \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia\". If you google \"traditional balsamic vinegar\" you will most likely find what you're looking for.\n\nHowever this term is not controlled. Traditional, authentic, genuine, real, etc. are all used frequently but do not in anyway certify whether the product is made with wine vinegar or \"traditional methods\".\n\nThat's not to say that you should entirely avoid any products that use these terms. It's really the only way to brand yourself as \"authentic\" when the product is not DOP. It's just important to understand that these terms have little weight and if you're looking to buy an \"authentic\" balsamic vinegar that is not DOP I'd recommend looking at the non-DOP section written previously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IGP/PGI**\n\nYay another certification to worry about!\n\nBasically this certification controls the term \"Aceto Balsamico di Modena\".\n\nI'm not going to go into the specifics of the IGP/PGI certification however this certification **guarantees very little** if you're looking for the real deal. The vast majority of these products are made using the industrialized methods that we discussed earlier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that covers the majority of it? I could go more into the grapes or the barrels used but this is already a bit long. Again if you have any questions about anything I'm happy to help however I can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nThere are a lot of baslamic vinegars out there. The majority of it is made with wine vinegar. This isn't really a bad thing it's just a different product that is used differently from what I would refer to as authentic balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you're looking for authentic balsamic vineger.. know what you're buying (start by checking the ingredients). For the average consumer it's easiest to go with a bottle that is certified DOP/PDO \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena\" or \"di Reggio Emilia\". There are some great balsamic vinegars that are not DOP/PDO however you have to do your own research diligently to know what you're buying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: One of the things that's really difficult about balsamic vinegar is the terminology. I try to be very careful about what words I use to describe certain things. For example, in my opinion, a balsamic vinegar should be certified DOP/PDO \"Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale\" for it to be considered \"traditional\".  Merely to prevent any further confusion surrounding these terms.\n\nHowever at the same time there are vinegar houses that have been doing this since the 1800's using the same methods that their ancestors 5 generations back used but are not DOP. I would hate to in any way discredit their work. This is the reason why I often use authentic for those that fall into this class.\n\nSo for clarification when I say authentic, it may not be DOP/PDO however it has been produced using traditional methods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  \n\nSince so many people have been asking for recommendations I feel like I’m doing a disservice by not including any \n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list but it’s just a starting point for those who have never bought anything like this before to go off of. (If you're in the US)\n\n**DOP** \n\n**Amazon** \n\n(I haven’t purchased these however they are DOP. I advise anyone to do their own research as far as reviews but I think these are very likely to be great options)\n\nBalsamic Guy x Villa Ronzan - 12yr $100 (This one’s reviews are mixed but the majority are solid. I'd like to see one with less negative reviews but I couldn't find any better option on amazon for a 12yr)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZGPEN3Y/ref=cm\\_sw\\_em\\_r\\_mt\\_dp\\_991XTC7K8Y19SETG5NRC?\\_encoding=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZGPEN3Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_991XTC7K8Y19SETG5NRC?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)\n\nAlma Gourmet Store x Villa Ronzan - 25yr $125 \n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081ZF9FPT/ref=cm\\_sw\\_r\\_cp\\_apa\\_glt\\_fabc\\_G23RTES4GP1M2MTBCQZD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081ZF9FPT/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_glt_fabc_G23RTES4GP1M2MTBCQZD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oliveoil4life**\n\n(The owner of this shop actually reached out to me recently and he seems like a great guy. He has a physical location, distributes to a number of stores, and sells online. He also sells DOP olive oil which is worth checking out)\n\nSapore - 12yr $79 + Shipping\n\n[https://www.oliveoil4life.com/product-page/affinato-12-years-old-3-5-fl-oz-100ml](https://www.oliveoil4life.com/product-page/affinato-12-years-old-3-5-fl-oz-100ml)\n\nSapore - 20yr $135 + Shipping\n\n[https://www.oliveoil4life.com/product-page/extravecchio-25-yrs-old-3-5-fl-oz-100ml](https://www.oliveoil4life.com/product-page/extravecchio-25-yrs-old-3-5-fl-oz-100ml)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Williams Sonoma**\n\nI've seen some other options that, if my memory serves me well, were sold here a bit cheaper so it's worth exploring and seeing if they have any other DOP options. However here's what they have online right now\n\nBona Furtuna - 12yr $120\n\n[https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/bona-furtuna-12-year-aged-tradizionale-balsamic-vinegar/](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/bona-furtuna-12-year-aged-tradizionale-balsamic-vinegar/)\n\nBona Fortuna - 25yr $200 \n\n[https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/bona-furtuna-25-year-aged-tradizionale-balsamic-vinegar/](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/bona-furtuna-25-year-aged-tradizionale-balsamic-vinegar/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Authentic but not DOP** \n\nThis category is a lot more difficult because finding an authentic balsamic vinegar that isn’t DOP in the US is very rare. \n\nFor example something like this would probably sell for like 60 euros in Italy if I had to guess based on what I paid in the past for their products but on Amazon US it’s listed for $150 (more than a DOP bottle)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O61B4Y/ref=cm\\_sw\\_em\\_r\\_mt\\_dp\\_GT39JQ8GCPS2F1Z0SRPY](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000O61B4Y/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_GT39JQ8GCPS2F1Z0SRPY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really wish I had more options that I could recommend in this category but many are pretty expensive. The prices are similar enough to a DOP bottle that I think you'd just be better off going with a DOP option. \n\nHowever I know there are a lot of people looking for an option that’s a bit more affordable because it’s not DOP and isn’t made with wine vinegar. \n\nThe lack of options here is unfortunate and it’s exactly why I started my business with the desire of making something in this category available in the US.\n\nThe website is [truebalsamic.com](http://truebalsamic.com/)\n\nMy intention in sharing the link to my site isn’t to self promote but give pretty much the only option I trust in this category. Generally I always recommend going with a DOP bottle however I chose the vinegar house that I work with because I really believe the quality is very similar if not better than some of the DOP bottles I've tried (I will admit I'm probably biased)\n\nThere are a lot more options when you’re shopping for “aceto balsamico tradizionale” as opposed to non-DOP balsamic vinegar that doesn’t use wine vinegar. So honestly it's really a choice that just depends on what you're looking for. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any other thoughts on stuff on links I should include please let me know! I really wish I could add some more to the authentic but not DOP list. ",

        "body": "I told this story before but I once had some pretty damn expensive Balsamic Vinegar and it was pretty surprising.  Long, funny story if anyone cares to entertain themselves, if not, just skip me, not important.\n\nI worked at a huge wine & spirits warehouse and one of the other Managers was older than me but a local guy, grew up in that town, etc.  He would go to a very awesome Italian, gourmet, deli-kind-of-place (it was like a Deli-looking place that made restaurant-quality food...) for lunch and they always just made different stuff to go each day and he'd pick whatever he wanted and if others (like me) wanted something he'd get something random.  It was *always good* , even stuff I wouldn't think I'd like.  I mean from gourmet sandwiches to salmon to spaghetti to whatever.  Awesome.  Not inexpensive... you know, $10+ minimum for a very fancy sandwich when there were Five Dollar Footlongs all day long etc.  \n\nFinally one day after I've worked there for months and months, he goes, \"Wanna come today??\" - Yeah, I've been wanting and waiting but didn't want to say.  Finally he asks & takes me and the place was in a huge strip mall complex, nondescript really - introduces me to the owner, \"This is the one I've told you about...\" and the Italian guy owner starts showing off his stuffs, including gourmet to-go stuff ... I am taking the hint he wants me to buy something, so I go look around, grab a random bottle of probably $20-something Balsamic vinegar (I mean it was either fancy Olive Oil or fancy Balsamic Vinegar or stuff I wouldn't understand...) $20 is not exactly cheap... and then this fucking guy just gets hilariously dramatic on us...conspiratorial, low, important voice...\n\n...\"Jason [coworker]... I've known you a very long time... how well do you know this kid...\"\n\n\"Well I mean we're coworkers... been a few months... right?  Half a year, 3/4 or more?\"\n\n\"Do you *really* know him??\"\n\n\"Not really , no...\" (quite honest answer...)\n\n\"Is he a TRUE FRIEND of yours??\" <what the fuck is with this guy's dramatization here...>\n\n\"Uhhh.... I mean... he's alright...\"\n\n\"Do you vouch for him??\"\n\n\"I mean... uhh... he's cool... I guess...\"\n\n\"I need to know if you can TRUST him...\"  (with vinegar, now??)\n\n<meanwhile me and the coworker are both looking at each other like, 'Get a load of this shit...'>\n\n\"Again, he's ok...\"\n\n\"Well... if you vouch for him, and he's a very important person in your life... <just loool> ... you don't want to buy that one... put it back and pick up the one on the top shelf, to the right... no not that one, THAT one...\"\n\n$150 bottle.  I mean come the fuck on now.   I see the tag and immediately , \"Sir thank you so much, but this is way out of my price range...\" \n\n\"I understand but it's a masterpiece... it's the only one you'd want if you're giving as a gift.....I can let you have it for... oh I don't know... about $75...\"  Coworker just shakes his head, pretty much thinking in his mind a combination of 'I'm sorry I got you into this bro...' and \"*THIS* is why I come alone....\"\n\nI am the type that loves to argue in certain situations and shrinks away into a \"just be polite and it will be all over soon\" so I am then taking out my debit card and wondering what the fuck I am going to do with a bottle of Super Second Growth-Bordeaux level priced Balsamic Vinegar and I LIKE THE NORMAL RED KIND ANYWAY!!!\n\nDon't you know, after ringing it up, going to pack our food up, he then says, \"Here, let me show you how amazing real aged Italian Balsamic Vinegar can be...\" <This stuff was more than 25 years old, because I was actually 26 at the time, and it was older than I was, but I can't remember what it exactly was etc.> - He grabs a block of imported Italian Parmiggiano-Reggiano, shaves a couple a few pieces off, *opens my fucking bottle*, and *DRAMATICALLY* pours little dribbles on the cheese for us to sample, only allowing the cork stopper to be partially exposed to only allow tiny drops to emerge..  So now it's a Used bottle.\n\nAnd yeah, it was pretty damn good, surprising, I guess like someone having very high quality wine for the first time, you didn't realize stuff could be like that.\n\nIn the end, it wound up in my families cabinet and they'd just grab it, pour some on their salads etc. and that was that.

    "body": "I just returned from a 26-day trip to France, and for the first time in a long time, I felt amazing—no bloating, totally regular bowel movements, no discomfort, and steady energy. And this was despite eating more bread, cheese, wine, and full meals than I ever do at home.\n\n**A typical day in France looked like this:**\n\n• **Morning:** A café crème and a croissant split between us\n\n• **Lunch:** After a mile or two of walking, we’d sit down for a full meal—always with bread, wine, and usually three courses\n\n• **Afternoon:** Easily walked 5+ miles without even thinking about it\n\n• **Dinner (around 9pm):** More wine (we’d split 2–3 bottles among three people), more bread, full entrée, and dessert\n\n• I was probably drinking 6 to 8 glasses of wine a day—and never once felt bloated, sluggish, or uncomfortable.\n\nWhat I’m trying to understand...Is it the food quality in France? Are European ingredients and thus genuinely easier on the gut? Additives like xanthan gum? I realized the last 4 packaged foods I ate back home all had xanthan gum. Could that, or other common U.S. additives (like corn syrup or gums), be the culprit? Or it it just stress, which I had little of while traveling...",

You'd be better to introduce a couple of short (20 minute) HIIT sessions first thing in the morning.\n\nAlso in the second picture your posture doesn't look as good to me - if you look at your shoulders they seem to be rolled forward noticeably more. Make sure you are adding things like inverse rows (Australian pull ups) - where you're holding a low bar, lying flat-ish on your back and pulling up. Be sure to really pull your shoulder blades together at the top, and at the bottom keep the strength through your scaps and don't sag down. The same when you're doing pull ups.\n\nTry and move away from chin ups to pull ups - they will put more emphasis on your back muscles. \n\nAlso things like the superman will help - [https://greatist.com/health/superman-exercise#how-to-do-the-superman](https://greatist.com/health/superman-exercise#how-to-do-the-superman)\n\nIt's tempting to do loads of pushing and abs as it's easier and you see improvements in the mirror, but it's a dangerous combination because all it really does it tightens the front side of your body, pulling you into a hunched position. This is exacerbated by the fact most of us spent a lot of time sitting.\n\nFinally don't worry about protein too much, as long as you're eating well and getting enough from other sources. Time under tension and consistency getting that are what will make your muscles grow.\n\nHope this helps a bit :)",

    "body": "I've been trying recipes for the last couple of weeks, unhappy with the recipes I could find online. So I finally landed on this after making a ton of adjustments. \n\nCrust, based off loopywhisk recipe, with adjustments\n\n* 188g superfine white rice flour\n* 113g potato starch\n* 74g cornstarch\n* 1 tsp granulated sugar\n* 1 ½ tsp xanthan gum\n* ½ tsp kosher salt\n* 250 g (2 sticks + 2 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into ½ inch (1cm) cubes, chilled\n* 150 g (½ cup + 2 tbsp) cold water\n\n* In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour blend, sugar, xanthan gum and salt.\n\n* Add the cold cubed butter and toss it in the flour until each piece is coated.\n\n* Squish each cube of butter between your fingers to form small, thin sheets of butter. Once you’ve squished all the butter pieces, toss them again with the flour to ensure that they’re evenly distributed. Be sure to check that you’ve squished all the butter pieces before adding the water.\n\n* Add the cold water and mix well with a fork or rubber spatula until the dough starts coming together. After you’ve added all the water, the dough will still look very dry – don’t be tempted to add more.\n\n* Gently squeeze and knead the dough, pressing it against the sides of the bowl, until it comes together in a shaggy ball with little-to-no dry patches (this can take up to 5 minutes). If absolutely necessary, and if after 5 minutes the dough still hasn’t come together, sprinkle a tiny amount of water on the most persistent dry patches.\nThe final dough should hold together in a ball but will not look perfectly smooth or evenly hydrated. That’s perfectly fine, the flour in the dough will hydrate more evenly during the next refrigeration step.\n\n* Chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until the pie dough feels firm but not hard when you press down on it with your finger.\n\n* Tap on the chilled pie dough rectangle (along its length) with a rolling pin to make it more pliable.\nRoll it out into an approximately 6x18 inch (15x45cm) rectangle (no need to be super precise about it). Turn the dough so that a short end is closest to you. Brush off any excess flour and fold the dough as you would an A4 letter – the top third down towards the middle and the bottom third up over it. This is called a \"letter fold\".\n\n* Rotate the dough by 90 degrees (so that the open ends are closest and farthest from you). Roll out into a similar-sized rectangle and repeat the letter fold. For best results, complete a total of 4-6 letter folds (the more you do, the greater the flakiness). If the dough becomes too soft at any point, chill it in the fridge for 15-30 minutes before proceeding.\n\n* After the final letter fold, wrap the dough in cling film and chill it for at least 30 minutes or until needed. (If you chill it for longer than 1 hour before using, soften it for about 15-30 minutes at room temperature, so that it’s pliable.)\n\n* Preheat oven to 425. Roll out your dough onto a floured parchment sheet, rolling to 3mm thick.\n\n* Flip the dough into your pie pan and crimp your edges as you see fit. This dough is almost a puff pastry so keep this in mind, it will fluff up. \n\n* Dock you bottom and sides of the crust generously. Chill for 30 minutes in freezer. While this is chilling, place a sheet pan in your oven to get hot.\n\n* Once your crust is done chilling, place a parchment round and some pie weights or beans in the pie. \n\n* Place pie in oven and set your timer for 10 minutes. During this time, beat an egg for an egg wash\n\n* Take the pie from the oven, remove the weights and parchment. Generously brush down the entire crust with you4 egg wash, ensuring every bit is coated. This will keep your crust from getting soggy later. \n\n* Put the crust back into the oven, set the timer for 10 minutes, and watch for the bottom of the crust to be cooked through, and the edges are just starting to become golden. Remove crust from oven and cool. \n\nFilling recipe in comments",

Morton kosher salt\n* ½ tsp. ground ginger\n* ¼ tsp. ground cloves\n* ¼ tsp. ground fresh nutmeg\n* 1 tbsp. Gluten free all purpose flour\n* 2 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks room temperature, beaten to blend\n* 2 cups unsweetened pumpkin purée\n* ⅔ cup sweetened condensed milk\n* ⅓ cup heavy cream\n* Seeds from 1 vanilla bean or tsp. vanilla extract\n\n* \nPreheat oven to 325°. \n* Whisk ⅓ cup (67 g) sugar, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, ½ tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. ground cloves, and ¼ tsp. ground nutmeg in a large bowl until no clumps remain. \n* Add 2 large eggs plus 2 large egg yolks, room temperature, beaten to blend, 2 cups unsweetened pumpkin purée, ⅔ cup sweetened condensed milk, ⅓ cup heavy cream, and vanilla bean seeds or 2 tsp. vanilla extract and whisk until smooth. \n* Pour into cooled crust. Bake pie until edges are set and slightly puffed but center is recessed and wobbles like Jell-O, 60–75 minutes (it will continue to set after baking). Transfer to a wire rack and let cool at least 3 hours before slicing.\n\nIf you are lactose intolerant, I also made a version of this where the heavy cream is full fat coconut milk, and the sweetened condensed milk is just sweetened condensed coconut milk.",

Has \"great skin moisturising properties\" according to [Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dipropylene-glycol). Safety rating of 1-2 (very safe) on [Cosdna](https://www.cosdna.com/eng/b05d771602.html). This is likely nothing to worry about unless you already know you have a sensitivity, as it is mostly there to keep the formula feeling elegant and seems to be mildly hydrating. \n\n//\n\nHYALURONIC ACID FERMENT FILTRATE \n\nNew kind of hyaluronic acid that Hada Labo claims will \"help fortify the skins moisture barrier to help skin looking plump and supple\". This is the most controversial addition as many people are sensitive to ferments and this product will unfortunately now be unsuitable for them, which is a real shame. However, if you are someone who enjoys ferments, this might sound rather exciting. I couldn't find much info when I searched \"fermented hyaluronic acid\", but Ratzilla's list seems to suggest that the HA has been fermented with Lactococcus bacteria, which is proposed to \"positively influence both the speed and quality of epidermal growth, resulting in better barrier function and overall skin quality\" ([Incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactococcus-ferment-lysate)). I'm not convinced a difference in effect will be extremely noticeable alongside the 6 other kinds of HA but I expect it will work well for plumping and improving the health and appearance of the skin regardless. \n\n//\n\nHYDROLIZED SODIUM HYALURONATE \n\nThis is a super, super tiny (low molecular weight) version of hyaluronic acid, which is intended to penetrate even deeper into the skin and moisturise deeper than standard HA. If your skin wasn't bothered by the Hydrolized hyaluronic acid (another smaller molecule form) in the original formula (still in this one too!) then you might well not be bothered by this version too. Source: [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-sodium-hyaluronate)\n\n//\n\nPROPANEDIOL \n\nCommonly used solvent, humectant and emollient. In short, makes formulas more cosmetically elegant and also helps to pull moisture into the skin and keep it there. Considered very safe and a non-irritant. Further reading: [byrdie article](https://www.byrdie.com/propanediol-for-skin-4773491) [paula's choice ](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/uncategorized/propanediol.html)\n\n//\n\nCAPRYLHYDROXAMIC ACID \n\nAn anti-fungal amino acid derived from coconut oil that acts as a preservative. Limited data regarding safety, but Honest Beauty claims it is safer and less harsh than other commonly used preservatives (take this with a grain of salt as Honest Beauty has an agenda to push and so will be biased). Sources: [truth in ageing ](https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/caprylhydroxamic-acid)\n[honest beauty ](https://www.honest.com/blog/wellness/ingredients/what-is-caprylhydroxamic-acid/13775.html)\n\n//\n\nHYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE \n\nUsed as a thickener in cosmetics, gives a nice slippy, gel-like feeling. Water soluble, regarded as safe. \n\n//\n\nXANTHAN GUM \n\nExtremely commonly used thickener and stabiliser. Unlikely to be an issue unless you have a specific sensitivity to it. \n\n\n//\n\nAnd now, let's look at the changes in the top few ingredients: \n\n• The top ingredients, which I usually regard as the most important, have changed in that normal Glycerin has been removed and replaced with Diglycerin, and it's now the 7th ingredient as opposed to the 3rd. Diglycerin is not much different as both are powerful hydrators, but Diglycerin supposedly \"penetrates slower into the skin but gives longer lasting moisture and less sticky, better skin-feel.\" Source: [incidecoder ](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/diglycerin) This might be good for people who have tried the original Premium and found it to be too sticky on the skin! However, due to it being moved lower down, the impact might not be too obvious here. \n\n• Pentylene Glycol has been bumped way up the list from 16th to 4th! This is another thickening ingredient that is key to the sensory feeling of the product, and according to incidecoder its also a moisturiser and helps to hydrate and smooth the skin. However, [the derm review ](https://thedermreview.com/pentylene-glycol/) actually claims it doesn't have any specific skin benefits, but is at least safe and non-irritating. I personally would rather have kept a higher concentration of glycerin or diglycerin in the product as opposed to this as I think they're more intensely moisturising/hydrating to the skin. \n\n• On the other hand, urea has been moved from the 5th ingredient to the 3rd, where glycerin was previously. From [incidecoder](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea): \"A derivative of Urea, that works as a strong moisturizer and humectant meaning that it helps the skin to cling onto water and thus to make it hydrated and elastic.\n\nAccording to manufacturer's data,  Hydroxyethyl Urea has a similar moisturizing ability to glycerin (measured at 5%), but it feels nicer on the skin as it is non-sticky and non-tacky and gives a lubricous and moist feeling to the skin.\" \n\nSo, perhaps this formulation could actually remain equally as hydrating, if not more so, but less sticky due to the removal of glycerin? \n\n//\n\nTLDR: \n\nSo, apart from the ferment all the new additions are commonly used ingredients - nothing toxic, irritating or comodegenic! In theory (best case scenario) it should be even more hydrating due to the extra two forms of hyaluronic acid, and potentially less sticky due to the removal of glycerin and higher concentrations of urea and Diglycerin! Worst case scenario is that the concentrations of HA have been lowered and it won't have the same deeply plumping effect, only time will tell. \n\nThis is getting very long and my thumbs are tired so I'm going to end this post here even though I could potentially go on, hopefully this helps some people make an informed decision on whether they'd like to try the new formulation. I personally have already ordered a bottle as I'm not concerned by the addition of ferments and in general it doesn't look bad at all. Fingers crossed it's somehow even better than the original!!",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use. I'm also using HA (unrelated to this post) but I think due to my dehydrated skin, it's becoming even more dehydrated. I will try TO's Mandelic and maybe alternate it with Pixi day to day.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "I know CeraVe in the tub is quite popular here, but I just wanted to provide a quick overview of other CeraVe moisturizers for those who aren't familiar.\n\n**NOTE**: All CeraVe moisturizers contain cetearyl alcohol/cetyl alcohol, which may cause breakouts to those who have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols.\n\n**Cerave Moisturizer Overview**\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) (also known as Cerave \"in the tub\") is a thick, creamy moisturizer with ceramides, hyaluronic acid and petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/moisturizing-lotion) comes in a bottle and is a thinner consistency. It also has ceramides and hyaluronic acid but no petrolatum.\n\n[**Cerave AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/am-facial-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a small pump bottle and has a thick, creamy (slightly greasy) texture. It is SPF 30 and contains the following active suncare ingredients: Homosalate (12% - for UVB protection), Octinoxate (7.5% - for UVB protection), Octocrylene (2% - for UVB protection), Zinc Oxide (3.5% - for UVA protection). It also contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/pm-facial-moisturizing-lotion) (my fave) comes in a small pump bottle and is a silky/gel texture. It contains niacinamide, ceramides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and places more focus on chemical exfoliation. Notable ingredients are mineral oil, ammonium lactate (similar to lactic acid), salicyclic acid, ceramides and a lower concentration of hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**Cerave Renewing SA Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/renewing-sa-cream) comes in a tub and is a thicker version of the SA lotion and contains similar ingredients with the addition of niacinamide.\n\n[**Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/moisturizers/skin-renewing-night-cream) comes in a tub and contains shea butter, ceramides, niacinamide, peptides and hyaluronic acid.\n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-lotion) comes in a pump bottle and contains niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and allantoin (an anti-irritant derived from urea). \n\n[**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**](http://www.cerave.com/our-products/baby/baby-moisturizing-cream) comes in a tub and contains glycerin, petrolatum, ceramides and hyaluronic acid. No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

A big pan makes 10 portions which is enough for both of us to have dinner all week.\n\nFor breakfast I make chewy keto friendly granola bars with almond butter and nuts and seeds. After they bake and cool I put them in snack sized bags and freeze them. \n\nFor snacks we have almonds already portioned out, lots of pickles, organic farmer's cheese, and raw cauliflower with wholly guacamole. \n\nOn the weekend I do like to try new recipes, but if I'm tired we always do omelettes with various fillings or fish.

I argued that as with ANY DIET there's simple recipes and more complicated recipes. When you eat \"normal\" you tend to keep it simple since you are aware you are not a multiaward winning chef, and somehow on Keto you think you have to complicate things??\n\nLuckily my wife, did not fall completely off the wagon, just a few cheat days or small breaks, nothing that would make her lose faith or put any weight back on. So now, she will do the occasionally cheesecake or fancy-dancy recipes if we have visitors or want to try something different, but for most of the time is healthy veg, good fats and meat. And often that is what we crave anyway.\n\nI think most people will want to try and complicate and in my opinion they should. Keto is no fad diet. \nOnce you realize that Keto is just our \"normal\" diet only healthier then everything becomes easy.\n\nOur friends keep asking for help, so we run a very small FB group and remind to keep it simple, focus on their own victories.",

It’s au jus? \n\nNo it’s Demi, but now it’s like turkey gravy. He looked at it and his brain just like broke, he paused and said… this is gravy…? I don’t understand. \n\nNo chef, it’s beef Demi. And explained everything. \n\nHe said am I being punked right now? Where are the cameras. \n\nWe went through the cooler and I showed him where I got it from and he just died laughing. He immediately said okay I understand what happened here. They made chicken stock for chicken Demi and put it in the veal Demi bucket for some reason, but failed to tell you that part. \n\nI don’t know if I’m incredibly stupid or if I made a reasonably ignorant mistake lol",

So often fact folk say they made an aioli which is really just a mayo... with or without garlic. I once had a barbecue aioli served at a more upscale bbq house... let’s be honest it was a barbecue favored mayo as a dipper... wasn’t bad although I’m not a bbq sauce fan. But it was bbq mayo sauce.\n\nSome recipes that claim to be traditional aioli use all sorts of stuff in it including eggs.... that’s mayo.\n\nUsing xanthan is actually a technique that producers of low fat mayos use to thicken as well as to give a “fatty feeling/sensation “ on the tongue but removing the egg fat and help cut down on the oil by using more liquid phase to make up the emulsion. If you don’t use anything that came from animal products or byproducts... it technically would be a vegan mayo. That does not by any means necessarily mean it’s “not good” or is “bad” it still would probably be better than most mayo off the shelf vegan or otherwise. You get to choose what you put in it and can make it as delightful as you want!\n\nPS yes the xanthan “replaced” the egg... it is used in molecular gastronomy techniques and is an emulsifier/stabilizer and thickener... it is used in a lot of sauces like hot sauce to give it body and keep the tiny bits of spices and finely blended particles from separating keeping them dispersed. A few “shake well”s and it all comes back together. Eggs contain lecithin which does similar things as a hydrocolloid agent. There is soy based lecithin which can also be used for vegan cooking instead of eggs.... and finally agar/“sodium alginate” can be used with things that contain sodium/potassium/and one other ionic salt that I forget at the moment to thicken things. In different combos you can whip up all sorts of fantastic things...\n\nYou accidentally did good chemistry.... congrats... just remember all cooking is edible chemistry... keep up the good work!\n\nLookup: Molecular Gastronomy; Faran Adria; hydrocolloids; el bulli",

I put them all together with a little over 2% salt by weight and vacuum bagged them. It was an eclectic mix of peppers: bells, jalapeños, fresnos, cayennes, serranos, habaneros, anaheims, whatever was around. \n\nAfter fermenting for a few days, it inflated to the point of needing urgent venting. To my surprise, it fully inflated again, needing venting. Then it inflated again! If you look you can see that the last one isn’t very fully inflated. At this point I needed some time to process. \n\nYesterday I had that time. I also opened two other bags sitting on the counter for a couple months. The cayennes were fairly recent but my habanero bag was pretty old. It had really broken down the cells and was very liquid. And pretty funky. At first I thought it had gone bad, but then I realized it was funk. A bit much for me, but I blended it in anyway. \n\nFor blending, I did that in batches and still over filled my 8-cup measuring cup. \n\nI then strained it all through a sieve with a spoon and mixed it up to blend the flavors. I added about 1.5 tsp of Xanthan gum (bag said I should use 3 tsp for that volume if I was making salad dressing) to keep the liquids separating from the solids. \n\nAfter bottling, I ran out of time for the pulp. So today I added three limes worth of juice to make my own Tajin, and then spread it on the dehydrator on pieces of parchment paper to dry. The dehydrator goes outside so it doesn’t chili-up the house. \n\nShould be completely done in a couple days.",

Kanebo’s [brands](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.co.jp/products/brand) include, well, Kanebo, as well as Allie, Kate, and Suisai.\n\nThe Allie brand also has a [Facial Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-facial-gel-n-2020/)^(E) that’s specifically meant for the face, a [milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-perfect-n-2020/)^(E) that’s also for the face and body, and a few tone-up/color-correcting gels, all of which are rated SPF 50+ PA++++. (And a few water resistant makeup products that I admittedly tend to forget about.) They’re currently marketing their color-correcting sunscreens, [Allie Color Tuning UV](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-color-tuning-uv/),^(E) quite heavily as a foundation alternative that also provides UV protection. Aside from the Color Tuning line, which was released on February 16, 2021, all of the current sunscreens were released on February 16, 2020 (2020 formula). The previous version of the Allie gel, [Allie Extra UV Gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-spf50/)^(E) (without the “N”), was released on February 16, 2018 (2018 formula), and all the presently discontinued formulations released in 2018 and 2019 were also rated SPF 50+ PA++++.\n\nI’ve been using the Allie gel for nearly a decade now, starting with [the second formulation](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/allie-extra-uv-gel-mineral-moist-n/)^(E) released in 2012. [This 2013 article](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/japan-pa-system-for-uva-protection-revised/) from RatzillaCosme reminded me that I picked it up in the first place because it was one of the first sunscreens to be labelled PA++++. I do still try out other sunscreens from time to time, but I always have a tube of the Allie gel open concurrently with anything else I use. I’ve posted about the difference between the 2018 and 2020 formulas [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/gkgwm8/sunscreen_kanebo_allie_februaryapril_2020_new/), and reviews of each version [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/bz8r9t/japanese_sunscreens_allie_extra_uv_gel_highlight/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/jmkjlk/japanese_sunscreens_pt_2_allie_extra_uv_gel_n/), with an update to the 2020 review coming up.\n\n# On testing and reformulations\n\nAfter learning about the loophole in Korean law through [Odile Monod’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) (via u/bloominglace’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/)) and [Instagram Highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA0MjgzMTIwODUyNTQ4?story_media_id=2553999541407826596_1588058418) (via u/FrenchbunnyG’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mvajyp/korean_sunscreen_controversy_industry/gvbbsmz) in the same post), I tried to find information about the laws surrounding SPF/PA testing for reformulated products in Japan (because I live in Japan and therefore use Japanese sunscreens) but kept getting a bunch of hits about testing methods in general, and gave up trying to sift through it all.\n\nThe only product I personally really care about is the Allie gel, so I wrote to Kanebo directly and asked whether they test their reformulated products individually, with the 2018 and 2020 formulas of the Allie gel as an example, or whether their test results are carried over across formulations. Their response as of April 26, 2021 is that they test each version separately (“SPF/PA値の測定に関しまして、それぞれ測定しております”).\n\nI don’t know whether the same goes for all companies in Japan or not, or even for all Kao/Kanebo brands, but that’s one less thing for Allie users to worry about.\n\n*—And after leaving this sitting in my drafts for a couple of weeks, I am adding that* u/ysy_heart *has posted* [*this*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) *about what the director of Japan Cosmetic Industry Association said about what their guidelines are on this subject.*\n\n# Hong Kong Consumer Council (October 2020)\n\nIn [the October 2020 report by the Hong Kong Consumer Council](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/jj0n81/sun_care_test_report_of_30_sunscreen_products/)^(E/TC) that everyone keeps referring to, the 2018 formula of the Allie gel (as seen in [the photo](https://imgur.com/seDmooL) published with the report) was rated SPF 61.7 PPD 9.8 (PA+++).\n\n*I’ll post a simplified version of [the results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(E/TC) in the comments, mostly for my own convenience.

However, the current standard for SPF testing in Japan is [ISO 24444:2019](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24444:ed-2:v1:en),^(E) effective as of February 21, 2020 according to [this notice](https://www.jcia.org/user/common/download/business/guideline/spf/SPF-jcia-r020221.pdf)^(J) (linked from [this page](https://www.jcia.org/user/business/guideline/spf)^(J)) issued by the [Japan Cosmetic Industry Association](https://www.jcia.org/en/)^(E) (JCIA)—or maybe it was also accepted before then? JCIA isn’t a government organization, by the way, so I don’t think they can actually enforce anything, but they seem to be in charge of setting industry-wide guidelines and work directly with the government in some capacity. Anyway, the same notice states that ISO 24444:2019 was issued in December 2019. The major changes between the 2010 and 2019 versions are listed in the Foreword of ISO 24444:2019:\n\n>— The definition of the minimal erythema response (MED) criteria has been revised.  \n>\n>— The choice of eligible test subjects is now based solely on individual typology angle (ITA°) with a requirement for the average ITA° for the test panel to be within the range 41° to 55°, with a minimum of three subjects within two of the three ITA° ranges.  \n>\n>— The ITA° is used to define the range of unprotected MED doses for the provisional or the test day unprotected MED determination (if no provisional MEDu determination is made).  \n>\n>— Three new reference standard sunscreens have been validated and added to the method to validate SPF test panels for products with SPF equal to 25 or higher (P5, P6 and P8).  \n>\n>— New test methods are provided to determine the uniformity of the beam of both large and small beam size solar simulators. A requirement for uniformity greater than or equal to 90 % has been added.  \n>\n>— Sunscreen application procedures have been described in greater detail.  \n>\n>— An informative Annex F has been added with photographic examples of erythema responses with guidelines for grading.  \n>\n>— The reporting tables in Annex G) and the requirements in Clause 11 have modified to provide more complete information on the results of the testing.  \n>\n>— The bibliography has been updated.\n\nThe notice from JCIA also lists most of these changes, with a few additional details. They point out for example that the Fitzpatrick skin type is being phased out as criteria for test subjects in favor of individual typology angle (ITA°), which will be relevant later in this post.\n\n*If you have no idea what an “individual typology angle” is (like me), it’s strictly based on skin color and seems much less open to interpretation than the Fitzpatrick skin type criteria. I found* [*this 2013 review article*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.12529)*^(PDF)* *in the* British Journal of Dermatology *really informative, though I admittedly have only skimmed through it very quickly.*\n\nIt’s possible that Eurofins just hasn’t updated their website, but I think this is what Michelle Ma Chan Mok-lan (Fancl) is talking about in the quote above about the HKCC report using testing methods from 2010. [Fancl Sunguard 50+ Protect UV](https://www.fancl-hk.com/product_details.asp?item_id=5685),^(TC) their product in the report (rated SPF 50+ PA++++ and tested at SPF 14.3 PPD 6.8 or PA++), was apparently released in [2018](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/10153767/top)^(J) in Japan, but according to the *South China Morning Post* article, “\\[Ma Chan\\] said that its product went through two rounds of testing by Cantor Research Laboratories in the United States in 2019 and the Chongqing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in China in 2017.” (Fancl also seems to point out that their product needs to be shaken before use in [this article](https://beauty.ulifestyle.com.hk/beauty/skincare/20099/fancl防曬-對消委會測試報告表示失望-強調產品完全符合標示-消委會就事件最新回應),^(TC) which could indeed potentially be something that affected the test results. I feel like it’s common knowledge among anyone that’s familiar with milk sunscreens at all, though, and I would hope that any lab conducting these tests would be aware of this. They also seem to say in the same article that any sunscreens that had extremely different test results should be re-tested in more than one lab, which is fair. But keep in mind that I’m reading a machine-translated version of the article for these observations.)\n\nI’m going to ignore the test run in China in 2017 because I believe it would have been following the so-called outdated testing methods, or ISO 24444:2010 (see the section titled “The Chinese version” below). [Cantor Research Laboratories](http://www.cantorlabs.com) basically just has their contact information on the website, so I can’t tell whether they would have conducted their test according to ISO 24444:2019, which would have been possible if the test took place in December. Cantor Research Laboratories was composed of 15 employees and specialized in anti-aging claims [as of 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09419-cover). *(They apparently do testing for Amway, a major MLM company, by the way; try googling* `\"Cantor Research Laboratories\" Amway study`*. —No, I don’t know whether that actally means anything, it’s just something I noticed.)* Eurofins Scientific on the other hand is composed of approximately 50,000 employees in 800 laboratories in 50 countries ([source](https://www.eurofins.com)), though I don’t have numbers for the Australian location specifically. I don’t know whether larger labs would necessarily produce more accurate results, but I would assume they generally wouldn’t be likely to be *less* accurate (or am I completely mistaken?). Interestingly, Dermatest, an Australian lab that was acquired by Eurofins ([source](https://dermatest.com.au)), lists Cantor Research Laboratories among their “Scientific Associates” on [their Links page](https://dermatest.com.au/information/links/). They also cite Cantor Research Laboratories’ Operating Procedure Manual on what appears to be another one of their factsheets, “No. 28 Antiperspirant Efficacy,” published on p. 12 of the February 2017 issue of *The Science of Beauty* (vol. 6 no. 7; [PDF](https://ascc.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SOB-Feb2017.pdf)). On Eurofins’ Australian website, they instruct that samples should be sent to “Eurofins Dermatest,” located at the same address on the Dermatest website ([example](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/)), so I’m pretty sure we can think of them as the same entity. Clearly they know of Cantor Research Laboratories, and I wonder what they would say about the discrepancy.\n\nReturning to the *South China Morning Post* article, I assume that “the sampling of Australians for a product designed for Asians” is in reference to SPF testing, not PA testing, since the latter was *in vitro*. According to Eurofins’ [SPF Testing factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601368/spf-testing.pdf),^(PDF) their test subjects “consisted of fair skin individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II or III” (p. 3). As mentioned above, ISO 24444:2019 no longer uses Fitzpatrick skin types as criteria for test subjects, so I think we can establish that the SPF results in the report cannot be compared directly with any SPF ratings based on ISO 24444:2019. There are however multiple sunscreens that were released before 2020 and would have been based on ISO 24444:2010.\n\nSo referring back to ISO 24444:2010, according to [this PDF from some time before 2013](https://www.tes-h.co.jp/documents/SPFPFA.pdf)^(J)—but I’m not sure whether it’s after 2010—Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III were part of the criteria for SPF test subjects (and types II, III, and IV for UVAPF). This would definitely be before 2010, but [this paper](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sccj1979/26/3/26_3_207/_article/-char/ja/)^(E/J) published by JCIA in 1992 also specifies Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III for SPF testing. As discussed below, the same goes for China as of 2015. So it seems like the Eurofins test subjects and test subjects in Japan and China (before ISO 24444:2019) would have the same Fitzpatrick Skin types, but Dr. Dray suggests in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGwjKOHq02w) (“Can we trust sunscreen? Korean SPF controversies,” April 30, 2021) that test subjects in different regions are likely to be skewed toward different skin tones. This is just speculation, but maybe it’s possible that more of the test subjects in Japan and China could have been types II and III, for instance, and more of the test subjects for the HKCC report could have been types I and II. (I’m guessing that this is what Professor Cheung means when he says that “the Eurofins report unfairly ran the tests on an Australian audience \\[…\\] given the products tested by the Consumer Council were formulated for Asian skin.”) In that case, while we absolutely couldn’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report, perhaps the report’s SPF ratings could possibly be pertinent if you have type I skin. But again, this is entirely speculative.\n\n**PA testing:** The Australian Eurofins website seems to confirm that their UVA tests are performed *in vitro*. I’m assuming they follow the [ISO 24443:2012](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24443:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vitro*), since they have [a factsheet](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601373/iso-24443-in-vitro-uvapf.pdf)^(PDF) for that too, linked from [this page](https://www.eurofins.com.au/dermatest/sunscreen-testing/spf-tests-and-related/uva-tests/) on UVAPF testing. (ISO 24443:2012 is also mentioned at the bottom of [the report’s results table](https://imgur.com/fPhhBUm)^(TC) in footnotes 4 and 5, but I gave up on trying to figure out what it actually says.) In Japan, however, UVAPF testing is performed according to the [ISO 24442:2011](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:24442:ed-1:v1:en)^(E) protocol (*in vivo*). Eurofins themselves state in this factsheet that both the Japanese and Korean markets require *in vivo* testing, which they also point out is much more expensive than *in vitro* testing (p. 1). They also state that UVAPF ratings determined by these tests are considered **estimates** of Boots Star, FDA Broad Spectrum,\\* and JCIA UVAPF (= what most of us know as PA) ratings (p. 2).\n\n*\\* The FDA website says in vitro testing is accepted in accordance with* [*21 CFR 201.327(j)*](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b97fda59bb83d2742a276a215cdc115e&mc=true&node=se21.4.201_1327&rgn=div8)*, which I didn’t have the energy to actually read and am assuming is the same thing as Eurofins’ factsheet on* [*FDA Broad Spectrum Testing*](https://cdnmedia.eurofins.com/apac/media/601376/fda-broad-spectrum.pdf).*^(PDF)* *They say it’s based on ISO 24443:2012 but with “differing film thickness and pre-irradiation requirements” (p. 1).*\n\nIf the UVAPF testing for the HKCC report was indeed in accordance with ISO 24443:2012, I wouldn’t discredit the results entirely—but again, I’m not an expert. While we can’t say that the ratings for Asian sunscreens are “incorrect” or that the companies are “lying” based on the HKCC report (same as the SPF ratings), it seems to me that the PPD ratings they give in the report could potentially be used to make comparisons with sunscreens from other countries where UVAPF ratings are also determined in accordance with the *in vitro* ISO 24443:2012 protocol, or at least with other results within the same report (though we would still have to keep in mind that “results reported from a single test should not be deemed conclusive”). Eurofins’ own factsheet suggests that ISO 24443:2012 is accepted in Australia, New Zealand, and the EU, but I haven’t done any research to back this up, and we have already seen that their factsheets might be outdated.\n\nThe next versions of [ISO 24442](https://www.iso.org/standard/75496.html)^(E) and [ISO 24443](https://www.iso.org/standard/75059.html)^(E) are about 40% through their respective development processes, by the way, so that’s something to keep an eye on if you’re looking into this stuff.\n\n**EDIT:** u/lovethewayyoulick has posted [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gycvnq4/) about the formulation of Allie sunscreens, specifically regarding Kao/Kanebo’s proprietary “[ADVAN Technology](https://www.kao.com/jp/skincare/surface/surface-02/),\" the name ADVAN coming from “Anti-Damaging uV-A Network.” In a nutshell, their sunscreens are designed to work with sebum to provide higher UVA protection, which would not be reproducible with standard *in vitro* testing. It also seems to explain why Allie sunscreens don't always do too well in casual experiments using light-sensitive materials (as I discuss in the section I had to delete for length posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyc9sqv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I’m now also thinking of other Japanese sunscreens that claim to work with different factors to increase their protection. Shiseido’s [Anessa](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/about/) sunscreens, for instance, advertise their “Thermo-Booster Technology” to work with heat and “Aqua-Booster Technology” to work with sweat and water. These product-specific factors may not necessarily be taken into account in third party testing.\n\n**Other possible issues:** Even after looking into all this (without actually reading all the publicly available details in each ISO… sorry, that’s beyond my mental capacity right now), I still don’t know whether the difference between the testing methods would really explain the larger disparities in the SPF results, like the Fancl sunscreen. I’ve seen some of you make a very good point that how old the bottle used for the test is (and I would assume things like storage conditions; last summer was a particularly hot one, and some supplements I ordered from the US arrived practically melted together in the bottle) or even the specific batch could potentially affect test results, too.\n\nFor more information about the actual testing methods, see [\\[Discussion\\]How SPF and PA are measured in Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mqysux/discussionhow_spf_and_pa_are_measured_in_japan/) by u/ysy_heart. (I want to note that the SPF testing methods described here are based on ISO 24444:2010 and have technically been phased out, but it seems general enough to be at least mostly applicable for ISO 24444:2019, too.)\n\n*—Phew, that was long! I keep seeing this report being mentioned, so I wanted to try my best to do my due diligence. I don’t have a background in science, though, and it’s my first time even actually looking at ISOs, so I’m sorry if I’m completely off.*\n\n# National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan (May 2020)\n\nIn another [report by the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/)^(E) published in May 2020, either the 2018 formula or the 2020 formula of the Allie gel (unclear) was confirmed to be SPF 50+ PA++++ in two out of two tests using a spectrophotometer, though I’m honestly skeptical of the general accuracy of these tests, seeing how four sunscreens claiming to be SPF 30–35 tested consistently at SPF 50+. I guess Japanese companies *could* plausibly be motivated to label their products with lower ratings than what they actually are, since many consumers here believe that high-SPF products are rough on your skin and can actively seek lower-SPF products for daily use, but as an amateur, it seems like it would be easier to actually make a low-SPF product if that’s what you want to sell.\n\nAgain, these tests were performed with an *entirely* different method, and I imagine their results can only be used to draw comparisons with other results in this same report, if anything at all. (For more information on the testing method, see u/ysy_heart’s research and thoughts in the link for the report.)  If there’s so much hubbub about the testing methods in the HKCC report, I’m sure testing with a spectrophotometer would be even further off. I want to give the NCACJ credit for at least running each test twice instead of just doing it once and being done with it, but I also don’t know whether running the spectrophotometer tests even a hundred times would necessarily be credible.\n\nAlso, although the HKCC report seems to have product name errors too (I’ll cut them some slack because they’re dealing with products from other countries, and the photo helps with product identification), I can definitively say that the report the NCACJ published has [some mistakes and ambiguities](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/mx54m7/discussionthirdparty_testing_on_27_japanese/gvsj5eh).^(E) This doesn’t necessarily mean that the tests themselves are equally faulty, but it does make me wary of any other potential mistakes in printing the test results.\n\n# The Chinese version\n\nThe Allie gel is also rated SPF 50+ PA++++ [in China](https://allie.cn)^(SC) (and SPF 45 PA++++ after being immersed in water according to [their official TMall page](https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a212k0.12153887.0.0.1a67687dAgrr3k&id=596686898582),^(SC) if I’m interpreting “浴后防晒指数” correctly), where they require testing at National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) accredited labs in China, as well as additional *in vivo* testing ([source](https://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Article/2019/08/19/Sunscreen-regulations-in-the-world-from-European-Union-USA-Canada-to-China)^(E)). The NMPA-approved testing methods seem to be detailed in [this 11 MB PDF](https://www.nmpa.gov.cn/directory/web/nmpa/images/MjAxNcTqtdoyNji6xbmruOa4vbz+LnBkZg==.pdf)^(SC) of their Safety and Technical Standards for Cosmetics (2015), SPF testing from p. 546 and PA or PFA testing from p. 554. I’ve given up on trying to decipher everything, but it appears that their SPF testing either follows or is based on ISO 24444:2010 (so it might have been updated by now), using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III, and their PA testing either follows or is based on ISO 24442:2011, using test subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV.\n\nInitially I was satisfied in thinking of this as another separate test performed on the Allie gel, but then it occurred to me that I don’t know whether the Chinese version has the same formulation as the Japanese version or not, though I assume they would at least be very similar. [Based on the packaging](https://imgur.com/a/WbH2gAS),^(E) I’m guessing that the current version there is basically equivalent to Allie Extra UV Gel (the 2018 formula in Japan). [This page](https://www.jeebei.com/pingce/hufupin/ql1z6.html) lists the ingredients as follows:\n\n> 水，乙醇，氧化锌，三乙氧基辛基硅烷，甲氧基肉桂酸乙基己酯，丁羟甲苯，甘油三（乙基己酸）酯，异壬酸异壬酯，丙烯酸钠/丙烯酰二甲基牛磺酸钠共聚物，异十六烷，聚山梨醇酯-80，丁二醇，甘油，双-乙基己氧苯酚甲氧苯基三嗪，乙基己基三嗪酮，聚二甲基硅氧烷，黄原胶，EDTA 二钠，水解胶原，苯氧乙醇，透明质酸钠\n\nThis translates to:\n\n> Water, Ethanol, Zinc Oxide, Trimethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, BHT, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\nThis is the ingredient list for the Japanese 2018 formula, according to the packaging of a tube I bought in a major drugstore in Japan:\n\n> Water, Zinc Oxide, Ethanol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Triethylhexanoin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 80, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Collagen\n\n*Both are my own translations and I don’t have a background in chemistry. Also, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate = Octinoxate, Ethylhexyl Triazone = Uvinul T 150, and Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine = Tinosorb S.*\n\nObviously, the order of the ingredients differ, but I don’t know whether China has the same rules about the order of the ingredients or not. One definitively different point, though, is that the Chinese version contains Phenoxyethanol and the Japanese version doesn’t. So while I can’t say how different or similar the two versions might be, it’s clear that they aren’t exactly the same.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that the [Bioré UV Athlizm essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-athlizm-skin-protect-essence/)^(E) and the [Bioré UV Aqua Rich gel](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-gel-2019/)^(E) and [essence](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/biore-uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-2019/)^(E) are all rated SPF 50+ PA+++ [in China](https://www.kao.com/cn/products/biore/),^(SC) and not SPF 50+ PA++++ as they are rated in Japan, but since they are sold ~~(and possibly manufactured)~~ locally by Kao (China) Holding Co., Ltd. rather than as import products from Japan, you would have to consider the possibility that they may not necessarily have the same formulation as the Japanese equivalents.\n\n**EDIT:** I’ve just figured out that the Chinese versions of the Allie gel and Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence are made in Japan with different formulations specifically for the Chinese market. See links re: each product [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/nds8nn/discussion_on_spfpa_testing_in_japan_and_the/gyhq3fu).\n\nSimilarly, RatzillaCosme says in a comment on [this page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-gel-spf50-4-plus/) that “Rohto products that are marketed for outside of Japan have different ingredients/formulas than Japan’s and they’re not Japan-made (despite the Japanese printed). If the Japanese version is what you want, both the packaging and product name need to be exactly the same as what \\[is\\] shown in my site.” They also say in a comment [here](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence-2020/) in response to an inquiry about [Sunplay Skin Aqua](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/index.shtml) Watery Essence SPF 50+ PA++++ (I’m not sure but possibly [this](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-75.shtml)^(SC)), “That product isn’t Japanese — it’s made in China by a different company. It isn’t produced by Rohto Pharmaceutical in Japan.” (Credit goes to someone on this sub for mentioning that Ratzilla talks about this in their comments section. I’m sorry I can’t remember who it was.) Going back to the HKCC report, the results table says that [Sunplay Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Gel](http://www.mentholatum.com.cn/home/products/skincare/sunplay/detail-72.shtml)^(SC) is manufactured in China (in addition to the “Sunplay” in the product name already being a giveaway; in Japan, [Mentholatum Sunplay](https://jp.rohto.com/uv-sunplay/) is a separate Rohto brand alongside Skin Aqua, so “Sunplay Skin Aqua” doesn’t exist), so the results in the report would not necessarily be applicable for the Japanese product, not to mention the other concerns I discussed.\n\nSo the situation arises where there are products that aren’t “fake” but also aren’t exactly the same thing as what’s sold in Japan, kind of like how the American versions of LRP sunscreens wouldn't contain their more advanced filters (which is probably more drastic of a difference than what I’m discussing here). This might be especially important for anyone buying the product from non-Japanese vendors. Double check to make sure you’re getting the version you intended to buy—and if you specifically wanted the non-Japanese version, that’s great too. Like [the American and Japanese Curél Intensive Moisture Creams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/labr3m/difference_between_japanese_and_american_version/), it’s possible that the end result (the user experience) is pretty much the same anyway, but in the case of sunscreen, make sure you know what the SPF/PA rating is for the exact version you’re buying.\n\n# Using sunscreens from major corporations\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNsoPyo1PjA)^(J) posted on March 26, 2020, skinfluencer Arata Tomori says that SPF testing is usually outsourced to a third party lab, and that PA testing is often performed in-house (I haven’t looked into this). She says that different labs can come up with different results, and based on her own past experience with trying to make a sunscreen (I think she has her own skincare line), she has heard of labs that are actually known to give higher SPF ratings. She recommends that we stick with major corporations that are more likely to be working with labs that would provide accurate results.\n\nIn [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTS0Xd-T97s)^(J) posted on March 28, 2020, cosmetic chemist YouTuber Sumisho discusses issues with SPF ratings in general, with the AMA Laboratories case in the US as an example. He says we should be careful with smaller brands, and advises that it’s a good idea to pick products that are made by major corporations that put a lot into sunscreen R&D. He also advises that products sold in China go through additional testing and could be more reliable, and that you could check Tmall for listings, but I want to add again that you would need to make sure you’re looking at the version you want.\n\nOdile Monod also breaks down the difference between OBM, OEM, and ODM products in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GC8r3S0i0Ro) I mentioned earlier. Although she’s talking about the Korean beauty industry, I think this part probably applies for other countries, too, and she advises that it’s (not necessarily foolproof but) a good idea to pick OBM products that are formulated and manufactured in-house.\n\nAnd now [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/n8afq7/discussiondirector_of_japan_cosmetic_industry/) about the response u/ysy_heart got from the JCIA director can be interpreted to back up this approach as well. I’m generally in favor of indie brands in spirit, and usually I would think more about how these people might be benefiting from making these claims, but I do see how major corporations would have a lot more to lose from these sunscreen scandals. I also don’t think I’ve seen companies like Amorepacific (for instance) mentioned in connection with the recent scandal in Korea.\n\nI’m still looking up different sunscreens and who actually manufactures them, but the Kao Group (including Kanebo), the Kosé Group, the Pola Orbis Group, the Rohto Group, and the Shiseido Group are some major Japanese corporations that seem to generally have OBM products. I have a huge spreadsheet in progress that I plan on sharing whenever I think it’s ready, with specific products from these companies (and others) and some properties I wanted to compare.\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re *really* concerned about the accuracy of SPF/PA ratings, I guess the truly thorough approach would be to look at as many tests as possible. You could either stick with the sunscreens that consistently do well in third party testing (guilty until proven innocent) or avoid those that consistently do poorly (innocent until proven guilty).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it just isn’t realistic, especially considering how frequently Japanese sunscreens are reformulated. A test result from last year might not be applicable for a product that was reformulated this year. You would have to make sure where the product tested was manufactured and what year it was released, and then there are the potential issues with storage conditions and different batches, etc. Also, “real” testing is expensive, and it’s not all that likely that there would be multiple credible third party tests following official protocols performed on the same formulation.\n\nAs Professor Tong says in the *South China Morning Post* article, we should probably accept that no single test is going to be an absolutely definitive one. Personally, with regard to what I’m already using, if it’s keeping my sun allergy symptoms from showing up, that’s good enough for me—but I guess you could say that I have the advantage (?) of my face being a hypersensitive UV meter of sorts. As for any products I might try in the future, I’m going to keep trusting the ratings as they are claimed unless there’s a scandal specifically involving that product. We *are* already taking a kind of leap of faith in trusting that the product is otherwise safe to use and that the ingredient list is correct and so on. And regardless of any tests results, even good ones, I would make sure to apply plenty, to reapply, and to avoid relying on sunscreen alone, especially if I’m going to be outside for an extended amount of time.",

I’ve been living in Japan for over 10 years, and am under the impression that the general consensus among Japanese consumers is that you use either Anessa or Allie if you don’t want to tan/burn, Anessa being top-level protection and Allie coming in second while also being easier on your skin. (This seems to specifically be based on Anessa’s [flagship milk](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/anessa-perfect-uv-sunscreen-skincare-milk-a-2020/)^(E) and Allie’s gel products, even though Anessa also has gels and Allie also has a milk.)\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean they’re absolutely the best sunscreens in the entire Japanese market, of course—the products discussed on this sub represent just a small fraction of all the sunscreens available in Japan—nor do I know how they would really compare with European sunscreens (which I’ve never used, aside from a couple of Asia/Australia-specific LRP products), but it does suggest that they must at least be among the best that are commonly available in drugstores nationwide.\n\nAllie sunscreens seem to do well in those completely unscientific experiment memes where people apply a ton of different sunscreens on their backs and lay out in the sun:\n\n|**Video/Article**|**Sunscreens and UV source**|**Conclusion**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sunameri for Kakaku.com, [人気の日焼け止め10種を徹底比較！ 日サロで肌を焼いて効果を確かめてみた](https://kakakumag.com/houseware/?id=11834), January 14, 2019|10 sunscreens including Allie Extra UV Gel (2018 formula);

I religiously used the Biore sunscreen in high school but I still got a little tan at the end of summer, so I moved \"up\" to Allie sunscreen once I graduated and I haven't looked back since. I always got a little worried about these reports coming out about my beloved Allie sunscreen, but I feel confident about it now. I went to the sunny beaches Australia, Okinawa, Thailand, and Hawaii with my Allie sunscreen and I've never gotten a bad tan! Granted, I was wearing sunglasses, a hat, and occasionally a sun umbrella but I think that proves your final thoughts - apply plenty and reapply, reapply, reapply!",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

[Go here instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/9io2vi/improvedtexture_keto_friendly_ice_cream_recipe_in/)\n\nThe chemistry of ice cream and how to make it really fascinates me. Unlike many other desserts where the sugar's sole function is to sweeten, ice cream employs it to achieve an appealing structure and texture. Those of you who have dabbled in low-sugar ice cream making know that this texture is extremely difficult to replicate.\n\nI've tried vodka, I've tried rennet tablets, I've experimented with various sweeteners and several different ratios of fat to milk to nut milk. Some of these were passable, but all were obvious runners-up to a more \"real\" ice cream texture. However, I think I stumbled upon my favorite method yet, one I can return to time and again in a world of increasingly higher-carb Halo Top. If it's not 100% like the real thing, it's close enough to appease my tastes.\n\nThe secret, of all things, ended up being a lowly teaspoon of unflavored gelatin. Available at just about any grocery store. I actually came across the idea reading a recipe for dairy-free ice cream (non-keto, goes to show you can always learn from unexpected teachers). The author suggested gelatin to help mitigate the hard-freezing behavior of non-churned ice cream base. But I figured there was no reason I couldn't try it with the recipe I'd been using. Special thanks to /u/bmorelegalbeagle, whose [recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes/comments/4ozrxb/lower_calorie_ketofriendly_ice_cream_base/) I have adapted into this form. The vodka just didn't do it for me but it was a super helpful starting point. And here is my take:\n\n**Ingredients**\n-----\n* 1 pint heavy whipping cream\n* 1 quart half and half\n* Any granulated sweetener equivalent to 1 cup (or as much as 1 1/3 cup) sugar. I use [Pyure](https://www.amazon.com/Pyure-Organic-All-Purpose-Stevia-Sweetener/dp/B00NI2CTB0), which is twice as sweet, so 1/2-2/3 cup.^([1])\n* 6 egg yolks (separated from the whites)\n* 1/2 tsp table salt\n* 1 Tbsp vanilla\n* 1 tsp xanthan gum (optional)\n* 2 tsp unflavored gelatin^([2]) (divided this if you divide the custard)\n\n**Special-ish Equipment**\n-----\n* Ice cream maker - I use one that has a pre-freezable mixing bucket (the rock salt and ice song 'n' dance is a royal pain) and so that's what I've tested this recipe with. Obviously, you'll need to take any needed preliminary measures to prep your own ice cream maker.\n* Kitchen thermometer\n* Fine mesh strainer (optional but recommended)\n\n**Directions**\n-----\n1. Pour the cream, half and half, and sweetener into a big-enough saucepan; set to medium-low heat.\n2. While the dairy is heating, separate your egg yolks into a small-medium bowl. You can use just the shells if you're a wizard, but I'm a wuss and have a separator handy.^([3])\n3. Let the milk mixture to heat to around 170F, stirring occasionally to prevent too much of a film to form at the top. Don't let it boil!\n4. Once heated, whisk some into the egg yolk bowl, continually stirring, to temper the yolks.\n5. Add the tempered yolks, salt, and vanilla into the pan with the rest of the base and mix well.\n6. Let it simmer for just a minute or two. If you have an electric stove, turn it off and let the residual heat do the work.\n7. Remove from heat. *Gradually* whisk in the xanthan gum - seriously, as slowly as you can because this stuff will clump up very easily.\n8. Strain the base evenly into two bowls (or just one, if you have a big ice cream maker) to remove any prematurely cooked egg yolk or xanthan clumpage.\n9. If you have any flavorings that need to be dissolved with heat (e.g. cocoa, instant coffee), now is the time to mix them in, while it's still warm.\n10. Put your first (and/or only) bowl into the freezer to chill quickly. You want it to have *just* begun to freeze up at the edges before you start your churn. The other bowl (if applicable) will keep for a couple days.\n11. When your base is sufficiently chilled, ready your ice cream maker. Then take the mixture out and stir in the gelatin. It won't clump as badly as the xanthan gum, but stir it well. If you have any flavor extracts that don't need heat to mix in well, add them now. Make sure any slightly frozen bits have melted back into the liquid base.\n12. Prep your ice cream maker, pour in the base, and follow the manufacturer instructions. When finished churning, it should have about doubled in volume and be nice and light, like soft-serve.^([4])\n13. Scrape/scoop/extricate the ice cream into a bowl with a lid, close that up, and place in the freezer to ripen. If you have any solid mix-ins (e.g. keto cookie crumbs, bits of dark chocolate), I'd gently fold them in before storing. \n14. Serve when frozen to satisfaction (or just eat a bowl straight away, I won't judge). It might get slightly harder than desired in the freezer, if so just soften in the fridge for ten minutes and it will be perfectly scoopable again.\n\n**GIFs**\n-----\n[The churn](https://gfycat.com/UglyAllChital)\n\n[Finished churning](https://gfycat.com/PlasticGlumInsect)\n\n[Scooping](https://gfycat.com/SerpentineLargeAmericanwigeon)\n\n**Macros**\n-----\nThese assume you used Pyure as the sweetener.

I am not sure what to expect from this.~~ **Update**: I tried some sugar-free Jell-O instead of unflavored gelatin, in the same amount.

        "body": "I have to make a pitch for my favorite sweetener. \n\nSo I hate stevia, I find that the only affordable and workable version of sucralose exists mixed with a bunch of maltodextrin, and erythritol, which is awesome, needs to be ground to a fine powder to work with anything. \n\nThen I had a Quest Hero Bar. \n\nThe sugar they use...\"Allulose\" is 0.2 calories per gram, effectively meaning that it takes 20 grams of allulose to equal one net carb (roughly). \n\nI ended up buying a bag last week. Yes it's expensive. \n\nI don't know what to say other than you can fool me into thinking it's sugar. It feels like sugar, has the same sweet taste. Dissolves readily into cold liquids even in it's granulated form. \n\n\nIt's a miracle sweetener, and I look forward to whoever takes it mainstream. I plan on making this recipe using allulose and I expect it to be the ultimate low carb ice cream. \n\n***\n\nSide note - isn't 1tsp of xanthan a lot? I know you're freezing this and keeping it creamy and stable, but I generally find that unless I'm using a 5 gallon stock pot, 1/4 tsp is the most I ever need, and sometimes, it gums up whatever I'm making too much.",

Blend the heck out of the chilled base before adding it to the ice cream maker.  This adds air to the mix.\n\n3.) Transfer the finished ice cream immediately into a chilled glass bowl and place in the freezer w/o the top. Once firm, then you can put the top on. \n\n4.)

I still added guar gum and xanthan gum and all that, but the texture just never really came out right. It would always be a little icy or kinda weird.\n\nAfter I switched to using an immersion blender though, it was like night and day. Same ingredients, same stabilizers, literally the only thing I changed was using the immersion blender and now the ice cream comes out crazy smooth every time.\n\nIf you're still getting icy or crumbly textures, seriously try it. I wish I’d figured it out sooner lol.",

This is my opportunity to contribute to this community. Please be kind to one another while debating.*\n\nBACKSTORY:\n\nI am fulfilling a prior reddit comment about doing a comparison between older and newer Huy Fong Foods sriracha, plus Underwood Ranch's Dragon Sriracha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those not aware, Underwood Farms was the original pepper supplier to Huy Fong Foods.  Legal actions and business decisions appear to have impacted Huy Fong's product.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/05/sriracha-sauce-lawsuit-huy-fong-underwood)\n\n[https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2021/b303096.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderwood Ranch has released their own sriracha (\"Dragon Sriracha\") which uses peppers formerly used by Huy Fong Foods.  I had to purchase their product via their website, as their grocery store distribution is limited.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gll4xm37lp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=272ce0c6d9b4ab32889f38dd0c9a64e404c5ca12\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jx7johukp8c1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=19d25fcce2011a94cf7cd5d9af3ee516bc564c0b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqp1nmhukp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=22bab97e4e4f4ff80cecf6ff3496d9311973285e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/to364dhukp8c1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=083f3eb787c4c933c7b8f76d0eca21c4f75c69e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4fc5lvgukp8c1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=31be9f2f6e766da1f2b51caeda4c4f5760f11021\n\nABOUT THE PRODUCTS:\n\nThis reddit community has opinions on taste differences between the older and newer Huy Fong srirachas. I happen to have bottles of older and newer Huy Fong Srirachas (28oz version);  I recently bought the Underwood Ranch sriracha (17oz).\n\nThe older bottle (expiration 2018) was opened some time during Summer 2023, then subsequently refrigerated.\n\nThe newer bottle (expiration 2025) was opened some time during December 202**3**, then subsequently refrigerated.\n\nI purchased the 16oz Underwood Ranch \"Dragon Sriracha\" in December 2023, opening it December 26, 2023 and refrigerating for several hours before using.  This is also my FIRST TIME tasting the Dragon Sriracha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTASTE TESTS:\n\n1. I cooked Grade AA eggs *as scrambled eggs*; nothing added to the whisked eggs, e.g. milk, butter, spices.  I added real bacon (precooked Kirkland-brand from Costco) to the eggs as they cooked.  Each of the srirachas was added to a section of the cooked scrambled eggs/bacon for a mid-day meal. (See photo)\n\n2) I used three separate spoons to taste each of the srirachas.  Given the strength of hot sauce, I used a small amount which I ate/swallowed from the spoons.  (I drank water as a rinse/spit between each test.)\n\nThese tests are imperfect, as each taste may have had some affect on the other tastings.  BUT I consider myself to have good taste buds;  I was able to gauge both heat and flavors without a problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY OPINION:\n\nThe older Huy Fong sriracha has had time to ferment, due to age.  This may have altered the taste to a degree. It still retained its peppery sharpness, its slight sweetness and the familiar refrigerated consistency.  The bottle was almost empty when I used it. It was delicious.\n\nThe newer Huy Fong sriracha IS DIFFERENT.  The flavor possesses something slightly saltier mixed with the sweetness.  The sharp pepper flavor is largely absent; the heat is more mild than the older version.  It is still delicious, although I can actually taste not one type of salt, but actually make out different salt tastes infused in the sauce.\n\nThe winner?  **Underwood Ranch's \"Dragon Sriracha\".**\n\n*OMG, this stuff is INCREDIBLY OG!!!*  Yes, it's fresh, compared to the older Huy Fong sriracha I had.  But it is flavor from Heaven!  (I've tried other srirachas, including Dynasty, Sky Valley, Tabasco, among others. Not in the same category.)\n\nThe flavor is intense, warm (even hot) and wonderful!!  The consistency is akin to Huy Fong sriracha; the color is slightly darker, though.  And I got more pepper and garlic taste than sweetness--which was noticeable, but not like the newer Huy Fong sriracha.  I wasn't overwhelmed with salt flavor(s), which is kinda surprising after viewing the ingredients.\n\nIf you're familiar with the original Huy Fong Foods sriracha, then you will get that 'taste flashback' since Underwood produced peppers which were used (past tense) for Huy Fong Foods sriracha. (Oh, how the mighty have indeed fallen!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE THE INGREDIENTS FOR Huy Fong srirachas:\n\n(Expiration 2018)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate, contains Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, and Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Expiration 2025)\n\nChili, Sugar, Salt, Garlic, Acetic Acid, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulfite as preservatives, Xanthan Gum\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding Acetic Acid:  Vinegar is at least 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. It has been used, as a component of vinegar throughout history from at least the third century BC.\n\nNo idea why Huy Fong chose \"Distilled Vinegar\" for the older ingredients vs. \"Acetic Acid\" in the newer (even though acetic acid is in vinegar).\n\nNote that the older Huy Fong sriracha says \"MADE IN U.S.A. WITH CALIFORNIA PRODUCE\" while the newer Huy Fong sriracha only says \"MADE IN U.S.A.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, fellow redditors, there you go!**  Hope more of you will consider posting your thoughts/experiences, too.  For the price, Huy Fong is a much less expensive option.  But for true quality, *Underwood Ranch is the BEST, imho.*  I \\*will\\* be purchasing more of their product!",

I'm just a regular consumer buying everything with my own money - i.e., nothing sponsored, etc. Note, I've bought all of them on sale for around AUD$15-20 because I like sales haha.\n\nProducts:\n\n1. PKY - essence toner;\n2. PKY - mist toner;\n3. Secret Key - fresh nature toner - milk brightening one;\n4. Benton - Aloe BHA Toner;\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner; and\n6. Purito - Centella Green Level Calming Toner & the unscented version (Purito Unscented Centella Toner)\n\nMy skin used to be severely dry but is now slightly dry on the cheek areas and slightly oily on the t-zone during summer and slightly dry on the whole face in the winter.\n\nAlso note that the below two PKY products have different 'actives'/hero ingredients notwithstanding them seemingly being quite similar! I've bolded the plant extracts under the ingredient headers below.\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Essence Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approximately AUD$20 for $100mL, AUD$26 for $200mL. You can buy it at most Asian Beauty places, e.g., [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1060395495), *Australian* websites: [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/collections/pyunkang-yul/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner-200ml).\n\n**Who's it for:** People with dry/dehydrated skin, especially if it's sensitive or irritated. *Note, this one is generally recommended for people with drier skin whereas the mist version is generally recommended for those with oilier skin* Friends with eczema have also used this with success. *.* I can use both year round without breaking out. I've had friends with oilier skin who've used this one and have broken out. YMMV.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** LOVE THIS. May repurchase this for the rest of my life. I've used this after breaking my moisture barrier, after chemical peels, after active masks, and also *after getting my face ablatively lasered (after the the initial few days of only using an ointment)*. It's REALLY benign in a godly way. If you want it to do anything other than hydrate or increase the penetration of your other actives, this isn't the product for you (note, it doesn't claim to do anything else apart from hydrate & calm really).\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a little bit thicker than water but not as thick as the Purito centella toners. Won't run off your hand/face like water will but will eventually run off.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** None at allll, even when I broke my moisture barrier.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? Yes**/I have rebought this 4 or so times so far.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: PyunKang Yul (PKY) Mist Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner with no fragrance or 'natural' fragrance.

This one is more for people with slightly oilier skin too. It's a lighter formula than the essence one.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** since approx. November 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Decent hydration, I prefer to use this in the toner stage instead of after my skincare but I have enjoyed using it as a 'refreshing' spray during the day.\n\n**Smell:** No noticeable scent.\n\n**Feel:** a nice mist, doesn't run on the face. Feels like a spray of water?\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a spray bit on top. I've had no issues with it but one mate had a couple that didn't spray properly.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** Unsure. I've rebought it once but haven't gone to use this one as much as I have the PKY essence toner or the Purito Unscented Centella Toner. I also don't like mists a whole bunch as they can go onto your clothes (if you're out) or jewellery if you're wearing any. But, I did go through a phase of keeping it in my handbag and using it when out and about for a bit of hydration.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**Coptis Japonica Extract**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Secret Key - Fresh nature Toner (Milk Brightening)**\n\n**What is it:** Hydrating toner that's meant to brighten your skin.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx.

Couldn't use it long enough to notice anything.\n\n**Smell:** A very strong scent that I could barely use it. I think I used it around 5-10 times before binning it - I couldn't even put up with the scent of this to use it on other parts of my body.\n\n**Feel:** really watery.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a cap on top. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Fortunately (given the high fragrance), no reactions to this. If you had any irritation though, I'd expect some sort of reaction.\n\n**Would I rebuy it? No**, given I threw mine out.\n\n**Ingredients:** Not a comprehensive list given there's a generic list on yesstyle then a list below it for the main ones in the milk one but here -\n\n700ppm) \\[**sic**\\], 1, 2-Hexandiol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata Extract, Nonoxynol-12, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Tremella Fuciformis Extract, Allantoin, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Cucumber Extract, Propylene Glycol, Tomato Extract, Diospyros Kaki Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Rice Extract, Lanoline, Tea Tree Leaf Water (9, Sciadopitys Verticillata Root Extract, Pumpkin Extract, Papaya Fruit Extract, Oleth-10, Viola Tricolor Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Ethanol, Glyceryl Stearate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Chamomilia Recutita Flower Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Lemon Extract, Oleth-5, Sodium Hyaluronate, Potato Extract, Pomegranate Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Sap Extract, Bean Extract, Aloe Vera Leaf Water (9, Broccoli Extract, Glycerin, Green Tea Extract, Plantago Asiatica Extract, Hollyhock Root Extract, Witch Hazel Extract (9, Phenoxyethanol, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Mineral Oil, Ulmus Campestris Extract, Carrot Extract, Polysorbate 80, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rose Damascena Flower Water (9, Korean Raspberry Extract, Milk Protein Extract (9, White Willow Bark Extract, Psidium Guajava Fruit Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, 4-Terpineol, Algae Extract\n\nand then it says the main ones in the milk version are -\n\ngalactomyces ferment filtrate, pomegranate extract, physalis alkenkengi extract, milk protein concentrate, raspberry extract, pasque flower extract, potato extract, carrot extract, pumpkin extract, rice extract, usnea extract, broccoli extract\n\nso who really knows what's in it...\n\n\\---\n\n**Product: Benton Aloe BHA Toner**\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating toner which is meant to gently exfoliate with 0.5% salicylic acid.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$23. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/benton-aloe-bha-skin-toner-200ml-200ml/info.html/pid.1053033537), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** people with sensitive and dry skin as it's quite rich.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** on and off since mid 2020, still using it randomly to just use it up.\n\n**My thoughts:** Per Google (may not be accurate), it has a pH of 5.5 which is too high for there to be any noticeable exfoliation with 0.5% BHA present. I've not noticed any calming effects. It is definitely hydrating but given it's advertised as a BHA toner I'm quite disappointed at the lack of BHA efficacy here. I would much rather use the purito centella toner to hydrate and calm my skin as the centella has other benefits such as helping to stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** Similar to the PKY essence toner. Not as thick as the purito centella toners.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a pump on top. No issues with it, but it can come out a bit forcefully sometimes.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **No**, almost threw it out but am trying to use it up.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Water (80%), Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Beta-Glucan, Polyglutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Portulaca Oleracea (Green Purslane) Extract, Psidium Guajava (Guava) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid (0.5%), Althaea Rosea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract (200mg), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice (200mg), Arginine, Pentylene Glycol, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Polysorbate 20, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Xanthan Gum\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** **Etude House - Soon Jung pH 5.5 relief toner**\n\n**What is it:** A benign, hydrating toner.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$25 for 180mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soon-jung-ph-5-5-relief-toner-180ml-180ml/info.html/pid.1058586258), etc.\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone. It adds light hydration with benign ingredients - akin to the PKY toners but very minimally more expensive. It'd be good if you have irritated and/or dry skin.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** I used it once/twice a day until I used it up. Bought it in December 2019.\n\n**My thoughts:** Pretty decent. I'd recommend this to the same group of people who'd use the PKY essence toner. Nothing ground breaking. I prefer the calming nature of the Purito Unscented Centella Toner or even the PKY essence toner if you want zero actives (if you consider centella an 'active').\n\n**Smell:** I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** A watery toner.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Nope!\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** No but for no fault of the product. I just prefer using the Purito Unscented Centella one as it's just as benign, a bit cheaper, and has the benefits of centella.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, Propanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polyglycerin-3, Disodium EDTA\n\n\\---\n\n**Product:** [**Centella Green Level Calming Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/tcuc.AUD/coc.AU/info.html/pid.1096284833?cpid=1096284832&googtrans=en&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=1432946521&utm_term=&utm_medium=Shopping&bac=RSLH0H2K&%243p=a_google_adwords&%24always_deeplink=false&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&gclid=CjwKCAiAxeX_BRASEiwAc1QdkSiy5L_5HStQ0k_DxyVaaeZynypBj60LWIj7A4sr8SwGrgW3ztcOcxoC4kYQAvD_BwE&~ad_set_id=55566497709&~campaign_id=1432946521&~channel=Google%20Ads&~keyword=&~placement=&~feature=Shopping&%24fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yesstyle.com%2Fen%2Ftcuc.AUD%2Fcoc.AU%2Finfo.html%2Fpid.1096284833%3Fcpid%3D1096284832%26googtrans%3Den%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1432946521%26utm_term%3D%26utm_medium%3DShopping%26bac%3DRSLH0H2K&_branch_match_id=767372048158521804) **& the** [**Centella Unscented Toner**](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380)\n\n**What is it:** A hydrating and calming toner - may also stimulate collagen production.\n\n**Cost & where to buy:** Approx. AUD$30 but I've always bought it on sale for approx. AUD$20-25 for 200mL. You can buy this at most of your Asian Beauty retailers such as [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/purito-centella-unscented-toner-2-types-200ml-witch-hazel-free/info.html/pid.1095881380), [Nudie Glow](https://nudieglow.com/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner), [Lila Beauty](https://lilabeauty.com.au/products/centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml), [Heart Drops](https://heartdrops.com.au/products/purito-centella-green-level-calming-toner-200ml)\n\n**Who's it for:** IMO anyone however this is best suited to those with any sort of irritation, acne, or redness. That is, if you have basically perfect skin you're probably not going to notice much of a difference but if you have irritation etc then you'll likely fall in love. Also good if you're wanting to help stimulate collagen production especially for the low price point - target ages for this is probably mid twenties and up.\n\n**How long have I used it for:** religiously since April 2020, sometimes twice a day.\n\n**My thoughts:** *BLOODY EXCELLENT*. I'm on my second bottle of this. My first bottle was the first listed one (scented) and then they released the unscented one so I bought that! It's incredible. I love it. In my opinion, it's partially why my skin is able to tolerate me using actives so much. It's excellent to use before actives as it doesn't interact with anything and really good to use after an 'active' mask or a clay mask etc. I switched to the unscented one to just reduce the risk of irritation.\n\n*also studies, which I haven't read but have seen derms I trust on insta etc, say that* ***centella can help stimulate/produce collagen... a big yes from me given it's a calming ingredient that shouldn't purge you or break you out*** *(unless you're allergic/sensitive to it)!*\n\n**Smell:** The scented one smells herbaceous (akin to Asian herbal medicine - I don't mind it but others may). The unscented one doesn't really smell like anything / I don't notice any scent.\n\n**Feel:** thick/fat/heavy water. Not a watery toner. Enjoyable.\n\n**Packaging:** generically decent, nothing new, a regular plastic bottle that's got a hole in the top and you turn upside down and shakey it to get the product. No issues with it.\n\n**Adverse reactions when using it?** Neverrrrrr, this helps me reduce the side effects from using actives such as retinoids, AHAs, BHAs, etc.\n\n**Would I rebuy it?** **Yes** & I have. Will probably rebuy for life.\n\n**Ingredients:** 4 variants as they've got the scented and unscented versions, and then those with and without witch hazel\n\nnon-witch hazel unscented version -\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract (strengthens skin barrier), Butylene Glycol (humectants), Pentylene Glycol (skin-conditioning agents), Dipropylene Glycol (humectants), 1,2-Hexanediol (stabilizers), Trehalose (humectants), Sodium Hyaluronate (natural moisturizing factor/ humectants), Hamemelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiaticoside (strengthens skin barrier), Asiatic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Madecassic Acid (strengthens skin barrier), Panthenol (strengthens skin barrier), Carbomer (viscosity increasing agents), Allantoin (skin protectants), Arginine (skin-conditioning agents), Portulaca Oleracea Extract (skin-conditioning agents), Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agents), Disodium EDTA (stabilizers)\n\nI hope these reviews were useful :)",

I would only trust claims I can see after using a product. \n\n\nAs far as I know, topical creams cannot generate collagen production. Collagen is created from the foods you eat. I’m not even sure you can take collagen supplements to increase collagen production because everything in your body is broken down in the same way and your body will direct the amino acids to where the body needs it most and not where you might want it.",

I tested all products with the recommended 1.5-2.5 mL amount. (Full inci in links. [Tested products](http://imgur.com/a/6nT48) are mentioned in order of how good the ingredients and ss actives are. In the notes at the end of this post is the order of greasiness and explanation on my whitecast scale). High UVA protection ss is great, but don't forget the role of sunglasses, hats and uv protective clothing.\n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (the best in my opinion)**\n\n* [€39.95/50mL - Uncover Skincare Suncare SPF30/UVA22](https://www.dr-jetskeultee.com/products/skincare/protect/suncare-spf-30-face.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M.\n  * **Whitecast:** 1.5-2  \n  * **Rating:** 7.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This sunscreen uses Tinosorb S and M as the only sunscreen actives, which makes this a very good stable sunscreen, and combined with the non water reistant formula it gives theoretically a low risk of skin irritation and pore clogging. Relatively high uva/uvb ratio (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/1.18). Airless pump, preservative free, non greasy cream texture, slightly sticky, but relatively easy to apply the recommended amount. It is a thicker, more cream like consistency than the Uncover Suncover below. It's not completely matte, but better than Derma and Biodermal. The things I don't like: the slight whitecast and shine, and it could have been a little bit more hydrating.\n  * **Available at:** only online available via their own webshop for EU countries (no usa/canada)\n\n* [€11.30/50mL - MUTI BODY SPF50/UVA20](https://www.muticare.com/muti-sonnencreme)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** Thin runny texture with matte finish, which I guess many will like. You need to work it in well, otherwise you can get some streaks. Very good stable sunscreen actives. Airless pump, preservative free. Unfortunately very high concentration of propylene glycol (1,2 Propanediol), which can be irritating and sensitizing, especially if concentration is higher than 10%, but for sensitive skin already from 2%. So I'm only showing this sunscreen hoping the company will change the Propylene Glycol, because the sunscreen actives and the price are great. (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/2.51)\n\n* [€49/50mL - HighDroxy D Light Fluid SPF25/UVA15](https://www.highdroxy.de/produkt/highdroxy-d-light-fluid/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 2.5 ([see this picture I found](https://konsumkaiser.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_2418-e1463422184478.jpg))\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** comparable to the MUTI one, very thin lightweight texture, but this one uses Propanediol (1,3 Propanediol), although a very similar molecule, apparently studies indicate this is less irritating than Propylene Glycol because the OH groups are at the opposite ends of the molecule, whereas with Propylene Glycol the OH groups are much closer together (above 75% propanediol can be mildly irritating according the CIR safety study). A really great sunscreen with some antioxidants, and very good sunscreen actives, although quite expensive.\n\n* [€17.99/50mL - Biodermal Gevoelige Huid Face Cream SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/gevoelige-huid-zonnecreme-gezicht-spf-50/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  Cream texture, no pilling. For sensitive and dry skin this is really a great option, I really think this is the best hydrating sunscreen from this entire list and although it contains Tinosorb M, it doesn't have visible whitecast. Although it contains mattifying Tapioca Starch, it is shiny. The \"Gevoelige Huid Spray SPF50\" has a comparable formula. The Sensitive Face SPF30, doesn't have any whitecast and contains great sunscreen actives, with the exception of the added Octocrylene.  Other [biodermal sunscreens](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/#!/zon-huid/all/45) are fragranced, or contain Octocrylene/Avobenzone. The fragranced Biodermal Mattifying Zonfluide SPF50+ is just as greasy as the Gevoelige Huid Face SPF50+, although the name would suggest otherwise. Same products are sold in Sweden under the ACO brand and in Norway under Cliniderm and Cosmica. Good Aco products are for example: [ACO Sun Face Fluid ](http://www.yliopistonverkkoapteekki.fi/ACO-SUN-FACE-FLUID-MATTIFYING) and [ACO Kids Sun](http://www.aco.se/produkter/sun/spf-high/high-protection-sun-lotion-spf-50-big-size/). \n  * **Available at:** all drugstores in The Netherlands.\n\n* [€24/50mL - Oriflame Sun Zon UV Protector Face and Exposed Areas SPF50/UVA>16](https://nl.oriflame.com/products/product?code=23378)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** The sunscreen actives and ingredients are comparable to the Biodermal Face SPF50. The body SPF50 version is also good. I think the Biodermal above applies a bit more evenly with less chance of streaks and clumps.\n\n* [€2.75/50mL - Derma Sollotion SPF30/UVA>10](http://www.derma.dk/sollotion-hoej-spf30.aspx?id=126)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Uvasorb HEB\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  applies easily, doesn't pill, very nice sunscreen actives, no irritants and no whitecast, unfortunately it isn't matte (dewy finish) and sometimes I have a feeling my skin doesn't agree with this sunscreen (redness and itching in neck after shaving). Levevis, [Avivir](http://www.aloevera.dk/page124.aspx?recordid124=55), [Rudolph Care Kids](https://www.rudolphcare.dk/en/products/kids-sun-lotion-spf-30) and [Änglamark](http://anglamark.dk/solcreme/) have similar formulas as Derma. \nThere's also a Face version [Derma Ansigtsolcreme SPF30](http://www.derma.dk/ansigtssolcreme-spf-30-hoej.aspx?id=145) packaged in an airless pump, which  absorbs faster and is a little bit less shiny (comparable to the non-profit Uncover Suncover). The face version contains [Tinosorb S Aqua](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/804/240238/Tinosorb-S-Aqua), this active provides a very good uva coverage. The SLES in the product is part of the Tinosorb S Aqua suspension, concentration is <0.07%, companies don't have to list it on the ingredient list since it's part of the standard suspension, so most companies won't list it (Same with Ultrasun not mentioning Decyl Glucoside and Propylene Glycol part of Tinosorb M). If Tinosorb S and Polymethyl Metacrylate are on the inci list, probably Tinosorb S Aqua has been used. There's also a [Derma Sollotion SPF50](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/81-derma-sonnenlotion-lsf-50-sehr-hoch-5709954015218.html) version, which doesn't have a whitecast and has a similar base as the face version, but it is thicker and more shiny.

In my opinion however it is extremely shiny and it doesn't absorb well either, it looks like an oily sheen on your skin.

Because it's so thin and spreads around so easily I find it a bit hard to apply the recommended amount, it takes a few seconds but then it absorbs quickly but not to a matte finish, more a dewy finish, preservative free, most affordable sunscreen in this list.

Thicker gel-cream texture. Some people say it pills, but really this doesn't pill at all. I've tried very thick layers and applying it over other creams, but this doesn't pill at all. It is extremely sticky and extremely shiny however.

I really like the texture of this sunscreen, but for me it leaves a very, very visible whitecast (therefore the low rating), and it contains avobenzone unfortunately. The same formula is sold under the Aderma brand. There's also a comparable [Avene SPF50+ creme](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/creme-spf-50) version, that's slightly more hydrating, and [Avene SPF50+ milk](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/melk-spf-50-voor-kinderen) that's more budget friendly with almost identical ingredients, but it is more greasy than the emulsion.\n\n* [€10.60/50mL - Avene Sunsimed SPF50+/UVA31.8](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-solaire-sunsimed-very-high-protection-80ml/29945.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This products feels quite similar to the Avene Emulsion in my opinion.

The texture isn't very thin and doesn't spread very easily, I don't dislike that, it makes it easier to apply the recommended amount, it's not sticky and not very greasy. It isn't completely matte, although not too bad.

Airless pump. Lightweight gel-cream texture, spreads easily, dries down quickly, but not to a matte finish like the package seems to claim, the ss can pill a bit and it's a bit sticky. The nano titanium dioxide is double coated (Eusolex T-Easy), it's the only form of nano titanium dioxide that is stable enough to be combined with Avobenzone and Dihydroxyacetone (according the supplier). Does have some amount of grape seed extract, vitamin C and E and Q10. This version contains  Dihydroxy Methylchromonyl Palmitate, an ingredient that stimulates melanin production, increasing skins natural UV defences (again according the supplier). Most of the Face Sensitive and Body Sensitive have identical ingredients, so definitely look at the Ultrasun website under these 2 lines. The [SPF30 Family](https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Ultrasun-Family-SPF-30/28273011) is a more budget friendly option, with identical ingredients to the other untinted Ultrasun sunscreens.

Dries relatively quickly, not very greasy, these tinted versions are more matte and have a different texture than the untinted versions (see above), they don't pill as quickly as the untinted versions, but for dryer skin types also not very hydrating. It feels like there's sand scraping on your skin in these ss.

It doesn't cause any streaks or clumps, it's really the most invisible physical ss I've ever tried, easy to apply recommended amount. Even on lighter or darker skin tones than mine it's very invisible. I would have liked it to be slightly more hydrating, easier to rinse off and less shiny. And probably it has a low uva rating. I don't have the same problems as [HotandFlashy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-yL1Qvxg_U&t=12m49s) considering the shine, it isn't matte, but for normal to dry skin types quite oke.\n\n* [€31.7/50mL - Paula's Choice Resist Super-light Wrinkle Defense SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/sun-protection/_/Resist-Super-Light-Daily-Wrinkle-Defense-SPF-30)\n  * **Actives:** 13% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, darker than Coola/Neostrata, red undertone\n  * **Explanation:** slightly darker redder tint than Coola and Neostrata, this tint does look nicer on my skin, it's slightly darker than my skin tone, but it's not bad. It contains some very good actives like EGCG, resveratrol, Vitamin E, although concentrations are unknown. Goes on relatively easily, but takes more time to dry down than Neostrata and remains slightly sticky.  Does give a very matte finish, this sunscreen looks extremely nice, I even dare to say the best looking sunscreen I have ever tried. However for me it's very dehydrating, even with a thick moisturizer, therefore the low rating.

It does look very nice, but the tint is too dark for my skin, so in my neck and around my hair line there's a lot of color difference. Unfortunately it isn't very hydrating, although the bottle says its a hydrating sunscreen.

It contains Vitamin E and Green Tea Extract. It has a nice tint, but it's slightly too light/greyish which causes it to set in pores and lines, it gives a nice matte/dewy finish. It isn't very hydrating, and unfortunately it gives some minimal streaks and clumps.

(lip and baby ss non-nano).\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, yellow/brown\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  In summer the color is a bit too yellow/greyish for darker skin tones. It has a mousse like silicony feel, that spreads very easily on your face. It gives a nice skin like look, although on it's own it isn't really hydrating. If you apply a tiny amount this is the nicest physical sunscreen I've ever seen, but if you apply the recommended 1/4 tsp amount it simply doesn't dry down/absorb and it keeps laying on top of skin in streaks and clumps, and it takes very long times before it really dries down. I also wonder if the UVA protection is high enough.\n\n* [€28.30/50mL - Paula's Choice Calm Dry SPF30/Skin Recovery SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-recovery-daily-moisturizing-lotion-spf-30/146.html?cgid=category-sun-protection#start=3)\n\n  * **Actives:** 3.8% Titanium Dioxide (nano), 3.12% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** 3.5\n  * **Rating:** 5.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** does leave a very, very noticeable whitecast, personally I really like the texture and feel of the product, not very matte but suitable for combination skin. But even with foundation this still gives a kind of purple/white tint to skin. If it would come in a tinted version this would be good physical sunscreen, considering the actives, texture and skin feel.\n\n* See for other sunscreens I tried (but wasn't really impressed about) the [excel-sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EM9cHmBt_e4O8L0tU76nCYVfnSMuNW_j).\n\n \n\n**Notes**\n\nPersonally I find the Derma, Suncover, Noreva and Änglamark and Biodermal good, they are transparent and contain great sunscreen actives, but they are a shiny and some contain some pore clogging ingredients. In theory the Uncover Suncare, HighDroxy and Avene Emulsion are very good since they mainly contain Tinosorb M and Tinosorb S, but I don't really like the slight whitecast of these sunscreens. Ultrasun, Kruidvat and Uriage are also quite good, no extreme whitecast, nor very shiny. But they are also not matte and still have a slight whitecast. Elta MD and Paula's Choice Resist give a nice matte tint to the face, they really look great, but low uva protection and not very hydrating. \nSo a lot of good stable fragrance free sunscreens, but all of them do have some disadvantages here or there.\n\n\n> **Sunscreen actives** were most important to me when selecting sunscreens. I tried to select sunscreens with the following actives. Important factors for a sunscreen active is it's stability, possibility of skin reactions and free radical formation and if it penetrates skin. Testings for endocrine disruption are mainly done in vitro, I think it's effect is negligible in real life. For EU sunscreens with unknown UVA level, I give 1/3 of the SPF level with a \">\" sign:\n\n\n> * **Tinosorb S** - Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine - BEMT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb M** - Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol - MBBT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb A2B** - Tris-biphenyl Triazine (UVB+UVA2)\n\n> * **Uvinul T150** -  Octyl Triazone/Ethylhexyl Triazone - EHT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvasorb HEB** - Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone  - Iscotrizinol - DBT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvinal A Plus** - Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate - DHHB (UVA1+UVA2)\n\n> * **Mexoryl SX** - Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid - TDSA (UVA)\n\n> * **Mexoryl XL** - Drometrizole trisiloxane -DTS (UVB+UVA)\n\n> * **ZnO (coated)** - For US users in my opinion physical sunscreen actives are the best choice, all of the filters mentioned above are not allowed yet. I doubt there are many companies using true non-nano physical actives. The most common used patented physical actives used by the cosmetic industry have a median particle size under (nano) or just above 100 nm (non-nano). But with all these standard mixes, still a large part falls in the nano-range, and the stability of coatings and skin absorption over very long periods of daily usage is still questionable. The best option is to use coated zinc oxide.\n\n\n> * I don't really believe that antioxidants in sunscare work. Actives like Niacinamide, Licorice Extract or Green Tea Extract can be beneficial. The iron oxides in tinted products can help with protection against [infrared and visible light](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/606hwl/misc_how_much_truth_is_there_to_this_claim_on/df3v0la/). Although in my opinion it's often difficult to apply the recommendend amount of a tinted product in a way that it is invisible on skin.\n\n\n> All sunscreens are preferably free of:\n\n> * Oxybenzone,  Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate, Enzacamene\n\n> * Alcohol denat.\n\n> * Fragrance\n\n> * Irritating essential oils or plant extracts, like Eucalyptus, Mint, Citrus, Lavender, Bergamot oil etc.\n\n> * Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Diazolidinyl Urea etc\n\n\n> **Whitecast classification**: Since for me after ingredients, even a very slight whitecast is a big no for me, I made the following classification. **Do note that I apply 1.25-2.5mL, if you apply less, what most people do, almost all sunscreens will look great**.\n\n> * **0)** no whitecast\n\n> * **1)** no to barely visible whitecast. I would say 99% of the people won't notice any whitecast.\n\n> * **2)** slight whitecast. From this point you may notice, your skin may appear somewhat lighter. Most people would still consider this a sunscreen without a whitecast though. You can counteract the slight whitecast very easily with a small amount of foundation or powder, if you want.\n\n> * **3)** visible whitecast. This is what most people consider a sunscreen with whitecast. \n\n> * **4)** very visible, typical physical sunscreen whitecast. This is what you see with physical sunscreens from PC or from Badger for example.\n\n> **Shine**, order from most matte to least matte:\n\n> * Coola Matte, PC Resist, Neostrata, MUTI/Highdroxy, Avene Emulsion, Uncover Suncare, Ultrasun Tinted, Kruidvat Solait Face, Uriage Depiderm, Ultrasun untinted, Bioderma AR,Uncover Suncover, PC Calm Dry, Derma Ansigtcreme, Cotz Flawless Protection, Derma Sollotion SPF30/Rudolf Suncare,  Biodermal SPF50, Derma SPF50, Drs. Leenarts,  Mustela Bebe, Uriage Bariesun XP, Eubos Haut Ruhe SPF30, Badger SPF30 Tinted.\n\n\n> Physical sunscreens\n\n> * Although physical sunscreens are known for being non-sensitizing, stable and providing some protection against visible light, which are the main reasons why I still really like physical sunscreens, they were not my first choice, for three reasons. For me the **first** reason; I really don't want a sunscreen that makes my skin lighter than it already is, and physical sunscreens in my opinion all leave a whitecast when untinted. Most tinted version are simply visible on skin when you apply 1/4 tsp, and I don't like the thought that people might be thinking I'm wearing foundation as a guy. Physical sunscreens are just cosmetically less elegant than sunscreens with organic actives, they clump and streak. They are very difficult to rinse of your face as well. But of course YMMV. The **second** reason is that, as [KindofStephan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/50n4s5/lets_bust_some_sunscreen_myths_why_calling_them/)\n already pointed out, \"modern organic sunscreens have better UVA absorption (which results in higher UVAPF ratings) than can be offered by inorganic sunscreens\" . Physical sunscreens also mainly work by absorbing (~95%) UV radiation ([link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12214/abstract), [link](https://books.google.nl/books?id=rKHSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&dq=Textbook+of+Cosmetic+Dermatology+Inorganic+Filters&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS--Ok0IHUAhVNPFAKHUwQC1wQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Textbook%20of%20Cosmetic%20Dermatology%20Inorganic%20Filters&f=false)), so on that front there's not a huge difference with ingredients like Tinosorb M. The **third** reason is photocatalytic activiy of nano sized titanium dioxide. Most companies use nano titanium dioxide and nano zinc oxide, or anything with a median particle size just above 100nm to be able to sell it as a \"non-nano\" sunscreen, but then still a large parts falls in the nano range. These nano particles with todays knowledge appear to be safe, although long-term studies on daily usage are still scarce, the final EU Colipa report noted that trace amounts may remain in the sc, in hair follicles and sweat glands potentially over several days after application and washing. They may have photocatalytic activity and need very stable coatings. Colipa noted: \"It is less clear how stable the coatings are in final formulations. The particles were also found to induce oxidative stress in the cells indicated by a significant depletion of glutathione, induction of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation ([link](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_136.pdf)). “Part of the toxicity of nano ZnO is due to formation of reactive oxygen species, the impact in dermally applied cosmetic products is sofar unknown\" ([link](http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_103.pdf)). \n> \n>USA regulations are different than EU regulations. In the EU companies must declare if nano particles have been used on the ingredient list, where nano particles are defined as \"a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1nm – 100nm\". Thus a EU non-nano sunscreen can still contain a small percentage of nano particles. However in the US there is no definition of nano particles. Companies don't have to mention if they use nano particles, and are allowed to claim on their packaging what they want, they may refer to individual particles, agglomerates, different measurement techniques, since there are no guidelines or definitions for nano particles. Many \"non-nano\" USA sunscreens would have to be considered nano sunscreens according EU regulations.

        "body": "Because xanthan doesn't \"melt in your mouth\" it reduces perceived flavor, and tends to be snotty unless used in extremely moderate quantities. When you see it used in packaged products it's to add an extremely small amount of body to something that would otherwise be watery.\n\nThis is also true in different ways of most of your hydrocolloid options, if you can get your eyes on a copy of Modernist Cuisine they have a lot of useful info on the pros and cons of different products.\n\nFat emulsions are your best bet for flavor, but if you want to keep that emulsion and also have a thicker product, you want something that will release flavor in the mouth while being itself flavorless and add body without heavy dilution. Depending on how nerdy you want to get you can mix and match to fine tune the texture. \n\nI think the missing ingredient here is that all the standard sauce thickening techniques mentioned previously in this thread were originally devised for and usually used in conjunction with stocks. So if you want to really achieve that perfect silky wing coating glace-like sauce, it's pretty simple: I'd add gelatin. It's the original and best thickener, heavily gelatinized sauces emulsify beautifully when hot, release flavor easily at body temp, and it takes an insane quantity of gelatin to get to a texture anybody would find unpleasant.\n\nIt is impeded by acidity so you may need a significant amount.\n\nSince I probably way over-thought your design brief and have now written several unnecessary paragraphs, here is your TL:DR: cornstarch will have a great result, just do that.",

    "body": "Louisiana style hot sauces are the most common style sold in the USA. All five of these sauces are in the top ten when it comes to volume of sales and come with long and stories histories. Tabasco is the oldest continually operating hot sauce brand in the USA having first appeared on the scene in 1868 and is still made in Avery Island, LA. Frank’s Red Hot sold their first bottle of hot sauce in 1920 and despite their connection now with Buffalo, NY the company was founded in New Iberia, LA. Crystal hot sauce was founded in New Orleans, LA in 1923, and Louisiana brand hot sauce, also in New Iberia, in 1928. Texas Pete, despite the name, was founded in North Carolina in 1929.\n\nIn addition to all being founded in the 1920s (except for Tabasco) all of these sauces have similar ingredients consisting of aged cayenne peppers, vinegar and salt (with Frank’s Red Hot also including garlic powder) except again for Tabasco which uses tabasco peppers, a member of Capsicum Frutescens vs the cayenne pepper’s Capsicum Annuum. All are vinegar-forward sauces and, other than tabasco, saltier than the vast majority of craft hot sauces, though with their simpler flavor profiles these sauces are often used as an all-purpose seasoning to add both acid and salt to a dish.\n\nIn ranking these I was met with several surprises. While I’ve had all of these sauces in the past this was the first time I’ve tried them all back-to-back to really seek out the differences. Let’s get on with the rankings:\n\nNumber 1 Louisiana Brand Original Hot Sauce: Of all of the sauces this had the freshest and most prominent pepper flavor. Louisiana Brand Original Hot Sauce also has a great tanginess and overall a brighter flavor profile compared to the others of this style. Louisiana Brand ages their peppers for a minimum of one year which does help develop more complex flavors. It does have close to twice the sodium of all of the others at 200mg per teaspoon which is the only drawback. It was a very close call between this sauce and number two on the list, but the slightly thicker texture of Louisiana Brand which makes it better adhere to food eventually won out.\n\nNumber 2 Tabasco Brand Original Red Pepper Sauce: The original, the OG, the grand-pappy of them all Tabasco has been around longer than any of the others and is still the most unique of the style. Using Tabasco peppers, originally from Mexico but then later grown on Avery Island where Tabasco was founded this sauce is also aged longer than any of the others, for up to three years, and in white oak ex-bourbon barrels. The longer aging process gives Tabasco a funkier and more complex flavor and the use of the Tabasco pepper gives it a more aggressive quick bite of heat. This is also the best sauce for you if you’re watching your sodium intake – at only 35mg per teaspoon it’s far less than any of the others, and with the complex fermentation flavors you’d never miss the extra salt. The only drawback is the very thin texture which does make it difficult to use as a sauce, however it’s a plus for using it when mixing it in with soups or stews or into mixed drinks. I can’t have a bloody mary without a bottle of Tabasco at hand.\n\nNumber 3 Frank’s Red Hot Original: This one coming in here surprised my as I’d expected it to land at the bottom. Frank’s is often the butt of jokes as it’s so popular. After all if all the ‘normies’ like it, can it really be appreciated by hot sauce connoisseurs? What I found in tasting back to back is that Frank’s Red Hot is not only the darkest in color of all of these sauces it’s also the darkest in flavor. While Louisiana Brand is like a bright ray of pepper sunshine in your mouth Frank’s Red Hot is more like a peppery stormcloud. It’s not as fresh tasting as Louisiana but it has a nice depth, and the garlic element, while subtle, adds an extra dimension to the taste. Known as the original hot sauce used for buffalo wings I may have to give that a try with the rest of this bottle.\n\nNumber 4 Crystal Hot Sauce: Another surprise for me as I’d expected this one to come in first. I’ve long been a Crystal devotee but when tasted against the others I couldn’t help but notice a muted slightly ‘dusty’ taste in Crystal. It’s flavor profile is also less complex than Louisiana, Tabasco, or Frank’s Red Hot. Simple can be good if it’s fresh and flawless but the stale taste of Crystal compared to the others let it down. When combined with food the stale taste completely disappears so this sauce won’t go to waste, but I’ll be buying Louisiana Brand for my needs of this style going forward.\n\nNumber 5 Texas Pete Original Hot Sauce: Yet another surprise, I never expected this to come in last place. Close to 20 years ago I’d buy this sauce in big jugs and use it quite liberally, I loved it. Perhaps my taste buds have evolved or perhaps the recipe has changed but instead of the warm embrace of nostalgia this bottle left me with the bitter taste of disappointment. The only sauce in the list that uses artificial thickeners (xanthan gum) and artificial preservatives (sodium benzoate) this is the only sauce on the list that isn’t all natural. It has an unpleasant chemical flavor as well, no real freshness and no real depth to the pepper flavor. While numbers 1-4 on this list are all relatively close in performance Texas Pete jumped straight into the basement. A big shame for a sauce that I used to love.\n\nOverall I found tasting all of these together to be an enlightening experience, and it was fun to work out the subtle (and not so subtle) differences between a group of similar sauces. I’d like to do another Louisiana style write-up in the future with some of the more under-the-radar sauces of the style. I’m considering Trappey’s Red Devil, Frogbone Hot Sauce, Cajun Chef Hot Sauce, Slap Ya Mama Lousiana Style, and Paul Prudhomme’s Magic Pepper Sauce. If you have suggestions of others I should try, please let me know.",

Ive seen other apple butter recipes but I want to get a different consistency so that it solidifies like regular butter or a compound butter. I don't have a food processor, just a blender so I was going to blend them in water, strain, then reduce, cool, then whip with room temp butter. This will be for a savory waffle and I would like to quenelle it, so making it a spread is out of the question. Any advice would be much appreciated.also note that I have xanthan gum if that helps, don't know if I should use it for this. Thanks!\n\nUpdate: I tried it out my way, using apple juice to dilute the burnt apple puree so that it could strain through a coffee filter, then reduce. Due to reasons of my girlfriend having shit equipment the blend broke and plastic broke off into my puree. It was looking real good too with activated charcoal for a stronger \"burnt\" presentation. I'm definitely going to try this again doing it my way and the method described by u/HerpDerpinAtWork below, by fatwashing the butter in burnt apple... Extract possibly? Don't want to use the puree in case it emulsifies.. I'll report back when the day comes, for today I made Dill Butter for the final product https://www.reddit.com/r/CulinaryPlating/comments/l5rn8z/buckwheat_waffle_smoked_brunost_dill_butter_lox/",

I don't know if I would add water to it unless absolutely necessary. You don't want to dilute those rich flavors you worked so hard to make.

I have lost and gained 75 lbs over 7 years trying Paleo, keto, WW, Atkins, even carnivore. And sure, they all work! They all totally worked for about 3-6 months and then I'd hit a plateau or something would come along (get sick, stress at work, holidays, issues with kids or family) and I'd \"take a break\" that eventually would lead to me regaining everything. \n\nI'm here now because so far fasting gives me the weight loss (fat loss) I want with a bunch of added benefits like lower insulin, hunger control, more energy and brain boost...I love it. And right now it's really easy to just say \"don't eat now\" rather than \"what can I eat now?\" It's so nice to tell myself, just hang tight, you can have that later. Then later comes and I get a fairly substantial meal and no counting grams of this or weighing out portions of that. I don't have to go purchase expensive specialty ingredients anymore. When Thanksgiving rolls around, I'm going to eat turkey and gravy and pecan pie that my mom makes, not show up with my xanthan gum and Swerve.\n\nMy point is, I feel like a normal person again because I am giving myself permission to eat normal food! I am fasting so I can eat pasta some nights and have popcorn at the movies and have a beer on the weekend if I want. I eat veggies and protein too. I don't go bonkers like eating an entire bag of chips or scarfing down a whole container of ice cream. I just enjoy a good sized meal. I eat rice and potatoes again. I have a sandwich with actual bread. I am not stuck trying to convince myself that pork rinds work as good as tortilla chips in salsa. \n\nIs anyone else feeling good fasting while still consuming gluten and carbs? So far I am not having any problems and I am dropping lbs. Am I alone here? 😊🥖",

I like the way Peter Attia once framed eating habits as a series of levers towards the overall goal of caloric deficit - you can pull some combination of \"what you eat\" [low carb, low fat, vegan, paleo or otherwise], \"when you eat\" [fasting of all kinds including intermittent, extended, or otherwise], and \"how much you eat\" [calorie/macro/portion control for each meal]. \n\n- If you pull none of these levers, you're eating the \"standard american diet\" (SAD). \n- Some levers are easier for some people to pull than others - which one is easiest for you may not be easiest for someone else! \n- It's hard to pull two or three levers at once. Possibly doable in the short term as a treatment. \n- If you can strive to always pull one of these levers, you'll be further ahead in your eating habits (whether it's choosing certain foods, maintaining some kind of intermittent fasting, or tracking calories and macros etc) \n\nand we're all here because we're curious about the \"when you eat\" lever!",

In one instance it was deciding to be an early riser, taking up running, and training for a half-marathon. The switch to working-from-home also took like a year to get used to with kids and always being available for family dinners. It took extra willpower and a different mindset versus commuting to and from Manhattan, which made fasting easier. \n\nThat said, I think I've found a much better balance by figuring out how to get back into fasting under so many differing circumstances.

I have been in college in Rhode Island while family is in California, so I rarely visit, however I got an internship back home so I am staying with them for the summer, hence where the conflicts arise. Finding alternative housing is not an option financially.\n\nI am very into fitness and glean lots of joy from pushing my body to its limits. It is specifically a hobby of mine to cook/bake the best-tasting food possible with the greatest protein:calorie ratio. (I do not personally care about varying levels of carbohydrates vs fat, I have noticed no difference experimenting with varying levels). \n\nI eat 230-250g of protein per day and 2700-2900 calories to maintain my muscle and weight. Evidently I do not restrict my food intake- it is not as if my sister is seeing me eat like a bird. I have massive servings of egg whites, lean meat, vegetables, etc. \n\n The problem arises when I do not eat with my family when they eat things like pasta, cereal, bread, or go out to dinner. I have not eaten these things in years and I have no interest in doing so. I do not expect anyone to cook for me, however my mom will often make enough for everyone, and I will instead make my own food. (Thus, interaction in front of sister)“(Name) aren’t you going to at least try the (spaghetti/croissant/whatever)” “No thank you” \n\nI usually decline going out to restaurants but for unavoidable scenarios I say I am not hungry. \n\nMy parents have told me I am hindering my sister’s recovery by refusing to eat what they cook, not ordering food at restaurants, and by keeping food advertised as “low calorie”. Note that I have since got my own mini-fridge so my sister does not have to see the latter. However, my mom is still angry with me that I refuse to eat even a small serving of the food that she cooks for my sister (sister’s recovery program gives her little say in what she eats). Supposedly me declining food can trigger my sister.\n\nIn my defense, I can also be seen eating pancakes, ice cream, brownies, etc. They are just not the typical versions of those food. (ie, egg whites/protein powder/stevia/xanthan gum pancakes).\n\nQuick edit: \n\nIt is not as if my sister is on the verge of being hospitalized due to organ failure, she is at a healthy weight. (Not saying this to diminish anything, I am moreso getting at there isn’t an imminent risk of death/permanent injury, the issue is psychological/ mental health related)\n\nI am also 6’2 and weigh 200lbs, so I am not skinny, and thus not the physique my sister is trying to emulate.",

Eating disorders are often based on an unhealthy obsession with what you are eating/putting in your body that is ultimately rooted on a need to feel in control of one’s body. A separate fridge, separate meals, and particularly your fixation with a certain ratio are all warning signs to me. I’m sad to say eating disorders also can [run in families due to genetic predisposition](https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/a-better-understanding-of-eating-disorders-and-genetics/amp/). Not saying you have it, but you do have symptoms, and a family history. As with any medical condition you are symptomatic and at risk for, please please speak to a professional.",

I have been in college in Rhode Island while family is in California, so I rarely visit, however I got an internship back home so I am staying with them for the summer, hence where the conflicts arise. Finding alternative housing is not an option financially.\n\nI am very into fitness and glean lots of joy from pushing my body to its limits. It is specifically a hobby of mine to cook/bake the best-tasting food possible with the greatest protein:calorie ratio. (I do not personally care about varying levels of carbohydrates vs fat, I have noticed no difference experimenting with varying levels). \n\nI eat 230-250g of protein per day and 2700-2900 calories to maintain my muscle and weight. Evidently I do not restrict my food intake- it is not as if my sister is seeing me eat like a bird. I have massive servings of egg whites, lean meat, vegetables, etc. \n\n The problem arises when I do not eat with my family when they eat things like pasta, cereal, bread, or go out to dinner. I have not eaten these things in years and I have no interest in doing so. I do not expect anyone to cook for me, however my mom will often make enough for everyone, and I will instead make my own food. I usually decline going out to restaurants but for unavoidable scenarios I say I am not hungry. \n\nMy parents have told me I am hindering my sister’s recovery by refusing to eat what they cook, not ordering food at restaurants, and by keeping food advertised as “low calorie”. Note that I have since got my own mini-fridge so my sister does not have to see the latter. However, my mom is still angry with me that I refuse to eat even a small serving of the food that she cooks for my sister (sister’s recovery program gives her little say in what she eats). Supposedly me declining food can trigger my sister.\n\nIn my defense, I can also be seen eating pancakes, ice cream, brownies, etc. They are just not the typical versions of those food. (ie, egg whites/protein powder/stevia/xanthan gum pancakes).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

It also took me about 15-20 minutes to eat it as opposed to 2 minutes to down a shake.\n\nMy only issue is that filling to the max line caused an overflow and there was quite a bit of ice cream in and around the motor drill.

In large deep saucepan or skillet, sautee onions and garlic in oil\n2. add chicken stock, or water & bullion filling it about 1/3 to 1/2 way full\n3. add canned chipotles and chilis, bring to boil\n4. turn down to low before adding chicken, stacking it in the pan until it rises partially above the poaching liquid\n5. liberally spread chimichurri seasoning over the top, cover, and poach on low heat, not letting it boil, for an hour, or until a meat thermometer in the chicken reads 165. \n6. remove chicken and transfer to container\n7. turn up to high and boil it down, adding 1/16 to 1/8 tsp xanthan gum as a thickener if desired, reduce until thick and chunky, then pour over chicken.\n8. store in the fridge for up to a week\n\n**heating and serving**\n\n1. butter a small nonstick saucepan on medium-low heat, dollop in beans, spreading them with a greased spoon\n2. add chicken breast(s) topped with sauce on top, cover and simmer for 5-10 minutes or until chicken is hot\n3. transfer to plate and enjoy!\n\nEDIT: [Picture taken with a potato](https://i.imgur.com/pH409bF.jpg)",

After recording all the macros I was only able to eat such a small amount to stay under my net carbs for the day. All these recipes require almond flour, xanthan gum, stevia, erythritol and all this nonsense just to have a keto version of unhealthy foods. Dont get me wrong maybe this works for some but I would much rather just not be on keto and count calories if I needed these unhealthy foods in my life. I'm done trying to incorporate these keto substitute foods into my diet. I am just going to stick to my normal protein and greens. Keto isnt complicated I think if you really want to have pasta you can use zucchini as a substitute for noodles or something of the sort. To me keto is just a diet that restricts carbs. This means your diet should consist of veggies and protein maybe cheese or nuts. Dont trying to over complicate this diet. It's not as difficult, expensive, or time consuming as some people try to make it.",

I really appreciate that there are people out there testing out recipes and exploring new ingredients so that I can follow their lead. I'm cooking Christmas dinner this year for a bunch of non-keto people, and I'm really excited to put together a low-carb, delicious meal that my relatives and I can both enjoy. The only special things I need to buy are chopped pecans and sugar substitute, which isn't bad at all. Everything else--roasted pork, brussel sprouts, cauliflower mash--are things that I now cook on a regular basis.\n\nI have tried the fathead pizza and, like several others here have mentioned, find it to be too much trouble to do on a regular basis (especially when I can just melt cheese and pepperoni in a pan and scratch that pizza itch). But I am really glad it's in my arsenal, so that if I really, really, really want pizza, I can have it. When I've dieted in the past, I would sometimes focus on a particular food or food sensation, and nothing could sate that craving. I think that's what most of these recipes are for--when you are really craving brownies or something like that, you have an option that will still allow you to stick to this WOE. There's definitely a cottage industry that has sprung up around keto, which can be kind of annoying when it's just people trying to sell you stuff, but if that means it's possible for me to get Whisps at my regular grocery store so I've got a substitute for chips, I'm 100% okay with that.",

If you're trying to lose weight, keeping it simple and what works for you to stick to keto and maintain a caloric deficit always needs to take priority. \n\nBut I'm gonna take a somewhat opposite view here when talking about long-term sustainability....... \n\nThe truth is, there is some fantastic recipes out there that, while time consuming, are definitely worth making if you have the time (and especially for the holiday's.) The products that are coming out are not only getting substantially better  tasting, but the ingredients seem to be up to par as well. When i first started keto some 3 years ago, all of this was hard to come by. Keto is starting to have a significant effect on food culture which in turn makes keto infinitely more sustainable. \n\nTLDR: The newer recipes/products are a good thing and can make keto more sustainable-- as long as you maintain healthy eating habits.",

It would have been a lot better with protein powder and some sort of milk instead of water.  OP used a banana, which I would’ve used as well if one was on hand. I may use canned pumpkin down the road, or even apple sauce or spinach to give it more non-ice body.

I have two recipes that come out beautifully every time, and honestly taste better than any store bought bread I’ve found. They stay soft at room temperature for a few days, and freeze and toast after being frozen super well! The first one I have only ever made using a stand mixer. The second recipe says food processor gluten free bread, but I just mix in a regular mixing bowl and it comes out perfect. The second recipe has more of a “multigrain” taste and the slice size is a little smaller as it doesn’t rise as much. Sometimes I’ll put 1/2 tsp lactic acid powder in it to give it more of a sourdough taste. For both recipes, I’ve used olive oil, canola oil, avocado oil, all work great. I’ve used vitacost gluten free flour blend that contains xanthan gum, Bob’s Redmill 1:1, and King Arthur 1:1, and they all taste delicious!\n\nhttps://www.mamagourmand.com/best-gluten-free-bread-recipe/\n\nhttps://onlyglutenfreerecipes.com/recipe-items/food-processor-gluten-free-bread/",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

        "body": "Please do dermatology.... or fuck it both!! There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "I have been volume baking/cooking for quite some time now and have developed a few methods to reduce calorie count when baking. I will try to include everything, even the really obvious stuff, because you never know who is new to volume eating.  If I do forget something, or you have your own little hacks, please leave them down in the comments. These are in no particular order, just as I thought of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmond milk instead of dairy milk. Unsweetened is best but even the sweetened stuff tends to be less calorie dense than skim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSugar replacements can be substituted cup for cup for sugar if it is used just for flavor.  If you need to make a syrup, sugar replacement and xanthan gum works well.  If you need to use yeast, and there are no other simple carbs in the recipe, a teaspoon or two of sugar works just fine. For brown sugar, a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar for flavor and the rest should be sugar replacement. I have not tried this yet, but chances are you could replace brown sugar all together with sugar replacement and maple extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf a recipe calls for eggs, use liquid egg whites.  Three tablespoons is equal to one large egg. Egg whites are great for protein and add plenty of volume, especially when whipped into stiff peaks and folded in to whatever you're making (be gentle, though, or you'll lose all the volume).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth butter and eggs have a wide range of similar substitutes as they tend to have the same or similar use in a recipe. A quick google search will bring up plenty of results. My personal favorite substitute for butter is pureed pumpkin (pumpkin has more liquid so use 2/3 parts pumpkin for every 1 part butter. It has a nice subtle flavor but if you don't like pumpkin, it is easily overpowered by other, stronger flavors). If you want something more protein dense, Greek yogurt can be substituted for butter part for part. Depending on the substitute, chances are you will need to add more baking soda and/or baking powder and salt (though a pinch, this is important) to aid in leavening. Google knows more about this than I do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you absolutely need to use butter or shortening, I use imperial tub margarine which is 35 cal per tablespoon as opposed to 120 cal per tablespoon of butter/shortening. It is also the cheapest which is a bonus.  I recommend this for recipes that require you to cut in the butter/shortening such as pastries, biscuits, and flakey pie crusts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of the time, if a recipe calls for whole milk, light cream/half and half, cream, and even heavy cream (if it is not whipped), unflavored almond milk works just fine. Though, if you're replacing heavy whipping cream, you may need to add a couple of tablespoons on flour for thickening. It depends on the recipe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep macros in mind. Higher protein+fiber foods will keep you fuller longer and help keep calorie count low. Fat will also keep you feeling full, and a small amount is needed in a healthy diet, but the vast majority of the time, in my opinion, the calories are not worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtracts can be used in just about anything to add flavor without adding calories (or at least not enough to really matter). I even use water+butter extract when a recipe calls for me to sauté something in butter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOats can be great for volume in baking. Even if unsoaked, oats are 35 less calories per 1/4 c compared to all-purpose flour and are higher in protein and fiber too. However, they are not suitable for all recipes and are not a perfect flour replacement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal substitute for all-purpose flour is as such: one part all-purpose flour, one cup wheat flour, one cup wheat bran. A nutritional comparison:\n\n1/4c all-purpose flour: Cal: 110 Fat: 0g Carb: 23g Fiber: <1g Protein: 3g\n\n1/4 c replacement blend: Cal: 85 Fat: 0.2g Carb: 17.2g Fiber: 2.8g Protein: 3g\n\nSubstitute in equal parts, works in all instances (at least I haven't found a fail, and I bake a lot)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBonus recipe for those who have read this entire post:\n\nHomemade (oil-free) chocolate\n\n1/2 c cacao, carob, or cocoa powder\n\n1/4-1/3 c sugar replacement or to taste (optional for carob powder)\n\n1 c Almond milk (unsweetened, vanilla flavor is best)\n\nOptional: 1/4 t salt (helps bring out sweetness)\n\nOptional: 2 teaspoons instant coffee (for flavor, I always add instant coffee to every chocolatey recipe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlace all ingredients in a double boiler and mix until smooth. (I use a non-stick pan over a deep saucepan filled with water.)\n\nCook on med-low until very thick.  This will take a while.  Make sure to cook it long enough or it will get ice crystals when done. Make sure to stir constantly or it will burn.\n\nOnce well-reduced, pour into a freezer-safe container such as an icecube tray (find one that is very flexible as it may be difficult to remove later). I used a bowl lined with wax paper which worked fine.\n\nFreeze until hard. You can then break it into chunks, dice it into chips, shave it (though it melts fast), or keep it in a whole chunk. Tastes like dark chocolate but melts far faster and has a slightly grainy texture if eaten by itself. This is hardly noticeable (if at all) if incorporated into baked goods. \n\nI myself used cacao powder, but most of y'all probably don't have that so here's a calorie estimate for the entire recipe using cocoa powder: 150 calories for around 1-1.5 large solid chocolate bars worth of chocolate (most regular chocolate bars will be about 150 calories for 1/3 of a bar). The recipe will also have a lot of fiber and protein when compared to regular chocolate, 24g of each if memory serves me.",

No \"hints\" about it.\n\nThe calories come from your protein powder and actual cherries, you can adjust as needed to fit your goals. For example, 50 Cal of dark cherries is about half a cup.\n\n**Dark Cherry protein ice cream recipe**\n\n* 1 scoop (30g) vanilla protein powder\n* 0 calorie equivalent of 2 tsp sugar (I use Sugar Twin or erythritol)\n* 1 tsp lemon juice\n* 1/2 cup (70g) frozen or fresh dark cherries\n* 1/2 tsp xanthan gum or guar gum\n* Water (a bit less than 500ml)\n\n1. If your cherries are frozen, toss them in the creami pint and thaw in the microwave, we're going to make sure the cherry juices mix in really well with the rest.\n2. Mash the cherries a bit with a fork or pulse it in a blender just a bit to get cherry chunks and juice.\n3. Add the other ingredients with a splash of water and mix/whisk until there's no clumps, then add the rest of the water in 1 or 2 additions and whisk well.\n\nP.S. Don't skip the lemon juice ok, it prevents that cough syrup flavour I got your back.",

Poor girl hasn't had a chapter in a bit, what with all her new herbivore coworkers stealing the spotlight.\n\n[\\[First\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/12yfq9g/new_york_carnival_01_wherein_an_arxur_first/) \\- [\\[Prev\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1ftldka/new_york_carnival_45_research_and_development/) \\- [\\[Next\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1gjhz44/new_york_carnival_47_on_the_human_talent_for/)\n\n\\----------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: Chiri, Gojid Refugee**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: November 2, 2136*\n\nThe day passed methodically, each of us honing our craft until night fell and the proverbial dinner bell rang. On my end, I had a more intuitive grasp of Terran distilled spirits than I’d had yesterday, and on David’s end, the flatbread came out chewy and fluffy, and with some refinements, at least one and a half fillings were ready for market already. Two and a half, if you counted the pizza he’d made for dinner. David had informed me in no uncertain terms that the only correct way to eat pizza in New York was holding a slice folded up in one hand while either hunched over a counter or while walking. He was in the shower again--apparently all the sweating meant that humans needed to bathe daily, or they’d start smelling ‘off’--and I was trying my best not to drip tomato sauce and deliciously gooey cheese onto the rug of his reading nook as I browsed through his little library. Analog, too! It felt like I was in an antique store, seeing words laid out on bound paper. Of course, one of the upsides to digital media was the ease of translation. Still couldn’t read English, personally. Fortunately, I had a very helpful voice whispering secrets to me.\n\n*Me?* said the odd voice.\n\n*Obviously not,* said the critical voice. *You’re the embodiment of this ridiculous obsession she has with throwing herself as far from the Great Protector’s light as possible. I, on the other hand, am making her stronger, harder, and more able to survive these tumultuous times.*\n\nI meant my holopad’s AI assistant. You two aren’t even real.\n\n*That’s ridiculous,* the odd voice objected. *You’re perceiving me. That makes me real.*\n\nYou’re… inaudible, was the best counterargument I could muster.\n\nI quickly pulled my holopad out and asked for a summary of the books I was looking at before either of the voices could respond. The variety was surprising. Naturally, David owned a number of books on the culinary arts, including one on dry-aging root vegetables in mold, of all things, that he'd left out on a side table the other day. I don’t think he’d gotten around to reading it yet. But he also had books on art and philosophy, politics, business, and endless fictional stories of adventures and intrigue in fantastical realms. There were even a few books on…\n\n*Predator Disease,* said the critical voice, drawing my attention to a thick referential tome on the subject of the functions of the mind. *The human mind, specifically, but perhaps there was some overlap with the Gojid mind. You’ve been through a lot, lately. You should seek help.*\n\nMy quills flared in alarm against my best efforts. I took another bite of pizza, making sure to aggressively send along the delicious sensations of melty mozzarella and (admittedly plant-based) sausage slices at the critical voice.\n\n*Yes, I know,* she said. *That’s why I’m not telling you to seek help from a person. Any Predator Disease professional would have you locked up forever after your heinous food crimes. I’m suggesting we read a book on the subject and self-reflect a bit.*\n\n*That’s stupid and boring,* said the odd voice. *We’re already self-reflecting right now. You should read that other book on human magic. Deep down, everyone secretly wants to be a wizard. Maybe Terran magic actually works! We’d be fools not to check it out.*\n\nThe critical voice was stunned to flabbergasted silence. *That’s stupid and interesting,* she begrudgingly said at last. That still made it sound like a step up.\n\nMy AI companion scanned the label, and helpfully informed me that the centuries-old guide to divining the future using playing cards was, in fact, legally a part of the ‘public domain’, and she could therefore translate it for me for free. I was a bit fuzzy on the legal details, but it sounded like it was part of a museum piece showcasing Terran culture. Convenient, on the whole, considering I wasn’t pulling a paycheck yet.\n\n*You should still read something about mental health,* said the critical voice.\n\n*Do they have anything that’s in the public domain, about mental health, AND about magic?* the odd voice asked, excitedly.\n\nI repeated the voices’ queries aloud, and the AI assistant flagged a match. “Downloading ‘The Collected Works of Carl Gustav Jung’,” she chirped.\n\nI finished the slice of pizza I was holding, licked my pawpads clean, and listened to the AI assistant read my new books aloud to me. I was a few minutes into an overview of the Tarot when I started worrying about my boyfriend.\n\n*David’s been in the shower for a while,* the critical voice pointed out. *Do you think he’s okay?*\n\nAlmost certainly.\n\n*Counterpoint: he told you that humans who die in the bath smell like pork soup. Is that the last sensory memory you want to have of David?*\n\nI took a personal moment to scream internally, and then I paused my holopad’s playback and marched back up the vile staircase to the upstairs bathroom. “Hey, you alright in there?” I asked, sticking my head in.\n\n“Guh!” David exclaimed from behind the roar of water. “Yeah, I’m fine. Sorry, just zoned out.” He shook his head. “I was thinking about what might go with a chimichurri sauce. Something crispy, obviously, but that’s a big category, you know?”\n\nI had no idea what he was talking about, but the fact that he was talking was strong evidence that he was still alive. “You’ll get there. Happy to taste-test some prototypes tomorrow,” I said, leaving him to his musings. I flicked a command active on my holopad, and continued listening to some good old-fashioned Terran audiobooks. All journeys began with The Fool…\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: Chiri, Gojid Refugee**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: November 3, 2136*\n\nI sat at the bar, listening intently to my impromptu audiobook on the Tarot as I sipped at the cocktail I’d thrown together. Bamboo, it was called. Bamboo was a woodsy grass, generally, but the cocktail had nothing to do with it beyond being invented by someone who lived where it grew. Most Terran cocktails followed a straightforward pattern: a base spirit, plus various mixers to season it, like bitters, syrups, and fruit juices. The Bamboo cocktail did its own thing, rising up like an inexplicable weed. It was a mix of various odd strongwines and bitters. Sherry and vermouth? Ridiculous. It was a cocktail that would never work unless you understood the component ingredients, and I was starting to. It was a step further along on my journey.\n\n*Past the Fool lies the Magician,* said the odd voice. *The beginner’s luck fades, pale and weary, before the skill of those practiced at the craft.*\n\n“Oh shit, really?” said David, from the kitchen. Was he talking to me, or…? “That’s perfect! Yeah, I’m like right around the corner. I don’t have a truck, but I can set up a stand, sure. I’d love to be there. Toss my name in the hat, put in a good word, whatever it takes. Alright, thanks, bye.” He stepped out of the kitchen, looking excited. “Mets and Yankees are throwing an exhibition game to raise support for rebuilding the city,” David said, directly to me this time, and clearly expecting me to know what any of that meant.\n\n“Sorry, who?” I said.\n\nDavid blinked. “Right. Haven’t really covered baseball yet. Old American team sport that revolves around throwing a little ball around, hitting it with a stick, then running like hell. The Mets and the Yankees are the two big teams from New York. Buuuuuut…” He grinned. “Because it’s less damaged and closer to that new spaceport over at Floyd Bennett Field, they’re playing at *Maimonides* Park. That’s the Mets’, uh, trainee team’s field--again, go Cyclones--and best of all, it’s nearby. Honestly, with the intervening buildings down, you can probably see it from upstairs.”\n\nI *think* I knew the place he was talking about?\n\nI nodded slowly. “Alright, so what’re we doing there?”\n\n“Couple of local restaurants are stepping in and selling food there instead of the usual concession stands,” David said. “We *gotta* get on the list. First chance we have to make some money, *aaand*…” He paused to grin excitedly. “The first group of Yotuls will be there!”\n\nMy keen business sense pieced the puzzle together immediately. “We can debut our herbivore-friendly menu,” I said, but that was obvious. A little predatory thinking further and… “If we’re part of the first positive memory aliens have of Earth, they’re going to be hooked on us. We could pick up our first batch of regulars!”\n\n“Exactly! Assuming I can outcook the other stands,” said David, conspicuously trying to avoid looking more smug than usual. “Which… well, I’m not the *best* chef in New York City just quite yet, but unless the rest of the food stands are staffed by the entire fucking Michelin Guide, *I like my odds*.”\n\nI nodded. “Alright, you want me slinging cocktails, or…?”\n\n“Oh, definitely not,” said David. “Alcohol needs its own license to be sold. I have one for this building, not for random sporting events. I want you on front of house: taking orders and handling money.”\n\nAgain, I nodded. Straightforward enough. “What's my cut?” I said, smirking.\n\nDavid snorted. “You’re still legally not supposed to be here yet,” he said, wryly. “That makes it tricky to pay you directly. I can either gift you a third of net profits as a ‘present’, or I can grant you one wish.”\n\n*Think of all the things we could get with a wish!* the odd voice said, excitedly.\n\n*Most of the things we’d wish for can be purchased with a third of a day’s profits,* the critical voice said dryly.\n\n“I wish for *half* of the net profits,” I said, smirking.\n\nDavid laughed. “Fine. It’s one day, and it’s more about getting our name out there than anything else. I can spare it. Make sure to look your cutest.”\n\nI glared at him playfully. “I am *always* at maximum cuteness!”\n\n\\----------------------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: Chiri, Gojid Refugee**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: November 4, 2136*\n\nI sat on the seashore, listening to my audiobooks, wrapped up in a warm jacket over my own fur. David was inside the stadium or whatever, behind me, negotiating the details of where we’d set up our food stand. I still didn’t enjoy watching him argue with people, and negotiations were arguments where there was money on the line. I was keeping a spare eye on Toki, who was frolicking in the sand, though that placed my other eye tilted over at the ruins of Luna Park.\n\n*The Moon, the hidden world,* said the odd voice. *The other you, the reflection below the surface of the water. This was where your rebirth began. Your self-inflicted baptism in Earth’s seas. It was over there that you and I first spoke. And look at you now!*\n\nI glanced down at myself in confusion. The… the jacket?\n\nThe odd voice sighed and shook its head. *How do I teach this girl?*\n\nThe critical voice chimed in, baffled, but trying her best. *I mean, credit where credit’s due, you’re doing a lot better than a few days ago. Place to live, a job, a plan going forward… even got a bit of a mentor/lover thing going on with a local. I hate to say it, but this whole “Let’s become a mighty hunter” thing seems to have paid off for us.*\n\nI was prepared to leave it at that, and savor the sense of ‘Glad you see it my way, finally,’ but the odd voice chimed back in. *Yes! That’s the hero’s journey. The human monomyth, as laid out in the Tarot.*\n\nI’d had some thoughts, but this was the first time I’d really considered trying to put the whole puzzle together. “What do you mean?” I said, aloud.\n\n*Our hero begins as a Fool, a plucky doofus who knows nothing. She faces the call to adventure, stumbling, relying more on luck and determination than skill. Then she encounters the Magician, a mentor figure who teaches her the skills she needs to survive.*\n\nThe critical voice chimed in. *Sure, fine, and the next four cards--Priestess, Hierophant, Empress, Emperor--represent inexplicably gender-coded mastery of the spiritual and physical worlds, respectively. When did we tick all of* ***those*** *boxes?*\n\nDavid probably was serving double-duty as the Magician *and* some of the masculine archetypes, but the Empress, worldly feminine power… I hadn’t really spoken to that many women lately. David’s cousin’s wife, the lawyer Erin Brenner, maybe? I still had some feelings to unpack there--mostly a sense of inadequacy--and I didn’t care to do so right now.\n\n*Not every journey has to hit* ***all*** *the cards,* said the odd voice. *Next are the tests of character. The Chariot, the Lovers, Strength, Temperance… all the challenges of virtue and choice a budding young hero might encounter.*\n\nThe critical voice was unmoved. *We’re not going through all twenty-something of the Major Arcana and pretending they have life lessons specific to us. That’s ridiculous. Also, you’re ignoring the minor arcana. What does the Three of Cups mean to us?*\n\nThe odd voice bristled like she was aghast. *The Three of Cups represents community and emotional support. You know, like we’re cultivating here on Earth? Gods, were you not paying attention to the audiobook at all?*\n\nThe critical voice snorted. *I was not paying attention, correct. I was monitoring sensory data for threats, which is my fucking job. Keep us alive, not indulge in these ridiculous fantasies. You want fantasies? Fine: Fortune, representing the vagaries of fate beyond our control. The Tower, representing ruin. See? I was listening during the big parts. But the better question is, if this is meant to be ordered, why are those cards, representing the loss of our home and our culture, earlier in our journey than the Fool?*\n\n*The Campbellian Hero’s Journey doesn’t always hit every plot beat, and doesn’t always happen in the same order!* the odd voice shouted. *Recall, one of the classic calls to adventure is the ruined hometown. We never would have left the Cradle if it hadn’t fallen. We never would have begun our journey. We never would have become what we were always meant to be!*\n\n*We were meant to be a distiller at the family orchard!* the critical voice shouted. *We were meant to be good little herbivores living in safety and security!*\n\n*We were not meant to live in a comfortable lie!* the odd voice shouted back.\n\nI rubbed my head in frustration. I was starting to feel warm, like a computer that was running too hot. I knew the voices were just me--just my overactive imagination parsing out my thoughts socially, like a herd within--but this was… all my intrusive thoughts going into overdrive at once.\n\n*You’ve been bottling them all up the past few days,* said the critical voice. *You have to process things from time to time, Chiri.*\n\n*Especially when you’re binge-reading about mysticism and what thoughts can represent,* the odd voice agreed.\n\nAnd what do you two represent?\n\n*We’ve been over this,* said the critical voice. *I’m your self-flagellating side. Telling you to be better, stronger, and more able to stay alive.*\n\nThis predatory stuff has been making me stronger. You’ve admitted it. Why are you still hammering on the idea that I need to be a good little herbivore?\n\nThe critical voice recoiled like she hadn’t been expecting an argument. *You’re… you… this is what we’ve learned for the first twenty-seven years of your life. Sue me for falling back on old reliable habits. These are the instincts that have kept you safe.*\n\nThese are the instincts I’ve been repressing because they’re what I’ve grown to hate about myself!\n\nI blinked, and sucked in a breath of chill ocean air. I’d heard that phrase before. That… that had been in Jung. Different aspects of your personality and psyche--the Anima and Animus, various ideas and concepts of other people out in the world… and the Shadow. The things you hate about yourself, and try desperately to visualize as separate from you. You know. Like an external voice you could talk to.\n\nYou’re my Shadow, I thought.\n\nThere was a sound of disgust and defeat. *If that’s how it’s gotta be,* Shadow grumbled. *Think of me however you like, just never stop listening, or it’s* ***both*** *our asses on the line.*\n\nI nodded, and turned my thoughts to the other voice. What in the world are you, then?\n\nThe odd voice was quiet and contemplative for a bit. Silence inside my head, and outside of it, the sound of the ocean, and the ruins of Luna Park in the background of my field of vision.\n\n*I’m the other you, I think,* said the odd voice. *Dream and reflection. Musing about what could be and what could have been. Something new to you, and something very old.*\n\nI recalled the last stretch of the Tarot. Past the ruin of the Tower lay the Star, guiding us onwards towards where we needed to be. And next came the Moon, which represented… dreams, reflections, and introspection.\n\n*What’s the old word for Earth’s moon?* asked Luna, answering her own question. *In which park did we first speak?*\n\nI nodded decisively. Luna was a pretty name.\n\n\\--------------------\n\n**Memory Transcription Subject: Chiri, Gojid Bartender**\n\n*Date \\[standardized human time\\]: November 7, 2136*\n\nBack at the bar, I cradled a vegan Ramos Gin Fizz as I started making notes to myself about potential unique cocktails I could serve… or even bottle and can for my own enterprise. I’d picked up so many techniques and recipes over the past few days. The cocktail beside me was proof of my burgeoning skill: it mixed lemon, lime, and dairy, which could curdle itself in the citric acid if I mixed it in the wrong order, plus I needed to substitute it out for a dressed up coconut cream so any of our Yotul customers might buy it. Then it was topped up with the foam from a frothed-up egg white, which would kill me, so David had walked me through the process of using tinctures of *aquafaba*\\--the water used to cook beans in, of all things!--and some curious powder called xanthan gum to keep it extra foamy. It was one of the most complicated cocktails I could find a recipe for, and it was… not my masterpiece, but my journeyman’s piece. Proof that I was a bartender in full.\n\nI was scribbling my inspirations away with a pen on paper, like the olden days--it was going to be another few days before my holopad would finally get the update for the Gojid language and alphabet, so I was roughing it a little bit to get by--when David received another phone call. I ignored it for the moment, since I was really drilling down into some of the most interestingly fruity flavors I could muster without just resorting to drowning things in juice, but David marched into my section of the restaurant with another excited look on his face.\n\n“Good news about the baseball game?” I guessed.\n\nDavid did a double-take. “Huh? Oh, no, that’s all settled. Good news about your visa paperwork. It’s almost done, with one little exception: you have the right to formally change your name, if you like.”\n\nI recoiled. “What? I like my name. Do you *not* like the name Chiri or something?”\n\n“What? No, that’s not what I mean,” David said, startled. “Sorry. I meant, humans typically have two names. I wasn’t suggesting you ditch Chiri, I was asking if you’d like to pick a second name. Like a family name?”\n\nI sat fully upright on the barstool. “Now that… that’s an interesting question,” I said, noncommittally. “Hadn’t really considered it much. How, uh… if I wanted to pick one, how would I go about it?”\n\nDavid rubbed the light fluffy brown fur on his chin. He typically preferred to shave it clean, but he’d been really focused on his recipe research for the past few days and had been skipping some minor grooming. “Well, there’s a couple different styles of surnames, as I understand it. Professional names are pretty common. Descendents of a metalworker might call themselves Smith or Schmitt or something, which is pretty common. A barrel-maker might go by Cooper.”\n\n“What’s the name for a distiller?” I asked.\n\nDavid stared at me, deadpan. “Brenner.”\n\nI blinked. “Right! Yes, you mentioned that. Okay. Umm… what about a bartender?”\n\nDavid shrugged. “Not sure. That’s kind of a modern profession. I don’t know if there is one.” He waved his hands around to search for that information online. “Internet says Taverner is allegedly a name, but I’ve never heard it spoken before. Maybe Chiri Vintner, for a family who owned a winery?”\n\nI didn’t much care for the ring of that. “Ehh, I’m not feeling it. Are they all profession names, or…?”\n\n“Nah, there’s also descriptors and place name,” he said. “Brown is a common surname. Chiri Brown?”\n\nI made a face. “It’s got a ring to it, I guess, but Brown describes *every* Gojid. Place names, though?”\n\nDavid thought for a moment. “Uh, sure. I think that’s more common out East? Like, most Japanese surnames follow basic descriptors for where they’re from. Kimura, for example, is something like ‘from the village with the trees’. In the west… I dunno. I guess landed gentry sometimes named themselves after their ancestral estate?”\n\n*We have an ancestral estate,* Luna pointed out.\n\n*Had,* said Shadow bleakly, *but the name is still there.*\n\nI nodded. That would work. “My ancestral estate was Garnet Orchards,” I said. “How does Chiri Garnet sound?”\n\nDavid savored the taste of it like a sip from one of my experiments. “You know, I kinda like it.” He smiled, and held his hand out. “Pleasure doing business with you, Miss Garnet.”\n\n“The pleasure is all mine, Mister Brenner,” I said, grasping his hand in my paw.",

I fried them in coconut oil for a more traditional donut texture. I would highly recommend doing them in a fryer if you have one or using a thermometer to check the temperature because it can be a bit tough to get it right to where they cook perfect if you don't have one! (I did not have a thermometer and it was a slight challenge, LOL).\n\nAnyways hope you guys try these out. They are made with vital wheat gluten so just be sure to avoid this recipe if you are celiac or gluten-intolerant. Otherwise you are good to go! (See [my article on Vital Wheat Gluten](https://mouthwateringmotivation.com/2019/12/03/is-vital-wheat-gluten-keto/) if you are curious about this ingredient)\n\n\\*I'm actually working on a gluten-free version of some of my favourite keto dough recipes currently so hopefully I can give you guys a good alternative soon! :)\\*\n\nHere is the full Keto Apple Fritter recipe with step-by-step photos, tips and a printable copy: [https://mouthwateringmotivation.com/2020/05/14/keto-apple-fritters/](https://mouthwateringmotivation.com/2020/05/14/keto-apple-fritters/)\n\n## Keto Apple Fritters\n\n## Serves: 15 small apple fritters\n\n## Ingredients:\n\n**Donuts**\n\n* 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp coconut flour, 63g\n* 1/2 cup almond flour, 56g\n* 1/2 cup granular monkfruit/erythritol sweetener, 96g\n* 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten, 40g\n* 2 tsp baking powder\n* 1 tsp xanthan gum\n* 1/2 tbsp cinnamon\n* 1/2 tsp nutmeg\n* 1/2 tsp allspice or ginger\n* 1/8 tsp salt\n* 1/2 cup half and half, light cream or heavy cream (I used 18% cream in Canada) , 120g\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 tbsp coconut oil, melted, 15g\n* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 granny smith apple, chopped into small chunks, \\~180g\n* 2 tsp butter, 10g\n* 1 tbsp granular monkfruit/erythritol sweetener \n* Extra 2 cups coconut oil for frying, 480g\n\n**Glaze**\n\n* 3/4 cup powdered monkfruit/erythritol sweetener, 144g\n* 1/4 cup half and half, milk or light cream, 45g, don't use heavy cream or it will end up too thick\n* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\n## Directions:\n\n1. In a bowl, combine all of your dry ingredients including the sweetener. \n2. In another bowl, whisk together your cream, eggs and vanilla extract.\n3. Add the wet mixture to your dry ingredients, stir, then add your melted coconut oil as well.\n4. Mix until a thick batter forms. Set aside.\n5. Add your oil to a large wok and begin to heat it over low-medium heat \\*(if you have a thermometer, the temperature should be around 350-375\\*F)\n6. Meanwhile, heat a small frying pan over medium heat as well along with your butter. Let the butter cook until it begins to turn a slightly golden colour.\n7. Once golden, immediately add your apples and sauté until they are tender but still with some crunch to them. Add your 1 tbsp of sweetener and toss to coat. \n8. Add your apples to your batter you made earlier and stir until combined. \n9. When your oil has come to temperature, drop spoonfuls of batter into the oil and slightly flatten it with a spoon to help it cook evenly. (I'd recommend a test donut before you go and do a bunch, see my tips on how to check if your oil is ready/hot enough).\n10. Cook each donut for 1-2min per side or until dark brown but not burnt. \n11. Use a slotted spoon to pick the donuts up and place them on paper towel to drain the excess oil, then move them to a wire rack to cool.\n12. To make the donut glaze, whisk together the three ingredients in a bowl until smooth!\n13. Drizzle the glaze over each donut. (I leave mine on the wire rack and place that over top of a baking sheet to catch the excess) Let the glaze set for a couple minutes, then serve warm or store in an airtight container for later!\n\n**Nutrition for 1/15th of recipe: 129 calories | 9.7g fat | 3.6 NET carbs | 4.4g protein | 2.2g fibre**",

It comes with a recipe guide and there’s a repository of user created recipes online so the sky’s the limit.\n\nPro tip - don’t overfill the pints, add a pinch of salt and spices to improve flavour, use a combination of allulose, beef gelatin and alcohol to reduce ice crystals and improve consistency. As for mix ins - nuts, sugar free chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate work well.  If the initial cost of the machine is in your budget, buy a few extra pint containers and if you’re used to buying sugar free or keto ice cream, you’ll recoup your costs in no time. Good luck!",

You can't do the usual high heat canning/bottling because it will break the emulsion. \n\n\"Mayonnaise, salad dressings, ketchups and comparable products are preserved by a combination of low pH (adjusted by acetic and citric acid), low aw (mainly depending on the relative levels of oil, water and salt in the formulation), and – sometimes – preservatives such as sorbic and benzoic acids. The target pH value depends on the level of other inhibitory factors such as aw [water activity] and the presence of preservatives, but is generally about 4.0. In contrast to ketchups, emulsion-type products cannot be pasteurized after mixing. When designing the formulation of the latter products, one must take into account the partition coefficient of the preservative agents between the water and the oil phase.\"- from [Food Preservation Techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781855735309/food-preservation-techniques)\n\nYou might get more detailed/expert advice from r/foodscience.",

Mayo should be at 4.1 pH or below, which is considered \"acidic.\" I think below 4.6 is the normal definition for an acidic food, so mayo definitely qualifies.\n\nMost of the salmonella outbreaks caused by mayonnaise in the 50s and 60s were from pH being too high and bacterial growth commenced.\n\nPowered citric acid is an easy way to acidify without adding too much water content, and would still be a natural ingredient.\n\nAs for how much / how long / how shelf stable - definitely send your stuff out for testing! I know from the beer industry, there are labs that you can send your finished or unfinished product to and they can test for all sorts of contaminants, so you can be sure what you're producing is stable, safe and quality. It's not all that expensive either. My buddy works at a brewpub that only distributes in cans (aside from kegged in their actual pub) in about a 100mi radius, and they send out cans about every 3 months to be tested, and adjust their processes as needed. I'm sure there's similar services for small time food producers.",

As Mayo is packed cold, it is essential to control recontamination from yeasts, mold, and certain heterofermantitive lactic acid bacteria. The formulation of the mayo (reduced water activity and reduced pH) provides most of the VP & SP hazard control. Commercial mayo production micro quality is assurred by using a continuous and closed manufacturing process, for this pasteurized product, that is sterilized at the start of the run. The success of your opportunity for re-packing mayo will be largely dependent on maintaining the microbial integrity of the supplied mayonnaise as your facility handles it, of which the package sterility is just one point of concern.”\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.ifsqn.com/forum/index.php/topic/19802-bottling-mayonnaise-microbiological-hazards/",

Most products that claim to mend split ends don’t have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here’s the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That’s fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there’s a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don’t let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don’t let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there’s some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can’t tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

Examples of petty reasons I haven’t purchased something:\n\n-It’s in a dropper bottle\n\n-It’s in one of those dumb wide mouth jars (looking at you facetheory)\n\n-The branding is over-the-top cutesy or childish (e.g. Elizavecca)\n\n-They advertised the product as “clean”\n\n-They advertised a useless but fancy sounding “hero ingredient” even if it’s not actually the ingredient doing the heavy lifting. For example, it’s an effective soothing serum with niacinamide 2% and panthenol 1% but it’s called “Calming Emulsion with Hokkaido Lily and Babassu Water” 💀\n\n-The name of the brand triggers anti-aging anxiety (Age 20’s, Youth to the People, etc)\n\n-They used annoying overly complicated scientific terms in the product description to seem “high tech” e.g. “rheology modifier” instead of “thickener” - for freaking xanthan gum 😂 (cc NIOD, The Ordinary, facetheory…)\n\n-Their men’s line formulas are identical to the lines marketed to women, but cheaper. Looking at you Clinique. I don’t care if I can technically just buy the men’s product, I’m offended by the capitalist cynicism/exploitation of your core customer base.\n\nETA: this new trend of marketing skincare as “unisex”..(???) All OTC skincare is unisex, AFAIK there is no OTC spironolactone or similar…\n\nETA2: any product name with an overwrought euphemism à la “lip gelée,” “skin drink,” “hydrating glaze,” “eye custard.” It’s a fucking moisturizer/toner/gloss!

Dude, I'll know what's not in it WHEN YOU STOP VIRTUE SIGNALLING AND JUST LET ME SEE WHAT *IS* IN IT.\n\nIt also depends on the degree of marketing. If it's just like, an FYI (like, \"Hey, for you folks who care about it, we're clean or don't have parabens or whatever\") then I basically just ignore it because most brands have to do some clean beauty pandering these days, but if it's a core marketing theme, I find it too annoying to stomach. If I'm rolling my eyes every five seconds while trying to read the product description or even just trying to navigate your website to find a product, then I'm probably not going to be in the mood for spending money lol\n\nI'm also funky about packaging, but I'm actually sort of the opposite to you. While I'll buy outside of my preferences if there isn't a better product, I generally like packaging that allows me to very easily get every last bit of product out with minimal effort. If I have to turn into a bloody mechanic to get to the last of the product, I don't want it lol. This means that I love jars and droppers — just stick your finger in or turn it upside down and voila! \n\nThe gendered stuff gets me, too! Gendered skincare lines that fail to address issues that may be specific to one gender irritate me anyway (for example, a line of skincare that just smells differently depending on the marketing vs. a line of skincare that has products that were formulated to apply well if you have a beard) but I level up to \"kind of pissed off\" when the pricing bs happens. It's so silly.\n\nSomething that's probably going to be very region specific but that I'm sure some will relate to is any product or brand marketed for whitening, regardless of whether or not it has ingredients that could theoretically do that.

    "body": "Edit: Wow, thank you everyone for the really nice awards and kind comments. I’m so glad I was able to help some of you! This took me a few days to start writing and ruminate on, so I’m really glad it seemed worth it for a lot of people. I’ll try to keep this going in for future major Ipsy skincare items! I’m about to get really busy in a month but I’ll do what I can! ❤️\n\nHey all,\n\nI've been seeing a lot of  posts about the Cryo ATP Sports Booster serum and how people don't know what it is exactly supposed to do... it doesn't help that the official 111Skin's description for it is just filled with nonsensical marketing bullsh\\*t. Considering the huge price tag, I think we're all feeling a lot more curious about it than most serums that wind up in our bags. As I'm reluctantly receiving this in my bag (Ipsy chose it for me), I'm putting in some time to figure it out.\n\n**Objective & Disclaimer:** Let's put aside the pseudoscience jargon used in 111Skin's description and try to figure out what the serum itself should do for your skin. I'm not an expert *in any way* but I'm a skincare enthusiast... I thought maybe it might be worth posting an interpretation of what this serum is formulated to do, since it appears the company itself fails to say anything useful at all on their website. At the very end of this, I'll explain how I think this product got its name. Again, I'm not an expert so if anyone knows better or has their own input feel free to chime in!\n\n**Product description per** [**official webpage**](https://111skin.com/products/cryo-atp-sports-booster): \"Mimicking the effect of extreme cold on the skin, this booster contains natural cellular energy, ATP, to encourage more oxygen for optimised cell function. Just a few drops of this highly-charged formula will reignite lacklustre skin, leaving it tightened, toned, and refined for a reinvigorated complexion. Perfect for use post-workout, this booster will prolong freshness for enlivened and refreshed skin.\"\n\n**Ingredients list**:  Aqua / Water / Eau, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester, Ribose, Acrylates Copolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Carbomer, Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Tromethamine, Adenosine, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Adenosine Triphosphate, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Fragrance / Parfum.\n\nOK, now let's break it down \\[key ingredients in **bold**\\].\n\n* **#1 Water**\n* **#2 Glycerin--** this is a humectant, meaning it attracts water into the skin and helps with hydration. The fact that this is #2 tells you that this should be a moisturizing serum.\n* **#3 Niacinamide--** I'm pleased to see that this is #3 in the ingredients list-- and I believe this should make the biggest difference in the serum for most people that aren't already using niacinamide. It's essentially a niacinamide serum with a lot of other bells and whistles. Niacinamide  (aka vitamin B3) is a really common ingredient that is non-irritating to most people but can cause some stinging sensation for some. It evens out skintone, reduces appearance of pores, evens out skin texture (ie, reduces congestion), and boosts ability for moisturizers to work (and thus is wonderfully paired with glycerin).  Most people that aren't already using a serum or some kind of special moisturizer might not have niacinamide in their routine, which is why I think this'd be the most \"groundbreaking\" ingredient for those that aren't already using it. It's the key ingredient that is the reason people rave about the Peach and Lily's Glass Serum which is essentially a niacinamide and hyaluronic acid serum. But here's the catch-- all these benefits won't happen overnight. It needs to be used consistently over a period of at least a week, but likely much longer than that, to start showing effects. Here's a great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qd7J1UNGUo&t=909s) by Dr. Dray, a real dermatologist, that explains benefits of niacinamide.\n* \\#4 Butylene glycol-- a solvent so ingredients that don't dissolve well in water can be more evenly spread out in the serum\n* \\#5 1,2-Hexanediol-- a preservative\n* \\#6 Betaine-- a humectant\n* \\#7 Polyglycerol-10 Laurate-- skin softener\n* \\#8 Phenoxyethanol-- a preservative\n* \\#9 Caprylyl Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#10 Vp/Polycarbamyl Polyglycol Ester-- I actually don't know what this is and can't find an immediate Google answer\n* **#11 Ribose-**\\- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It apparently [might play a role](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3047922/) in helping boost collagen production. \\[[Another source](https://www.oskiaskincare.com/skin-nutrition/patented-actives/ribose/#:~:text=Riboxyl%20or%20Ribose%20is%20a,naturally%20in%20all%20living%20cells.&text=It%20is%20the%20only%20known,new%20energy%20to%20tired%20skin) that explains the mechanism a little bit.\\]\n* \\#12 Acrylates Copolymer-- a microplastic for enhancing texture of product\n* \\#13 Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer-- thicken product, enhances texture of product\n* \\#14 Carbomer-- thicken product\n* \\#15 Hydrolysed Sesame Protein Pg-Propyl Methylsilanediol-- skin tightener\n* \\#16 Pentylene Glycol-- a humectant\n* \\#17 Tromethamine-- a pH adjuster\n* **#18 Adenosine**\\-- a component of ATP, which helps explain the product's name. It [might play a role](https://koreanskincaretips.com/adenosine-in-skincare/)in helping boost collagen production (and thus can may have anti-wrinkle properties).\n* **#19 Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil**\\-- offers a cooling sensation upon application, and I suspect is the reason 111Skin relates this product to cryotherapy... even though it has nothing to do with it. It might feel nice on the skin at first for people that aren't immediately irritated, but it can be an irritating ingredient to those with sensitive skin. This might be why some people are saying that they're seeing some redness after application. In the long term it's a sensitizing ingredient. Don't continue its use if you find your skin is irritated upon application. Edit: I should’ve researched this more, but it seems eucalyptus oil also has antiseptic, anti inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which are all good things. However, it’s also not recommended by a lot of dermatologists due to how easily it can irritate skin for some people. (This is the case for many essential oils.)\n* \\#20 Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer\n* **#21 Adenosine triphosphate**\\-- ATP itself and gives the serum its name. This [L'oreal webpage](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/ingredient-library/atp.aspx) succinctly describes what its supposed to do in skincare.\n* \\#22 Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract-- skin soothing properties\n* \\#23 Xanthan gum-- for product texture\n* \\#24 Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil-- an emollient\n* \\#25 Fragrance/parfum-- the yummy smells and potential irritant\n\n**Interpretation**: There's a fair amount of humectants in this serum, with glycerin being #2 right after water. That can be promising for people with dry skin. Right after glycerin is niacinamide, which if you don't know is a holy grail ingredient for a lot of products. Anyone that doesn't already have this in their routine but has textured skin, irritation, uneven skintone, or enlarged pores, may benefit the most from this serum. Note that the positive effects of niacinamide will take weeks to show, so don't expect this to work overnight! Unfortunately niacinamide can cause some stinging sensation for some people which can be off putting. The \"*cryo*\" part in the product name is thanks to the eucalyptus oil, which gives a cooling effect on the skin upon application. Really, it doesn't serve any substantial service. Maybe some people will find it temporarily soothing but those with sensitive skin, it is a major irritant and a sensitizer. Lastly, the \"*ATP*\" portion of the name-- there's ribose, adenosine, and adenosine triphosphate in the serum. These ingredients are supposed to interact together to promote rejuventation, whatever the hell that means. From the webpages I've linked, it seems these three ingredients should promote collagen production within the skin, which should help battle wrinkling and dullness of the skin.  I haven't delved too deep into the studies that show its efficacy but if someone else wants to do that, please share with us what you find! As for why this product has \"*sports*\" in the name? ...Uh, because the eucalyptus oil might feel good on hot skin post-workout, and something about adding ATP onto one's skin will supposedly help restore ATP that is supposedly used up during the workout?\n\nAnyway, overall I'm optimistic about this serum for people with non-sensitive skin. The eucalyptus oil and fragrance/parfum added might be too much for some of us to handle, but for those that can handle it and that don't have a robust skincare routine yet, I'm optimistic that the niacinamide can make a difference for a lot of people. Do I think it's worth the price tag because of that though? Nope. There's a lot of affordable niacinamide serums out there-- off the top of my head, The Ordinary's niacinamide + zinc serum \\[<$10\\] and Peach and Lily's glass skin serum \\[<$40\\] are the holy grails for so many people. (The glass skin serum is my own HG for fixing my textured skin.) As for the ATP components of this serum... without looking more into efficacy studies I'm not sure if it'll do anything on that front. If anything, the niacinamide should visibly address the things that the ATP ingredients should supposedly  be taking care of. As long as it isn't harmful, then, ah well why not, I guess.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to remind anyone new to skincare that it takes weeks to show major results... but if you are having a bad reaction to it, stop using it! Irritation on the skin can spur so many issues, it isn't worth it.\n\ntl;dr-- I think this is just a fancy niacinamide serum and 111Skin tried to set themselves apart from other products by adding words like \"cryo\" and \"ATP\"... and tried to make it niche by adding \"sports\". Aside from marketing BS, it might not be a horrible serum and would be worth trying for anyone that doesn't have a niacinamide product yet (assuming niacinamide, eucalyptus oil, and/or  fragrance doesn't irritate their skin too much).",

Divide between 2 baking sheets and spread in an even layer. Roast, stirring once and rotating the pans top to bottom about halfway through, until tender and beginning to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.\n- Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add flour, salt and pepper; cook, stirring, for 1 minute more. Add cream and continue to stir, scraping up any browned bits. Cook, stirring, until the sauce bubbles and thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. (See Tips.)\n- When the green beans are done, remove from the oven. Preheat the broiler.\n- Transfer half the green beans to a 2-quart, broiler-safe baking dish. Spread half the sauce over the green beans. Add the remaining green beans and top with the remaining sauce.\n- Combine breadcrumbs and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl (skip this step if you are topping with cheese).\n- Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture (or cheese) over the gratin. Place under the broiler and broil, watching closely, until the gratin is bubbling and beginning to brown on top, 1 to 5 minutes, depending on your broiler. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nRoast green beans (Step 2) up to 30 minutes ahead. Prepare the sauce (Step 3), cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day; gently reheat until steaming before combining with the green beans.",

Mix very well and be careful for dough flying out at higher speeds! \n\n\nI use a little more than half the dough for the pizza and the rest for 4 bread sticks. Roll out dough flat between two pieces of parchment paper. I roll it pretty thin and roll up the edge to form a crust. Spread sauce and toppings. Bake on the parchment paper directly on rack until desired golden brown color. Roughly 10-15 minutes. ",

I wanted rich flavour with creamy texture I wanted a real dupe for the real deal. \n\nThe calories come from the protein powder and cocoa powder so you can tweak the calories based on that For example, the same recipe with 1/2 scoop protein powder is actually a great option. I personally prefer the fullness that the full scoop brings.\n\nThe cocoa powder and sugar ratio for basic chocolate ice cream is 1:1 tablespoon ( approx 7.5g cocoa and 12.6g sugar) you can use that to scale the recipe or tweak the flavour concentration. My recipe has a bit more sweetness because of the added instant coffee so it's 1:1.1\n\nHot tip: you can pre-mix the dry ingredients in large batches to create your own instant ice cream mix. Just add water and a dash of vanilla-this is the dream for me!\n\n150 cal rich chocolate ice cream recipe:\n\n1 scoop (~30g depending on product) chocolate protein powder, 3 tbsp(18g) cocoa powder, 1 pinch salt, 1/2 tbsp instant coffee(can use decaf), 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp(1-1.25 gram) xanthan gum, 0 calorie equivalent of 10 tsp of sugar (I use 5 packs of sugar twin, or 3.3 tbsp of a 1:1 erythritol), water (up to the max fill line)\n\nUse the Lite ice cream setting, then re-spin 3 times. If using a mix-in, still re-spin 3 times first since mix-in does not completely replace a re-spin in this case.",

Maybe the pe science one (try a sample pack first to see) after I finish my current tub.\n\n-I used cacao and not cocoa\n-guar gum and not xantham\n-didn’t have instant coffee (but the cacao I think had a stronger taste so I think it evened out)\n-allulose for sweetener \n\nAlso I let it sit for 15 min before I spun it since I was nervous about the water base.. I didn’t even need a respin! Couldn’t believe it.\n\nEdit: final product btw https://imgur.com/a/QR7WCmP",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

I was always scared of dairy, I am a fan of low carb, keto diet. But I recently figured out that gram per gram and calorie per calorie dairy fills me up more than stuff like meat or fish. \n\n3️⃣EGG WHITES-> they are not as filling as dairy but still you can eat a lot of them and they don’t add up to a lot of calories. You can also bake with them and add stuff like psyllium/ oat fibre to them which makes the baking stuff even more satisfying. \n\n4️⃣MEAT-> I love chicken& turkey breast, lean beef steak, lamb& pork lion. They are low calorie and satisfying not as much as dairy or egg whites but still.\n\n5️⃣FISH-> I like tuna steak/ lion, cod and hake. Fish is great. Again not as filling as dairy and egg whites. But still great. \n\n6️⃣SEA FOOD-> My favorite are prawns and shrimps. They are tasty and filling. \n\n7️⃣GELATIN-> Homemade jello (tea jello or coffee jello) great filling snack, high in protein. \n\n8️⃣GUMS-> Konjak gum/ xanthan gum/ guar gum. They are great for making anabolic ice cream and puddings. High in fibre and super filling. \n\n9️⃣FIBRE POWDERS-> Agar agar (for making vegan jelly), Oat fibre/ psyllium (for baking stuff with egg whites), Siberian fibre (it’s similar to wheat bran just much lower in calories, perfect for making a low carb porridge or for baking). \n\n1️⃣0️⃣SHIRITAKI/ KONJAC NOODLES-> they’re made from konjac gum/ powder. High in fibre and super filling. Works great to add volume to the dishes and as a regular noodle replacement.\n\n1️⃣1️⃣YEAST FLAKES/ NOOCH-> yeast flakes are super high in protein& fibre. They tastes just like cheese but they’re vegan friendly. They’re also super nutritious. Can be used  as cheese replacement or as a seasoning for vegetables. \n\n1️⃣2️⃣COFFEE/ CACAO POWDER-> I don’t know if I can classify it as food. But coffee and cacao powder mixed with sweetener (sucralose/ stevia or monk fruit) suppress my appetite.",

    "body": "I first came across a peculiar Japanese food called “Mizu shingen mochi” via some blog I follow sporadically about a year ago. It looked like a giant droplet of water served with a black sugar syrup (kuromitsu) and roasted soybean flour (kinako).\n\nI was curious about it and filed it away at the back of my mind as “something to check out when I get time/go to Japan”; Shingen mochi is a trademark, made by the Kinseiken Seika Company in the Yamanashi Prefecture in Japan. Shingen mochi is a type of rice cake and Mizu shingen mochi is literally a “water cake”.\n\nThe descriptions of it were intriguing, the taste was like slightly sweet spring water — not surprising, since the company say they use Southern Japanese Alps water, somehow gelled into a fragile jelly like sweet that melts in about half an hour at room temperature.\n\nOccasionally, when I get bored, I like to experiment in the kitchen and one day, I saw the Mizu shingen mochi on another blog and decided that I’d have a go at it. How hard could it be after all?\n\nI’d also recently bought a Hakuto jelly from Minamoto Kitchoan in London and was blown away by it. So sweet and tasty. A read of the ingredients revealed that the gelling agents used for that were carageenan, xanthan gum and locust bean gum, all of which I could get my hands on. I went shopping and came back with a packet of agar (a staple of Japanese jelly making), carageenan, xanthan gum, locust bean gum (in a sachet called “vege-gel”) and gelatine. I thought I’d try all of them and see which worked best.\n\nArmed with the above ingredients, I started to make jelly. I followed the recommended amounts of gelling agents at first, and ended up with wobbly, but stiff jellies. The descriptions I’d read said that the Mizu shingen mochi felt like it would fall part if you shook it too much, so these certainly wouldn’t do. Try again…\n\nAttempt 2 was with half the recommended amounts. Gelatine and vege-gel held together, but agar just didn’t solidify at all. Time for another go.\nAttempt 3 was with slightly over half the recommended amounts. All 3 gelled up nicely, not too firm and not too loose. The taste tests were mixed though. Vege-gel tasted slightly dull, gelatine was bland, but agar preserved the ‘crispness’ of the water.\n\nI’d need to be careful though, as it was easy to trap air bubbles in the jelly and they did ruin the look of it somewhat. I also didn’t have any kuromitsu or kinako to hand, so I quickly knocked together a fruit reduction to serve with it.\n\nThe sauce did overpower the delicate water flavour of the jelly, but the entire experience was something quite unique — it literally melted back into water as soon as it hit my mouth. I left half of it on the kitchen counter as a “will it melt in half an hour” test.\n\nAttempt 4 did away with the vege-gel and gelatine and concentrated purely on agar. I used spring water from the local shop (not having a mountain stream nearby, it was the best I could do), added a pinch of home made vanilla sugar, just over half the recommended amount of agar in stages to the water, stirred carefully to hopefully reduce the amount of trapped bubbles and then carefully decanted the mix into a half-sphere mould, which was then placed in an ice bath to gel.\nAfter 20 minutes, a careful prod told me it was about set, so I transferred the mould to the fridge for a little while longer and waited impatiently. After another half hour, I took the mould out of the fridge and carefully decanted the jelly onto a wooden board.\n\nThe vanilla sugar gave it a pleasant sweetness, it melted into water as soon as it hit my tongue and the part I left as as “will it melt in half an hour like the original does” did indeed disappear into a puddle of water in about half an hour. I’d call that a success!\n\nSo, here is my recipe for making a Unicorn Tear (ユニコーンの涙)…\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 240ml Mineral water\n* 2½/3g Agar flakes (depending on water used)\n* a pinch of vanilla sugar\n\nMethod:\n\n* Add the water to a double boiler and sprinkle half the agar flakes on top.\n* Heat until boiling without stirring.\n* Add the rest of the agar gradually to prevent lumpiness.\n* Add the vanilla sugar.\n* Stir occasionally, trying not to introduce too many bubbles for around * 5/10 minutes, until the agar has completely dissolved.\n* Pour into a half sphere mould and cool in an ice bath, then transfer to the fridge to set.\n\nhttps://medium.com/stuff-and-more-stuff/dc25dd9a1c79\n\nhttp://marks.recipes/post/94732016062/unicorn-tear",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

HA It's just a keyword to use because everyone is under the impression that it is awesome but if you know anything about true skin care and how HA really works in the body, you know that it is not good for you. The only time HA is good is if you have a special event or a wedding where you only need to have your skin look plumped and it's best for only a few hours but it's definitely something you do not want to eat everyday!!!

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I’ll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I’ve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn’t a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I’ve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven’t started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn’t really an anti-aging post as I don’t consider myself having “mature” skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I’ll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn’t impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn’t know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I’ve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista’s YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‘cloudy water’ on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven’t come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I’m a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we’re going into summer but I don’t expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I’m using this toner. I’ve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don’t think so. I would notice more if my skin didn’t get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven’t seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I’m not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn’t think I’d have another toner waiting to be purchased, I’d say I’d repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

I did try tret, the 0.5 one but it was really really drying on my skin and darkened my pigmentation unless I exfoliated which made it more dry. Such a pita.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\". These have different names because they're pseudoceramides and/or a part of a patented biomimetic system/delivery method.\n\nSkin Identical Ingredients/ceramides/helpfuls highlighted in **BOLD** except for hyaluronic acid because I can't tell if high molecular weight or low molecular weight HAs were used (some find LMW HA irritating).\n\n*Fragrance = essential oils & artificial fragrance, left in fragrant extracts (less concentrated than essential oils)*\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream**](https://www.ulta.com/intensive-moisture-facial-cream?productId=pimprod2009883) **- 1.4 oz/40 g -

    "body": "Hello friends.  This week, I have had a few cool things happen and ALMOST happen that have me a bit excited.  So, in keeping with my ability to bloviate, here I go with it.     \n     \nWhen I was a WeeTexan (about 45 years ago), I played T-Ball and then YMCA baseball.  After each game, a couple of the parents provided a soda for each player.  Shasta soda was the \"cheap\" soda back then and was typically the brand parents purchased.  So after the game, all of us kids would run over to the cooler because the first kid to the cooler got to choose from all the flavors.  For me, Black Cherry Soda was the first choice with Cream Soda being the second choice.  Anyway, I found Zevia Black Cherry and Cream Soda this week.  It is nice to feel like a kid again.     \n    \nhttps://i.imgur.com/BE8TwNe.jpg     \n      \nAlso when I was a WeeTexan, my mother cooked a roast and it always had what I called \"grease gravy\".  It was simply the juice from the roast with a bit of thickener added to it.  Back then, I hated the \"grease gravy\", but once I moved out, and would go home to eat dinner, I found myself loving the meal.  Anyway, thanks to the ladies of r/xxketo I have learned about Xanthan gum.  So the other day, I slow cooked a pork roast and added some Xanthan gum to make \"grease gravy\".  I used a bit too much Xanthan gum, but it still tasted pretty damn awesome.  I also mashed some cauliflower and it was another reminder of my younger days.    \n      \nhttps://i.imgur.com/G0Opb7S.jpg        \n       \nFinally, as a BigTexan, I have had to shop in stores that only carry bigger clothes  sizes.  Anyway, the other day I was with a friend at a \"regular\" department store and the store carries shirts in size 3X.  Just on a whim, I tried one on, and I am not far away from being able to wear it.  This will be both a wallet victory and NSV victory for me.  The shirt was on sale for $17.  At the big and tall stores, a pair of dress socks cost $17, so I am stoked at the thought of being able to ALMOST shop at a \"regular\" store.     \n    \nAnd last, I woke up this morning and weighed myself.  I am FINALLY back to the weight in my flair.  Finally.  To celebrate, tonight for dinner, I am going to have leftover roast with grease gravy and a Black Cherry Soda.  ",

I have xanthum gum, but I usually add a little cream and cream cheese to broth/drippings to make a milky gravy base.  Last week I finally tried out cheese crisps and cheese drying for homemade moon cheese, and I'm not sure I'll be seeing any scale victories this week, due to my indulgence in that.

    "body": "Anyone on any form of social media knows about Lume Deodorant; their advertising is on point! I loved the catchy commercials, positive reviews, and had been using natural deodorants for years so I thought why the heck not?!? I've been using for 2+ months and felt it was time to write about my experience. I'm a big believer in honesty and transparency and my biggest criticism of this product/company is the inability to leave an unbiased review, even/especially if it's negative; the company never posted my less than stellar review on their website so I'm taking it to this forum. Underarms are skin too!\n\nI purchased the 3oz Lume Unscented Deodorant in the tube for $19USD. I've used it approximately 60x, pea sized amount per pit and I still have some left. It's vegan, cruelty-free, aluminum-free, and baking-soda fee. It's a mandelic acid based product. In the past I've used Schmidt's Original and Sensitive, Native, and an independent Etsy brand. All but Native worked well for odor but eventually they all irritated my pits to different degrees\n\n**PRO** \n\n* The first positive I will say is that it never irritated my pits, even directly after shaving. It's safe to use anywhere the gets stinky but I only have used on my underarms.\n\n**CONS**\n\n* DISHONEST PRACTICES As I mentioned before, I think the company promotes skewed product reviews by omitting critical reviews. This is not cool by me.\n* INEFFECTIVE- Guys, nobody wanted this product to work more than me. I don't have a strong body odor but my underarms will get stinky if I don't use anything. I don't care about getting sweaty (this is not an antiperspirant) but this really didn't work well to control odor. The company is very upfront that to use the product effectively, your clothes need to be treated first to wash off residual bacteria and residue from former products. I bought their recommended detergent and treated all my clothing as directed; nope, still stinky. I repeated the clothing treatments multiples times without results hoping it would work. At that point, I was past the 30 day return window. I bought a few new (washed) shirts and still experienced odor so I think the washing is kind of BS. Some days it would work better than others but it def didn't live up to the 72 hour odor control the company claims. It'll work well for a few hours but after that...phew. My body actually has a different, worse scent when I use this product. \n* \"UNSCENTED\"  is more like...old bananas. It mostly fades but kind of off-putting.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nWater, Mandelic Acid, Arrowroot Powder, Tapioca Starch, Isoamyl Laurate, Sodium Acrylate/ Acryloyldimethyltaurate/ Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Caffeine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Alcohol, Theobroama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Isohexadecane, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Sodium Lactate, Panthenol, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 60, Lecithin, Pullulan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Silica, Fragrance\\*",

    "body": "My girlfriend and I live in an area that does not have a La Colombe. Unfortunately we really like the draft lattes. After some time reverse engineering it, I think we have (nearly) successfully reproduced it. I do not know La colombe’s internal process and I’m working purely from my own information and observations of other drinks and emulsions. All information in this post is original to me and my research and is no way affiliated with La Colombe.\n\nAs a disclaimer we have not done any side by side testing, but it's hard to given the amount of equipment required.\n\nEquipment:\n1. Espresso Machine that is dialed in. La Colombe uses \"cold pressed\" espresso, I guess this is also an option but if you can pull a good shot then id just do that.\n2. A blender. I use an immersion blender--I recommend you do the same.\n3. A milligram-accurate scale.\n4. A 1-1kg scale accurate to 10g is probably fine.\n5. An isi Nitro (N2) siphon. https://isi-store.com/products/isi-nitro. NOTE: this is different than N2O and CO2 siphons. N2 tastes different and operates at a different pressure than the other isi siphons. You will need this or some way to nitrogenate the beverage (I think La Colombe uses a beer setup for this). Either way the most practical device to do this at home is the isi nitro device with their n2 cartridges.\n\nNote: you will likely need two different scales. Most kitchen scales will work for #4 but you’ll probably need a “jewelers” scale for #3.\n\nIngredients (use these ratios for reference, exact measurements will vary based on the taste of your espresso):\n1. 100g Espresso\n2. 500g Chobani oat milk (extra creamy or original does not seem to make any difference).\n3. 600mg (0.1% w/w) Xanthan gum or some other foam stabilizer, refer to [the book Texture](https://khymos.org/recipe-collection/) for other emulsifiers but the stabilizer needs to be soluble in refrigerated oat milk for this recipe and xanthan gum is very easily found. Not all stabilizers can dissolve at a low temperature without adding much flavor. Gellan gum, I forget low- or high-acyl, may be a suitable replacement but will only dissolve at a high temperature. \n4. 1 Isi N2 cartridge.\n\nFor 500-600mL (appx 550g) of oat milk draft latte:\n1. Pull 100g of espresso (this is about 6x 18g shots).\n2. Mix this into 500g of the oat milk. Do this in a container that you can operate your immersion blender in.\n3. Taste this mixture. Add extra espresso or milk to your tasting. The flavor at this point will be the very close to the ending flavor.\n4. Weigh the final mixture.\n5. Use your immersion blender on low to blend the espresso and milk mixture (or transfer to blend on low in a free standing blender).\n6. While blending, slowly (over say 5sec) pour in 0.1% by weight from step #4 of xanthan gum (ie if the mixture is 550g, use 0.55g/550mg). The accuracy of this measurement is critical (even 1gram too much and it’ll be gloppy). Use a milligram scale to measure this. NOTE: Do not blend for more than 20sec after adding the xanthan gum.\n7. Once this is blended immediately transfer it into an isi nitro container and charge with one n2 cartridge. Shake hard up and down 3 times (this extra agitation step is important to make sure the nitrogen gets dissolved into the latte).\n8. Pour slowly and enjoy your textured beverage :).\n\nEdit #1:\nFor clarity, the ratio of espresso to oat milk seems to be around 1:5. This varies greatly on your espresso, so I’d start at 1:4 and figure out which ratio works best (adjust xanthan gum %m/m to reflect the mass of your new ratio).\n\nAlso, the isi nitro is 1L max and I wouldn’t fill it more than 3/4 (the nitrogen doesn’t dissolve as easily when the container is too full). So you cannot produce more than about 700mL of this using the isi nitro method.\n\nEdit #2:\nSome people have offered recommendations which I will try to summarize them:\n\n1. Chobani barista oat milk has emulsifiers mixed in meaning that you may not need to weigh and mix an extra emulsifier in if used instead of the chobani original/extra creamy. This is true of the other chobani oat milks too (they have Gellan gum) but perhaps the concentration is higher in the Barista milk?\n2. “On-tap” Cold brew may be used instead of cold pressed espresso.\n3. The addition of more emulsifiers may not be necessary when using the barista oat milk and using a nitro beer keg. In my testing with the isi nitro+(original OR extra creamy) chobani it has been necessary, but may differ with a nitro keg+chobani barista oat milk.\n\nNOTE: Additional emulsifiers could also help stabilize the beverage making it stay “textured” longer (this hasn’t been tested).\n\nEdit #3:\nI tried chobani barista with stok cold brew and here are my results.\n1. Using cold brew does accurately reproduce the flavor (although using a different coffee:milk ratio) rather than espresso is probably a better approach here — it’s more controllable and easier than pulling back to back espresso shots.\n2. We were still unable to replicate the texture without using an emulsifier. This solidifies my opinion that La Colombe definitely adds another emulsifier (in addition to the one included in the milk) to help stabilize their foam after pouring. Another user below indicated that La Colombe may be doing this with their on tap cold brew packets which are used in their in-store recipe.\n\nThe following is an exact recipe for making a draft latte using cold brew in the isi nitro. Assuming that chobani and Stok are fairly consistent, this should be pretty easily reproducible.\n\n1. Mix 500g of chobani barista oat mil into 420g of Stok cold brew.\n2. Use an immersion blender to slowly dust in 0.1% m/m (or 0.920g) of xanthan gum.\n3. Blend this to incorporate air over 35sec.\n4. Quickly transfer to an isi nitro vessel. Charge with one N2 gas cartridge.\n5. Shake vigorously 20 times.",

        "body": "Stumbled across this thread while googling to find the recipe. Found an old zendesk question where La Colombe confirmed they add emulsifiers to the draft latte mix:\n\nThe on-tap Draft Latte at our cafes and the Lattes in the can are a little different. In the cafes, our kegs are made fresh every day by our baristas with nothing but whole milk (or oat milk for our dairy-free Draft Latte), our cold-pressed espresso, (Acacia/Xanthan) gums, and nitrous oxide. This is a very perishable version of the beverage, so at the end of the day, we dispose of any extra product and start fresh the next morning. We even clean and flush the line on the tap daily to keep things sanitary and tasting great!\n\nThe canned version of the latte is formulated differently to be a shelf-stable product and ready to be enjoyed on the go. When you buy a draft latte in the cafe, you have the option of adding sweeteners from the bar.  Since a majority of consumers do add some sugar, but may not be able to do so while on the go, the canned version is formulated with this already added in. It is made with reduced-fat milk instead of whole milk. The small amount of added sugar plays a role beyond sweetening the drink. It also helps balance the macronutrient profile, which has a major impact on how the beverage holds its texture and also affects the shelf life. Various sugar substitutes would only act as a sweetener and would not complete all of the jobs this small amount of sugar is doing for us. With that being said, we have reformulated the canned Latte in the past by finding ways to reduce calories without sacrificing taste, and our R&D team will be working to come up with even healthier versions in the future!

Loads of tests this week, lots of admin to prepare for the market in three weeks (omg), and I finally got the croissant recipe pinned down (located at the bottom of this description!!). It’s been a lot but so worth it!\n\nBakes this week include the Nutella Supreme, more cardamom buns, croissants made with my new dough sheeter from Kneader Japan (I love it!), test run on chausson au pomme (apple turnovers), and testing dipping the pistachio supreme in even more pistachio butter 😍 plus solidifying my sourdough recipe 🙌🏻 ooo boy it’s been a week. \n\nAnyway for the most important part: \n\n\nGluten-Free Croissants\n\nYields approx. 4-6 Croissants\n\nIngredients\n\nMix 1 (Dry + Butter)\n\t•\t100g Superfine white rice flour\n\t•\t90g Tapioca flour\n\t•\t60g Millet flour\n\t•\t20g Corn starch\n\t•\t50g Dry milk powder\n\t•\t50g Sugar\n\t•\t20g Pea protein\n\t•\t6g Psyllium husk\n\t•\t¼ tsp Konjac gum\n\t•\t½ tsp Xanthan gum\n\t•\t1 tsp Kosher salt\n\t•\t1 tsp Baking powder\n\t•\t50g Softened unsalted butter\n\nMix 2 (Wet)\n\t•\t160g Whole milk \n\t•\t30g Active sourdough starter (fed within 6–8 hours, I use brown rice flour)\n\t•\t2 Eggs (room temperature)\n\t•\t15g Fresh yeast (or 7.5g active dry yeast)\n\nButter Block\n\t•\t160g Unsalted butter, 82% butterfat (e.g., Isigny Ste-Mère or Kerrygold)\n\n⸻\n\nDAY 1 – MAKE DÉTREMPE (BASE DOUGH)\n\t1.\tMix dry ingredients:\n\t•\tIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine Mix 1.\n\t2.\tMix wet ingredients:\n\t•\tBlend Mix 2 using a blender or immersion blender until smooth and homogeneous.\n\t•\tEnsure no clumps of starter or yolk remain.\n\t3.\tCombine & knead:\n\t•\tWith the mixer running on low, slowly pour Mix 2 into Mix 1.\n\t•\tLet knead for 3-4 minutes, until a smooth dough forms.\n\t•\tDough should be soft and may be somewhat sticky.

The rest of the arm is perfectly clean of cosmetics (but full of white dust! 😂). I didn't have any AB sunscreen at the moment but I was thinking of trying foundation with SPF and maybe a before/after in the evening... How much sunscreen stays on my body after X hours?\n\nThe lamp I used, I bought many years ago. I am not able to tell which wavelenght it produces (/u/katherine-the-wild can you help?).  \n\nPhone: iPhone SE\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n>Avéne Lait enfant 50+ INCI: *Avene thermal spring water (avene aqua), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, dicaprylyl carbonate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, water (aqua), glycerin, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol, methoxyphenl triazine, diethylhexyl butamido, triazone, diisopropyl adipate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, cetearyl isononanoate, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2, dipolyhydroxystearate, decyl glucoside, benzoic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, disodium EDTA, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl dibehenate, hydrogenated palm glycerides, hydrogenated palm kernel glycerides, polyacrylate-13, polyisobutene, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, sorbitan, isostearate, tocopherol, tocopheryl glucoside tribehenin, xanthan gum.* \n\n>Avéne Sunsimed INCI: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Nano), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzoic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Excipients* (being a medical device I wasn't able to find a complete list of ingredients).  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry but I wasn't comfortable sharing pictures of my face. But the sunscreen showed up reeeally well and I could see all of the spots I missed. I also could see all the sun damage and hyperpigmentation that isn't visible under regular lights. 😭   \nIf anyone else has a blacklight available and could test it with other sunscreens, I would be very curious to see the results! Thanks everyone!",

It might have to do with applying a higher concentration to the swatch than you normally would to your face, and because it’s easier to get even coverage on a small, flat surface than in all little contours of your face. I also found that it only really works with physical sunscreens. The black light is looking for the white pigment in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to bounce off of, so it works best with physical sunscreens, not as well with combo sunscreens, and almost not at all with chemical sunscreens.",

My ears asked for all day, with liquid that flowed, it woke me at night, bits of skin all dry and white stuck every day, scratched and fell... A nightmare. And the WORST symptom was a huge production of ear wax that forced me to have my ears uncorked every month, I lost hearing very often (the equivalent of 2 beans of wax produced in only 2 days!)\n- I started to hear about lactose intolerance, I stop all dairy products: no results\nI started thinking about gluten intolerance (big topic) and the first results were there! Finally a remarkable decrease in symptoms (there are a multitude of other symptoms including neurological that I also had) but the eczema were still there although better at 50%, then after a few months the production of ear wax worsened as well as the itching of the auditory canal, I produce as much wax in 1 day as in 2 years!\nI find out about Reddit, internet, forums blogs and finally THE reason for eczema! A complete intolerance to corn!\nCorn is present in 95 of the industrial food derivatives (dextrose, glucose syrup, guar gum, xanthan gum, in soda PARTOUT). I start to do the drastic and very meticulous hunting for any trace of corn and in less than 3 weeks all my exzema disappeared, FINALLY!\nNo more itching, no more ear wax at all, mental clarity, no more problems with concentration, memory, anxiety, suicidal thoughts (yes it is one of the neurological symptoms of gluten and corn intolerance) and eating differently by avoiding corn is ultimately easy, unless you live in the USA where corn is even more present everywhere.\n\n",

It's great you found changing your diet works! I wonder if you inadvertently changed things you didn't realize as well. For instance , you cut out gluten, so bread, which means you don't make sandwiches which means you may not be eating as much meat, since you may have put certain meats in your sandwiches? Just speculation though. I'm glad you shared your story and got the results you wanted!",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.

    "body": "So I have been playing with the chemistry of ice cream to create something that is\n\n1) idiot proof\n\n2) delicious\n\n3) quick\n\nAnd I think I've done it.\n\nYou will need:\n\n* 1.5 cups (340ml) water \n* 1 cup (125g) crushed ice\n* 1/2 cup (60g) allulose\n* 4 scoops (100g) unflavored whey isolate (I use impact whey isolate from myprotein).  You could probably use flavored too instead of adding flavor later\n* 1/2tsp xanthan gum\n* 1/2tsp guar gum\n* liquid sucralose or stevia drops to taste (optional)\n\nin a high powered blender combine 1.5 cups cold water, 4 scoops unflavored whey protein (100 grams), and 1/2 cup (60g) allulose.  While it is running, add 1/2tsp guar gum and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum, and 1 cup crushed ice, and about 10 drops of liquid sucralose.  Monitor the speed of the blender so that it keeps a vortex and add whatever flavorings you like. 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, some instant coffee, peppermint, MIO water flavorings, vanilla, whatever.  Once ice is totally obliterated take the temperature of the mixture with a thermometer and it should be somewhere around 35-40 degrees.  Pour directly into your 1qt ice cream maker and churn until set (about 10 minutes, until it reaches 22 degrees F), then freeze.\n\nThis will make about a quart of dessert due to air content.  The guar gum keeps ice crystals from forming, the allulose keeps it soft and adds sweetness, the xanthan gum allows air to be whipped into it and stabilizes it.  You get a quart of luscious and satisfying \"ice cream\" that, in my version, is only about 350 calories and a whopping 80 grams of protein.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nhere's a batch from last night flavored with banana extract.  Behold the texture.  https://imgur.com/gallery/6lwLX6P",

    "body": "🙇🏻‍♀️ **Skin background:**\n\n\nDry, sensitive skin. Acne, fungal acne and eczema prone. Easily congested.\nI have PIE and redness, but I don't have much dark spots or discoloration (aside from what's left behind after eczema flared ups) \n\nAlso I live in a dry, hot climate where the sun is really harsh.\n\n\n📈 **About the charts (slide 2 and 3)**:\n\n\n0 means least of the \"title\" and 5 means most of the \"title\"; like \"thickness\" is rated 1 means it's not a thick toner, and is really watery.\n\n\n🧴 **Coming to the product:**\n\n\n- Name: Skin1004 madagascar centella tone brightening boosting toner.\n\n- Period of usage: 1 month\n\n\n- I use it in the morning in this routine:\nCleanse (Benzoyl peroxide cleanser) > Toner 1 (isntree green tea fresh toner) > Toner 2 (this skin1004 toner) > Moisturise > Sunscreen\n\n\n> Ingredients: Centella Asiatica Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Betaine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Water, Glucose, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n- Fungal acne safe: YES ✅\n\n\n💭 **My thoughts:**\n\n\nWhen I first saw the product the ingredients list looked promising, but i couldn't find much on reddit about it. I use skinsort a lot though (it's an app where you can check whether a product is fungal acne safe or not) and I looked up this product there and the reviews were really good so I ended up ordering it!\n\n\nThis did not disappoint! I think you can get a fair idea of how I feel about the products through the charts that I have attached, but it's really good and it suits my skin well. It's hydrating, soothing, quick absorbing and it works. Also, it mildly exfoliates the skin but it's not too much and in my opinion it's safe for everyday use! \n\n\nI have used skin1004's tone brightening ampoule too, and I like it but I like this toner WAY more than that ampoule, and in my opinion it works better than the ampoule. Plus if you look up the ampoule on reddit many people have said it broke them out, and I suspect the ampoule was breaking me out too, but I didn't have any such issue with this toner.\n\n\nOverall, I would rate it 4.5/5, will keep repurchasing it. Also, i can tell this will last a while because I have been using it almost everyday, and I layer it twice, but I've only used up the amount you see in the picture so 👀\n",

I’m going to try it with coconut flour later to see how that works too, but I have a feeling it may be too dense 🤷🏻‍♀️. But anyways, the texture is chewy because of the tapioca flour (which i quite enjoy) and it doesn’t have a whole lot of flavour on its own which is good if you want to be versatile for toppings. You can also add in whatever seasonings you like to mix it up! The recipe is included below 😋!  \n\n**Recipe**  \n- 25g oat fiber\n- 10g tapioca flour\n- 0.5 tsp baking powder\n- 0.25 tsp xanthan gum\n- 1 pinch salt \n- 30g aquafaba (or 30g egg white)\n- 15g sf maple syrup\n- Water (add slowly in increments, thick pancake batter consistency)  \n\n1. Mix dry ingredients \n2. Add in aquafaba and syrup, mix\n3. Start adding in water slowly \n4. Clean up sides of container and let it sit for a few minutes \n5. Microwave for 3 minutes\n6.

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "Hi AB! :) I lurk here *every single night* and also occasionally post here. I recently wrote this... enormous monstrosity on rosacea and shared it over at /r/skincareaddiction, but also wanted to share it here since I have found lots of value in the discussions here as well as the science surrounding AB ingredients (such as snail mucin, propolis, etc.). \n\nIn the future, I plan to do a large post that combines both AB product recommendations and SCA recommendations (as well as mine) for rosacea, but I felt this would be it's own post that I would later connect to this one.\n\nThanks so much for being awesome. I love this sub to bits and frequently come here when I am feeling down or anxious. I hope this helps some of you. <3",

The first attempt was pretty good and the taste was there! The egg and cream cheese gave it an amazing cheese-cake-meets-ice-cream sensation/taste. But it didn't have enough bulk for my liking so I added in frozen cauliflower florets, which surprisingly not only increased the size and density but enhanced the creaminess like crazy!\n\nAlong with the crushed up Graham crackers on top, I realised i suddenly had a protein cheesecake ice cream base recipe. Which meant I could start getting weird with it.  \n\n\nBlueberry cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake, pumpkin cheesecake, the possibilities are endless!  I havent tried it yet but I would presume using a chocolate or PB flavored protein would be amazing too. My favorite so far's gotta be raspberry cheesecake (first 2 pics), drizzled with chocolate syrup. It tastes like Greg Doucette moonwalking on your tonsils.  \n\n\nI've become weirdly obsessed with this base lol, I've made it countless times and every single one has come out amazing. Wanted to share and hear other people's thoughts, especially if you try out any variations!  \n\n\n**Protein cheesecake ice cream base recipe:**\n\n* 160g unsweetened almond milk (any milk works)\n* 70g fat free Greek yogurt (can also use fat free cottage cheese or quark)\n* 70 fat free (or low fat) cream cheese\n* 7g sugar free Cheesecake Jell-O mix (can also use vanilla or white chocolate flavor)\n* 1 full medium egg\n* 28g Walden Farms Pancake Syrup (any syrup works - enhances texture and acts as a gelling agent)\n* 4g vanilla extract\n* 4g cake extract (butter extract works too!)\n* 3g salt\n* 18g erythrytol (less or more depending on how sweet you want it)\n* 2g xanthan gum + 2g guar gum (the combination of these 2 works best but you can use 4g of either if you only have one)\n* 40g PEScience Cake Pop (Vanilla works too! And it doesnt have to be PEScience, any whey/casein blend will work)\n* 120g frozen cauliflower\n* 100g frozen berries OR 100g more frozen cauliflower\n* 320g ice\n\n**Toppings**\n\n* 16g crushed up Graham crackers\n* *Optional*: sprinkles, fat free whipped cream, sprinkles, syrup, whatever you want!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions**\n\n* Add ingredients to a powerful blender (preferably a Ninja!)\n* Blend for 1 minute on high, then use a rubber spatula to scrape down the side and make sure you scrape out any powder that gets stuck to the sides or in the edges\n* Blend for another 2 minutes on high\n* Add toppings and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Macros & Calories** (for 9 cups worth of the raspberry version pictured)\n\n* Macros: 41 Carbs | 11 Fat | 54 Protein\n* Calories: 486",

Nasaktuhan na nakita kong naka-live yung sa Dermorepubliq kaya napagpasyahan kong tingnan ang kanilang mga product. May isang product na nakatawag pansin sa akin: ang kanilang 1% Retinol Serum. \n\nNapukaw ng product na ito ang aking pansin dahil sa taas ng retinol na nilalaman nito. Mataas ang 1% retinol para sa isang leave-on product, ang rekomendasyon nga lang nito sa E.U. ay nasa 0.3% lang (https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/revision-scientific-opinion-sccs157616-vitamin-retinol-retinyl-acetate-retinyl-palmitate_en). \n\nKaya sinilip o naman sa listing ng Dermorepubliq 1% Retinol Serum, una kong hinanap ang ingredient list nito. Pero laking gulat ko nung makita ko ang ingredient list nito:\n\nAqua, Isopropyl Myristate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Niacinamide, Retinyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Allantoin\n\nWalang Retinol, imbes, Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalagay. Malinaw na mislabeled ang produktong ito. Hindi ko tuloy maintindihan kung papaano nakalusot sa FDA ito noong nag-apply ito ng cosmetic product notification. 🤦‍♂️\n\nKaya para sa lahat: laging maging mapanuri sa inyong binibiling produkto.

    "body": "I think it's safe to post this; I've been SIBO clear for about a year and a half. \n\n## Pre text (can be skipped)\n\nBefore that I had complications that spanned around 10 years; I've been a poster here for just under that. In that time I've been exceptionally confused; seen 4 'top gastroenterologists' and 2 renown dieticians as well as countless other doctors. I've tried all main orthodox treatments of SIBO including; rifaximin, herbals, elemental diets, carnivore, fasting and probiotics. I've been considered to have had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Major depressive disorder among other things. I've 100% considered taking my life many many times, some out of despair and knee-jerk, many others while sober calculative and rational. \n\nIn short; I've been through what I believe to be (having been here for a while) the absolute worst SIBO can throw at someone. I've had the 'full' SIBO experience. And now I'm on the other side. My ENTIRE life has been absolutely governed by these health issues and it has taken my best years. Anyway enough dramatics - I just wanted to paint the picture of the severity of my issues with it so that I may offer those who'm have had the worst of SIBO some hope.\n\nJust to be clear; I have no concrete answers (and would challenge anyone who claims to) but I have an anecdotal 'pseudo-informed' explanation of my fall into SIBO and eventually climb out of it. I've taken special effort to highlight genuine significant tips that are likely to help others.\n\n## Context\n\nDuring many breath tests that spanned 6+ years I had mostly hydrogen positive results but also had 1 methane positive result. \n\n## How I got SIBO\n\nThis is disputed and no medical professional has given me an explanation. However I have a high confidence that I got SIBO during taking prolonged antibiotics whilst backpacking. I was prescribed Doxycycline as an anti-malaria pill to take before during or after my trips. I did 3 stints of 1 month trips in the space of 3 years and that's when my symptoms started. Additionally; it's very possible that I had food poisoning on one of the trips. So; main likely-hood is that I got SIBO from either *food poisoning* or extended *exposure to antibiotics*. I would now categorise it as 'irresponsible exposure to antibiotics' from negligent medical professionals who wiped out my gut flora.\n\n## Symptoms diagnosis and tests\n\nSkipping the storytelling rhetoric; the main facts are that I saw about 5 doctors who'm all I would describe as hugely uninformed on intestinal issues; all of them concentrated on my symptom relief and none of them had any concept of exploring a functional explanation. Two exceptions to this were Chrons and Coeliac disease. These were two worthwhile tests that were 'negative' on both a stool and stomach biopsy.\n\nAdditionally I had either myself or from a healthcare professional entertained about 5 or 6 other different diagnosis before SIBO was considered. That's obviously a huge time waste. \n\nMostly though; I found out about the fairytale concept of 'IBS'. Remember I'm just some idiot on the internet but controversially I don't think IBS exists and I think the term is used by doctors who have no idea what the issue is that they're being presented with. If a doctor ever used the term 'ibs' with me I would significantly reconsider the value I put on their expertise. \n\nMy second gastroenterologists eventually considered SIBO and I blew positive on a hydrogen breath test after consuming lactulose.\n\nOther tests I underwent were ultrasonics; MRI to check upper bowls, flexi sigmoidoscopy (large bowl colonoscopy), masses of stool and blood too. None of them have anything to note really. \n\n## Symptoms\n\nI will list my symptoms so that those of you with them can decide how much use my anecdotes on my journey to remission is. \n\n# Experienced mostly but not limited to roughly 1 hour after meals\n\n* Significant brain fog\n\n* Significant lethargy \n\n* Muscle weakness and strain predominantly in neck and shoulders\n\n* Bloating\n\n* Sudden onset of powerful depression/anxiety \n\n* Sugar cravings/desire to eat more/sense of not being full\n\n* Hot/uncomfortable \n\n# Experienced in general such as outside of meals\n\n* Constipation/diarrhea  \n\n* Continued fatigue/lethargy and muscle pain/strain/stiffness \n\n* Continued anxiety and depression\n\n* General discomfort usually accompanied by sense of being too hot \n\n* Spells of night-sweating \n\n# Experienced at some point but not long standing over the years\n\n* Overwhelming spells of panic attacks or adrenal crashes\n\n* Constant muscle stiffness \n\n* Spells of muscle pain or lymphatic pain in shoulder/neck region that lasted days\n\n* Noticeable sense of dread or mortality and general dissociation \n\n**Let it be duly noted I consider the majority of these symptoms to be associated with food sensitivities** or other 'knock on' illness from SIBO in the body and not necessarily direct SIBO symptoms. \n\nAlso of significant note; I very rarely ever had any pain in my stomach. There was a time I considered if my shoulder/neck pain was 'referred pain' but that's extremely speculative. \n\n## Related illnesses\n\nI consider SIBO to be the tree trunk in a wider map for those who'm have become chronically ill from it. To continue the analogy there's many branches of second-hand illnesses caused by the SIBO and those branches have their own symptoms but also have their own branches of related illness. \n\nI strongly believe this is why so many of us have such specific individual symptoms and cures. I would like you to consider; if you listed all your symptoms; that many of them are symptoms from secondary or tertiary illness and not all from SIBO. \n\nAt this point another significant note is **I continued to feel extremely bad symptoms whilst being clear from SIBO**. That is to say; I would be negative for SIBO on a breath test and then hours/minutes/days later I would feel symptoms and even be more symptomatic. \n\nAnother significant note is that **secondary/tertiary illnesses from SIBO likely contributed to getting reoccurring SIBO again**. To be clear; I believe it can be as it was with me that some of the related illnesses can make you get a bacterial overgrowth again.\n\nThis explains my and many others 'chicken and egg' cycle of reoccurring SIBO. It can also explain why no single cure works for everyone. \n\nHere is the list of related illnesses I had at one time or other from SIBO. \n\n* Intestinal permeability \n\n* Chronically slow motility\n\n* Multiple food intolerance \n\n* (I didn't get it, but SIFO is a popular one) \n\n* Gluten sensitivity \n\n* CHS (chronic fatigue syndrome) \n\n* Gut Dysbiosis  \n\n* Vagus nerve dysfunction \n\n* Adrenal fatigue \n\n* Autistic behaviour and ADHD spells \n\n* Nutritional deficiencies \n\n\n## Functional timeline; Tree of Weeds\n\nThis section is my best guess at what functional illnesses I had which best described by symptoms during the long journey of illness. With explanations to how they relate and in the next section - how I identified/managed and attempted to cure them. \n\n1. I believe I got SIBO from either antibiotic abuse or food poisoning. Side-note: *I earnestly believe that normal people sometimes get a SIBO issue but find it goes away naturally and they never knew any better. More technology and information with products like food-marble and other shit will probably dis/prove my hypothesis. But I also earnestly believe if I had known about SIBO and treated it with rifaximin with responsible diet and re-introduction of gut flora I could have lived a drastically different life and that would have been the end of it.*\n\n2. With a SIBOvergrowth I believe due to a compounding bad diet of high fodmaps and sugar it blew into a bad case. \n\n3. I believe that at this stage I started to damage the integrity of my intestinal wall.\n\n4. With a damaged intestinal wall I believe food and/or toxins fed through into my body and an allergenic or immune response took place. This is referred to as Leaky Gut or Intestinal Permeability. This is where I believe I got multiple food intolerances.\n\n5. With further exposure to both fodmaps and sensitive foods I believe I started to onload a) *gut dysbiosis* b) *inflammation* c) *chronic stress* into my body\n\n**5a. Gut dysbiosis** This is a very controversial area to say anything with any surety about. In short; the stools harbour uncountable strains of various bacterias with nuanced balances and measurements. There's a fallacy that we eat stuff, digest it and absorb it. In reality we digest food into smaller bits we may absorb some of that but a great deal of it isn't and is absorbed by the bacteria and the bacteria in part feed or benefit us. \nThat is to say *when we eat; we feed the bacteria in our gut and our bacteria then feeds us*. \nGut dysbiosis I believe is a wide open gateway to general chronic health issues. The reason I believe that is the jobs these bacteria are doing are so essential to modern day humans and modern diets that without them we can be reduced to slithers of normality with links to autism, attention disorders, mental health and performance as well as general regulation of nutritional nourishment that plays vital roles in providing VITAL bodily mechanisms such as enzymes with the co-enzyme ingredients to undertake fundamental bodily processes. \n\nIn simple terms; with gut dysbiosis one can quickly evolve nutritional deficiencies which no longer provide key bodily processes the ability to do their jobs. One example is; magnesium, zinc and b vitamins are known to be heavily reliant on intestinal health in order to absorb into the body. Without those key nutrients mental performance can nose dive, mental health too and basic detoxification that your body relies on for things like air-polution and food exposure to toxins. Additionally Gut dysbiosis can lead to low/absent levels of KEY bacteria that is solely relied on to break down food matter. For example; most vegetables have novel defence mechanisms to stop predators eating/digesting them. One such mechanism is **'Oxalates'** which are razor sharp crystals that harm insects mouths and tear soft matter apart. Our intestines have bacteria which stops this happening but in my case I had dangerously low levels of it and had oxalate build up issues. Gut dysbiosis is so harmful that one could do a series of posts on it so I'll stop here. IT'S BAD. \n\n**5b. Inflammation** due to exposure to all kinds of toxins or food matter that you wouldn't usually be and in the amounts you usually wouldn't be; as well as general dysbiosis and the inability to safely absorb food matter that's anti-inflammatory.. You can find yourself with chronic inflammation. \nThis is incredibly nuanced and specific to the individual. But one thing medical professionals do agree on is that chronic inflammation can be and is the cause for many chronic illnesses. If you have prolonged inflammation you are opening the door for the majority of illness or disease. In my case I found that it would cause me joint pain and ache and/or nerve pain. A clinical psychologist also evaluated me over 6 months and was genuinely considering inflammation in my brain as the main mechanism for my sudden major depressive disorder symptoms.\n\n**5c. Chronic Stress** sorry but I need to give a personal anecdote here. Before I was ill I was a young professional who'm ran marathons, went backpacking, climbed my profession quickly and read quantum physics books, had 15+ hobbies in sports, art and academia. I meditated regularly, created websites threw myself into any challenge and usually always exceeded in it. I was no special person or gifted individual specifically but I had an energy and drive to go after all my various interests and disciplines with an energy that saw me generally thrive as a person. A part from a healthy dose of of emotions and self therapy I did all of this with minimal overhead and even coasted in many areas. The reason I boast all this is that 'stress' wasn't a problem. Yeah I felt stress but I was also so good at self therapy intuitively and had such good emotional intelligence that I had healthy and effective coping mechanisms for stress. Life was a cake walk. \nI now know that Chronic Stress isn't just subjectively 'how we feel' but it's also a functional aspect of the body too. This is all relevant to SIBO because when your body is doing stuff like detox, immune responses to food sensitivities, digesting, healing or dealing with dysbiosis etc. All of these things put functional stress on the body. During this you may feel fine but your body is in overload mode. \nOne of the things that the body does related to stress is the nervous system. Without going into detail I'd basterdise anyway; our body induces stress and reduces stress, on purpose using functional mechanisms such as the adrenal gland and thyroid among others. For these systems to work; nutrition is required, for example adaptogens are useful for the adrenal gland as well as b vitamins and probably other core vitamin/minerals and iodine and other stuff is used by the thyroid. Obviously; without proper access to those ingredients as can be the case with SIBO or dysbiosis, those systems aren't in good shape. Additionally; whilst having those systems in place; it's still possible to overwhelm them and that can be the case especially with the adrenal gland. \n\nNow I'm writing so much text here so I'm going to skip over the thyroid but it's one of the most known and checked organs by doctors when you present with fatigue or energy issues so I don't feel I need to deep dive further than your own google search. But Adrenal Fatigue is a much more controversial concept and with a much more tenuous link to SIBO that I will focus on that. SIBO and dysbiosis and intestinal permeability (leaky gut) ALL out the body under significant stress. Personally I had periods where I had genuine car-crash powerful adrenal crashes and attacks. You can google those terms but the chances are if you've ever felt wounded and beaten and exasperated and mortally concerned with a state of experience you're in, you've had adrenal issues. Adrenal issues can be managed with adaptogens and making sure you manage nutritional deficiencies. I only want to advertise the concept here because I genuinely believe it could make someone with SIBO feel isolated and tempted to kill themselves. Please look into it if this rings any truth with you and get help.\n\n5c. .. Chronic Stress **Continued** there's two major nervous systems that are important for motility and stress. *The sympathetic system* controls “fight-or-flight” responses. This turns us into a 'full power mode' that provides short term higher ability but at a cost. The parasympathetic system regulates “rest and digest” functions, again at a trade-off that we're more relaxed and sedative. The hot take here is that **prolonged adrenal issues compounds motility issues**. Sibo causes bodily stress, bodily stress slows motility, gut issues get worse, more stress is added. Sound familiar? \n\n6. Going back to my tree analogy you can see now that from chronic stress, intestinal permeability (leaky gut), inflammation, and gut dysbiosis ... I now had various thick branches on the tree that themselves had their own symptoms and smaller branches. All in the tree of dis-ease. Some of these branches became cyclic and the point I want to make here is that I believe even if I was treating SIBO whether it be rifaximin, prolongued low fodmap diet, herbals or whatever. I would easily create another overgrowth and the entire time my feedback loop of 'treating sibo, ok now I should *feel better*, but I don't' was out of whack. This confused me and also my doctors. How can I blow a clear breath test and still feel very very unwell? It was because of the other branches. \n\n7. Detoxing and Sibo. Sibo just creates a lot of load on detox pathways in the body. Even a normal person eating a normal diet will be using their detox pathways to remove bits of bacteria or toxins from normal food drink and air. When you have SIBO, your food, overgrowth and diet will be creating toxins. Those toxins will more easily enter your system through compromised gut walls and cause an overload to your detox pathways. In addition, in the case of dysbiosis, different strains of bacteria are dying and releasing further toxins. And lastly as the overgrowth dies (normal bodily functions such as bile, motility etc kill SIBO cells as well as any antibiotics or herbals) those bacterias when dying will release up to 72 different toxins. \n\n[There's two major detox pathways Phase I and Phase II](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/59497143b8a79b44531a340f/1498691478811-SFU0IY1CUA117VAKHUXI/image-asset.jpeg). These are bodily functions that, like other functions can be overloaded but also require nutritional ingredients to fuel their enzymic actions. So, b12/folate which is normally low in SIBO people as well as sulphur which is low (provided you don't have hydrogen-sulphur SIBO or not). Additionally, a lot of people have natural genetic inefficiencies that affect their phase I/II detoxification which otherwise wouldn't be such a huge problem - but having SIBO can exasperate. I already feel like I'm dishing out an irresponsible amount of pseudo-science so won't go into detail but things to check are MTHFR, sulphur-pathways and 'active-b12'. Detoxing and SIBO go hand in hand and it's essential that you have a healthy detox pathway. \n\n8. Nutritional deficiencies can and will pop up with low fodmap diets and gut dysbiosis in general. At this point it's possible that you're lacking pivotal nutritional vitamins or minerals. As sporadically referenced these can cause further issues. In general the things to watch for are Zinc, Magnesium, active b vitamins, D3, K2, E, molybdenum. \n\n## Functional Timeline; Cutting the tree\n\nIf you're one of the individuals who's got themselves a toxic tree formed, there is a way out. The overwhelmingly annoying thing is; it will take time and energy and it will require you to formally commit to tackling it. When it comes to complex reoccurring SIBO for over 5+ years you can't half-ass the way out. The good thing is, if you're in a dire situation as I was, you wont be lacking for motivation. Energy and time (and cost) though can be hard to come by. Taking one step at a time can help you and doing a little bit for each tree can too. I will try now to provide you with tools, tricks and outright solutions that I employed to functionally get myself in a better place and I 100% have done that to a significant measure. So there's hope.\n\n# Diet is ABSOLUTELY key. \n\nThe main problem with diets I fell into, it I would try one at a time and not feel any real benefit. It was only after I was informed of most of them and painstakingly tried various things did I find out that in the end I could take facets from different diets and in addition, use them at the right time. \n\nThe obvious strategy on going 'low fodmap' is the least controversial diet tool. But, despite that is still very controversial. Long term low fodmap diets are bad for you and can result in gut imbalances. Additionally, Mayo Clinic, one of the top formal bodies in SIBO advise not to make diet changes because it can *\"result in a situation where a patient has avoided most foods and will have trouble adding them back in\"* I personally disagree. I believe short term dietary changes can be used to great affect and in some cases the alternative isn't possible. Who you going to believe, a world renowned health body or an internet stranger?\n\nEither way having a low fodmap diet will result in symptom relief yes. But relying on it; or lazily using it while you \"hope SIBO will clear\" isn't going to be useful for you long term. I strongly suggest you treat FODMAPs like a wave in the sea. Stand on the beach with no FODMAP exposure to get a 'baseline understanding' of your symptoms and if there's any relief. It's also a good tool to prevent rampant overgrowths. *Then* while curing SIBO whether it's Rifaximin/Neomycin or herbals.. try to incorporate FODMAPs by wading into the water a little bit and seeing how it feels and then wading in farther in/out depending on the type of FODMAP and all the while paying acute attention to your symptoms. \n\nHowever **low fodmap is NOT the only dietary tool, not by a long shot**. As well as fodmaps directly fuelling fermentation there's some key natural food chemicals that make up our food. Understanding these groups is **fundamental to anyone with food sensitivity issues or chronic illness**. This single paragraph I think it's the powerful paragraph that SIBO practitioners and patients need to read. There are 3 main food chemicals that your body can form sensitivities to through large exposure of which is typical with intestinal permeability. **Salicylates, Amines and Glutamates**. If you have chronic symptoms of SIBO or have had it for a long time, or have reoccurring SIBO or are symptomatic after SIBO or find low fodmap diets don't help... You are likely sensitive to one or more of these groups. If you're in the worst step and are sensitive to them all; which I think is unlikely, a carnivore diet for a few days to find a baseline and then introducing one at a time is useful. But if you're in that situation I honestly think you need help from a knowledgeable dietician. [Google each one](https://alessandraedwards.com/foods-high-in-salicylates-amines-and-glutamates/), find the foods that each one has and you will likely find that you'll notice the one the you have most problems with. The best way is to research one at a time and find the food list associated with each. Just going through salicylates made me realise that was the chemical I had a problem with. It's likely that just removing that one food chemical from your diet can as of tomorrow significantly improve your life. Food sensitivities I believe are rampant explanations for many syndromes, chronic illnesses or other unknown issues that no one has thought to link. Following a 'specific carbohydrate diet' with special attention to the 3 food chemicals and using 'carnivore' or some other baseline diet is the best advice I can give here. As well as that, Elemental diets can permit these food groups so if you've done an elemental diet and still felt symptomatic that could be why. \n\nMany 'healthy foods' or SIBO tools are high in food chemicals (Salicylates, Amines and Glutamates). Bitters, turmeric, ginger, herbals are all high in different ones. The most safe over the counter pro-kinetic is magnesium citrate. \n\nIn my case, *the underlining reason I felt symptomatic and kept getting SIBO over and over was due to a sensitivity to one of these chemical groups. Removing it stopped my SIBO coming back, removed 70% of my symptoms and greatly increased the quality of my life.*\n\n# A GI Map was useful to me\n\nA GI Map is a detailed report into the different strains of bacterial. Mine allowed me to see specific strains and gave me vital information. It told me I had high Zonulin levels which is linked to intestinal permeability, it told me I had missing Butyric Acid creating strains, missing oxalate-killing strains and it generally gave me a targeted probiotic regiment. Now you'll find whether it's this subreddit, or the various other gut related ones, a room full of dieticians, doctors or even functional doctors. No one agrees on whether probiotics are good or bad for different things. I can say having extensively experimented with them that s.boulardi is the only safe one I tried and that depending on the strain I found specific use in specific ones and also found that too much would be bad. I wont give specifics but my GI map showed me that I had some strains missing, finding specific supplements for those strains helped. Whilst avoiding the 'full spectrum/complex' ones I was able to target specific strains and in that was I was able to do what I call do 'targeted responsible supplementation'. My functional road to recovery was so nuanced and messy it's hard to know whether doing this helped me or not. If I had to decide I would say it did help me but there was no smoking gun. With the exception of s.boulardii I think the only other simple strain that helped me as an individual who was lacking in it is lactobacillus longum. But soil based/spore based, reuteri, symprove, bio-kult none of these helped me significantly. \n\n\nIf you have the access, resources and time. A GI Map with a knowledgable dietician is probably going to help you. I didn't have that, I was able to self fund a GI Map and by supplements.\n\n# Chronic Stress and the Vagus nerve \n\nI personally had adrenal fatigue due to overwhelming stress on my body. I got out of it with light exercise, yoga, a cocktail of adaptogens and regular mindfulness. It was VERY annoying and boring. I had to cut out stressful or stimming activities (fast paced gaming) and I had to learn to breathe from my stomach and activate my diaphragm. I had to identify and habitually remove unconscious muscle tensing and stimming. I had to be very responsible with caffeine and I had to be patient. It was very time consuming and a commitment but I was in such a bad state that I simply had to do it. I ended up with a very useful set of simple tricks.\n\n1. [This video](https://youtu.be/zUx5kLFyx-M?t=430) pushing the belly button. \n\n2. Closing eyes and looking fully right \n\n3. Making sure I got high quality sleep by using magnesium glycinate\n\n4. Breathe out longer than I breathed in\n\nNumber 1 in particular but many of these things would audibly reward me with gastro activity. I could feel my parasympathetic nervous system telling my body to engage motility. \n\n# Supplements\n\nBecause herbals are full of food chemicals that one could either get too much exposure to or already is sensitive to, I can't earnestly recommend them to anyone who has even the faintest suspicion they have leaky-gut/intestinal permeability. Though, I tried them, all the best ones. I did multiple courses and none of them were as effective as Rifaximin for me. Though, I believe to someone who has light SIBO and is sure of no leaky gut they may be useful. But food sensitivities to chemicals happen when you overexpose your self to them with leaky gut (citation needed). So be careful with them.\n\nThese supplements have been essential to me;\n\n* s.boulardii\n\n* tributyrin and phosphatidylcholine  \n\n* vitamins (d3, k2, active-b-complex), high dose active thiamine TTFD\n\n* minerals (zinc picolinate), magnesium (malate for dietary, citrate for motility, glycinate for sleep, I used sporadically) \n\n* milk thistle, glutatione \n\n* Omega 3\n\nBut most of all by a significant stretch MSM (sulphur) (methysulfonlmethan/domethysuffon) \n\nThis changed my stools from soft to formed and improved my wellbeing. There's a huge caveat here that if you supplement sulphur you need to make sure you don't have hydrogen sulphate SIBO. MSM might be so useful to me because I have a salicylate sensitivity and sulphur is an ingredient that helps create the enzymes that break down that food chemical. \n\nS.Boulardii was well tolerated by my body even during the overgrowth. None of my gastroentogists advised against it as it's non-collonising. It supposedly helps dysbiosis, motility and intestinal permeability.\n\nThe vitamins are there to make sure I had enough because we don't get enough from out diet if we have dysbiosis and SIBO. Blood tests help inform me; in my case I needed active B supplements because I am 1/3 people who have a MTHFR mutation. Please visit the /r/MTHFR subreddit before private messaging me about it, or if you don't mind searching my history. B vitamins in particular are going to be super useful because you will lack energy and you're be under stress in your detox pathways as well as your liver. Active b vitamins are a great tool for these. \n\nZinc helps intestine health and leaky gut. \n\nThiamine TTFD can help symptoms of fatigue and is an important coenzyme for bodily processes that fight chronic illness.\n\nMSM has a wellness quality of life effect for people with chronic illnesses I don't know much about that other than supporting sulphur pathways is essential for detox. But I personally took MSM for theory I had that I was lacking in intestinal mucous and boy, as much as I could have hoped to be proven right, I was. I immediately noticed more formed stools and I have a lot of stools that passed without needing to wipe. I think there's a special connection to MSM for sibo people so I am interested in your anecdotes if you've tried it. I've not seen it once mentioned for SIBO on this sub or anywhere else. \n\nTributyrin was the best form of butyrate acid I found worked for me. For those that don't know, Butyrate is the holy grail of intestinal health and wellbeing. Unfortunately it's really hard to deliver it to your intestines intact, for that reason it's essential you find a good supplement I personally found Tributyrin 350 from Apex Energetics was good. However in theory if you have good intestinal flora those bacteria will generate the butyric acid for you. \n\nOmega 3 is one of the only anti-inflammatory supplements that I can tolerate with food sensitivities. \n\n## Tree cut summary\n\nPutting everything together then. I would have a course of rifaximin with s.boulardi then I would stay on a low fodmap diet. I would then take targeted probiotics based on my GI map but not vitally important. I would then be very open to any bodily changes or 'poisonings' and I would check the food chemicals and find out that I had a sensitivity. If I needed to return to a base, I would jump onto carnivore for 3 days to stop the potential fermentation before it got big. I would avoid the food chemical glutamine/amine or salicylate that triggered me and then only after a good period of good health look to SLOWLY introduce it. I avoided sugar but reintroduced later, I incorporated dietary fibre in bananas, safe vegetables and grains like sorghum or even PHHG to stay regular. I would only take magnesium citrate if I felt constipated. For me, all the branches became manageable once I starved them of the overgrowth *AND* food chemical I was sensitive to. Doing only one or the other didn't work, I needed to do both. This is how I've been SIBO clear for a year and a half. \n\n## Current state\n\nI was so bad with sibo and my chronic tree that even a year and a half later I am not healed. And I can tell that my situation is still precarious. But I am armed now with the previous paragraph where I can stop an overgrowth forming (or at leas that's how it feels) by slamming on the breaks, avoiding specific foods and keeping my motility up. Utilising the belly button pressing technique and staying healthy with exercise and eating as diverse a set of foods as I can with the options I have I am able to live a healthy life. My body is still healing and it's hard to sit here even with all the hard work and steps given to tell you that but the truth is; if you get yourself into the state I was in it just is that bad and will take time. \nThere's a plethora of bad habits and coping mechanisms that I used to get through the bad times and now it's hard to shake those. I feel like Red in Shawshank redemption where he's finding it's hard to integrate again with normal society having been in such a dark and controlled place. My quality of life is still low but it's absolutely much much better. For me the food chemicals and supplements knowledge was the smoking gun. Only with those was a Rifaximin course successful. Gut health has many facets, you can't fix only one you need a holistic approach. The problem is, the professionals helping you are specifically looking at once branch at a time. The missing link is you, or a guide like this one but written specifically for you. \n\n## TLDR\n\nCheck for sensitivities to salicylates amines and glutamates by checking the foods and seeing if your [list of trigger foods](https://alessandraedwards.com/foods-high-in-salicylates-amines-and-glutamates/) align to one of them. Assume Leaky Gut is real and supplement for it, check my supplement section. Poke your belly button 50 times deep enough you feel it hit a tender nerve, keep a mental food diary.\n\n## Takeaways \n\n* I consider the majority of symptoms to be associated with food sensitivities or other 'knock on' illness from SIBO in the body and not necessarily direct SIBO symptoms. \n\n* Secondary/tertiary illnesses from SIBO likely contributed to getting reoccurring SIBO again\n\n* Prolonged adrenal issues or stress from food sensitivities compounds motility issues and compromises intestinal walls. Food sensitivities linger after SIBO is treated and cause havok to the intestines making them prime for another overgrowth. It is ESSENTIAL to have high confidence you know you can safely include not just FODMAPS but other food chemicals in the next point.\n\n* Understanding if you have food sensitivities to [Amines](https://naturopathlife.com.au/education/nutrition-perth/amine-sensitivity/), [Glutamates](https://www.webmd.com/diet/high-glutamate-foods) or [Salicylates](https://www.dietvsdisease.org/salicylate-intolerance/). Go through the list of foods by clicking each one and seeing if you see trigger foods.\n\n* My additive safe list is Stevia, guar gum, phgg, very limited xanthan gum (especially in liquids), limited Aspartame\n\n* My additive avoid list is corn syrup, sorbitol, xylitol and erythritol.",

Somehow, without the money to afford a specialist, over the years I came to a lot of the same conclusions as you did with the supplements that helped me feel best, methyl-b complex, milk thistle, s. boulardii, msm, glutathione. My primary Dr made me feel like a hypochondriac taking all these supplements, when really I’m struggling to make it through every day. I cut back on the b complex and probiotic to save money recently and the fatigue I’ve been feeling is quite numbing. I am reacting to salami I ate the other day as well and have thoroughly learned my lesson. Hopefully when I climb back out of this hole I will be able to quit caffeine and heal my adrenals.

My Dr told me to stop taking it and go see a psychiatrist. I did stop - psychiatrist wouldn’t give me meds because she said could cause more GI issues. So seeing a therapist (not much help there….I think I got more from your post. lol). Found a new GI Dr … he put me on Alina because stool test showed non pathogenic parasite. 3 days on Alinia, l-glutamine, SPI protect which is an immunoglobulin. I don’t think the Alina did much but immunoglobulin seem to help form stools. Also take creon because stool test also showed very low enzymes production. \nSo diagnosis is hydrogen sibo, very low enzymes, possible Lyme (some positive bands) , hoshimoto thyroid. \nSo do you think it was a mistake to stop the xifaxin and is it save to start it again? Just feeling so depleted it I know I will heal everything one day! I feel it’s all connected. Also thoughts on parasites?",

I can't handle any stress and became recluse. It morphed to dizziness and burping. Which stopped when estrogen declined. I don't have the shoulder neck muscle tension since my 50s so hormones are part of this high unchecked estrogen. Use progesterone to offset high estrogen. High estrogen causes sluggish liver gallbladder and bile. My diet shrunk to raw organic plant foods and it seems to not cause the balloon air gut. I just learned from Biomesight that i have bilophilia wadsworthia oxalates and leaky gut so probably hydrogen sulfide sibo. Just want to mention people do a stratgene report. I found out I am PEMT ++ which means i need choline. Without enough choline your liver will not function and could be a big part of the problem.  So I take sunflower lecithin phosphatidlyl choline. Also check methylation folate and B12. My b12 always sky high not getting into the cells maybe.

        "body": "Wow this is an awesome and informative post! Wish I had of seen it 2 years ago when I was researching a similar path. This enzyme pathway you are talking about is called the Phenolsulfotransferase Enzyme Pathway or PST Enzyme Pathway for short. It’s a Phase 2 Detox Pathway. Where we metabolise Salicylates/Phenols/Sulfur along with other things. It has different stages, the part you mostly talk about is called “Sulphation”. Where we turn our Sulfur into Sulfites then into Sulphate. It’s the Sulphate part that we end up lacking and it impacts our guts. We need enough Sulphate for our gut lining so we don’t get leaky gut and to make enough digestive enzymes.\n\nSounds like you didn’t have a problem in converting your sulfur to sulfites then to sulphate but maybe just needed a lot more sulfur using the MSM. For the ppl that have problems with sulfur intolerance symptoms and converting their sulfur into sulphate which may make you react to the MSM Epsom Salts are useful as it has a Sulphate component. I’m talking about bathing in it or putting your feet in a bucket of water with it, not digesting it. It'll give you diarrhoea. This can bypass the fault and deliver some Sulphate directly. This won’t work for everyone, some ppl are really sensitive. You start low and slow.\nYou need enough Sulphate to metabolise Salicylates and Phenols.\n\nAnyway great post, just thought I’d add some more light to it for ppls research purposes.",

However, I didn't get along with tamanu oil in the past (this serum contains 10%) so I'd hesitate to purchase this without trying it out first. \n\nOn a superficial level I love the pump bottle + the aesthetics and the fact that it's 40ml. And Krave Beauty will also donate 2% of every sale of the GBR serum to a foundation that protects the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia! Overall I'm really interested to read the reviews for this product :)\n\n*Edit: percentages and COSDNA link*\n\n*Edit 2: here’s the YouTube video introducing the product (https://youtu.be/q_HcZm9OjJ8). It has a few before and after pics towards the end*",

It also seems weird to me that there would be lactic acid in this, as it can be bad for some with sensitive skin (which you’d think this product would want to be totally safe for) and according to the Simple Skincare Science post on repairing your barrier ( https://simpleskincarescience.com/dehydrated-skin-moisture-barrier-acne-fix/ ) would want to avoid all chemical exfoliants for a month at least while you are letting it repair and before you start to add a chemical exfoliants back in. So it’s odd to me that this would have lactic acid in it, instead of just being a super repairing moisturizer that anyone can use no matter what other actives they already use. I am on a Curology script for Tret and I’d be wary of over exfoliating with this as it has the lactic acid in it, but if it didn’t I’d love to be able to use a super moisturizing and barrier strengthening product after my Tret! 🤔",

Also because I have been doing nothing but doomscrolling for the past several days, my sense of time is completely shot and I don’t remember anything I did or when I did the few things I did do.\n\nBut on the flip side, I finally got the ingredients to make gluten free bread, and it actually turned out extremely well! A little denser and dryer than gluten bread, but it was still pretty soft and had a good taste! I could honestly have passed them off as decent gluten bread, as I’ve definitely eaten way worse. (If you are gluten free and want to make bread, you should check out The Loopy Whisk’s breads. The ingredients are expensive (mainly the psyllium husk and the xanthan gum), but the recipes use very little of them so they will last. The recipes themselves are also very straightforward and easy to follow, and yield extremely good gluten free bread.)",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

I imagine it would perform really well under makeup, or for someone with oily skin. For myself it wouldn’t be enough alone. I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af.

So I thought maybe the scar stick could be an interesting thing to try. It’s amazing. I do feel like it’s been helping even if just to be an extra occlusive layer. But I feel like my marionette lines have faded a little bit with consistent use. Sometimes I even use it as an occlusive layer over my lip balm. Idk it’s a really interesting multi stick. I could see it being a cool makeup primer.",

    "body": "I personally think that the healthcare conspiracy is the largest ongoing scheme, completely aside from the pandemic. I would like to showcase in this post some of my research on food, artificial ingredients and their health impact. We are in the middle of what multiple papers refer to as **the twenty-first century cancer epidemic caused by obesity** (1). Every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, closely followed by obesity and related illness. The prevalence of obesity nearly tripled between 1975 and 2016. About 18 million people die every year from cardiovascular disease, for which diabetes and hypertension are major predisposing factors. Today, more than 1.7 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and 312 million of them are obese (2).\n\nWe all know fast food is not healthy, but that's not what this is about. This is about general store-bought items, packaged foods that are highly processed and contain questionable substances and chemicals.\n\nI bet everyone reading this post, including myself, has one or more products at home that contain\n\n- aspartame\n- Ace-K\n- sucralose\n- locust bean gum\n\nThese ingredients are all approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and over 6,000 food and beverage products, ranging from diet soft drinks to low-calorie yoghurt, jams, desserts, juices, chewing gum and sugar-free condiments contain these thickeners and sweeteners.\n\n**1.Aspartame** is sold under the brand names NutraSweet and Equal. It’s used widely in packaged products, especially those labeled as “diet” or sugar free foods.\n\nThe ingredients of aspartame are aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Both are naturally occurring amino acids. When the body processes aspartame, part of it is broken down into methanol. As of 2014, aspartame was the largest source of methanol in the American diet (5). Methanol is not toxic in small quantities. However, a study has been able to link a higher dietary methanol intake during pregnancy to the prevalence of autism. 550 women ingested 66.71 mg. of methanol weekly and 161 women more than double, 142.31 mg. The group of 161 women gave birth to an autistic child. (5, 6)\n\nFree methanol is present in some foods and is also created when aspartame is heated. Free methanol consumed regularly may be a problem because it breaks down into formaldehyde, a known carcinogen and neurotoxin, in the body (7).\n\n**2.Sucralose and Ace-K** are unfortunately not researched enough. One study done on mice found that Ace-K caused weight gain and shifts in the gut microbiome, which could potentially lead to obesity and chronic inflammation (8). The FDA recommends using a maximum of 15 milligrams of Ace-K per one kilogram of your body weight each day. For a 132-pound person, this equates to 0.9 grams of acesulfame potassium in a day. To compare sweetness levels, that would equate to around 200 grams, or half a pound of sugar, per day.\n\nThis is an issue because it might desensitize the body to overly sweet foods, which contain little food energy in calories and in turn trigger the body to \"save\" rather than burn fat (10). People who consume [diet drinks which contain] these artificial sweeteners \"may be more likely to have a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problems, according to research to be presented at the American College of Cardiology's 63rd Annual Scientific Session.\" (11) \n\n\"Besides its benefits, animal studies have convincingly proven that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, brain tumors, bladder cancer and many other health hazards. Some kind of health related side effects including carcinogenicity are also noted in humans\" (9).  \n\nChronic **sucralose** consumption induces elevation of serum insulin in young healthy adults (12). \"A Single 48 mg Sucralose Sip Unbalances Monocyte Subpopulations and Stimulates Insulin Secretion in Healthy Young Adults\" (13). This can lead to higher blood-sugar levels and subsequently diabetes. Diabetes is rampant, with 382 million people living with diabetes in 2013, the World Health Organization declared the condition as being epidemic. Annual per capita healthcare costs for people with diabetes are **three to four times** greater than for individuals without diabetes (3).\n\nIn 2019, diabetes was the ninth leading cause of death with an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly caused by diabetes. (4)\n\nDiabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. (4)\n\n**3.Locust bean gum** is a thickener, which is often found in inexpensive, pre-packaged products. As recent as of July 2021, many products containing locust bean gum, xanthan gum and other thickeners were recalled from the market in Europe because the maximum residue levels for ethylene oxide were exceeded (14, 22). Ethylene oxide is classified by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) as a mutagen, carcinogen and a reproductive toxicant (15). While it is safe to consume vegetable gum like guar gum or locust bean/carob gum, it is often made cheaply. It is extracted from the seeds of the carob tree, low-cost production in third-world countries and poor quality control is believed to have caused the contamination. \n\nSources:\n\n1: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23983688/\n2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068646/\n3: https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-016-0186-9\n4: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes\n5: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987715002443#b0005\n6: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279884117_Dietary_methanol_and_autism\n7: https://www.healthline.com/health/aspartame-side-effects#side-effects\n8: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5464538/\n9: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198517/\n10: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18535548/\n11: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140329175110.htm\n12: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284053/\n13: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6512026/\n14: https://www.bilacon.com/ethylene-oxide-food-products/\n15: https://www.fsai.ie/faq/ethylene_oxide.html\n16: https://resources.selerant.com/food-regulatory-news/fsai-alerts-withdrawal-of-food-additive-locust-bean-gum-e410-in-certain-food-products-due-to-ethylene-oxide-contamination\n\nAlso data used from:\n\n17: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/the-complicated-truth-behind-aspartame/article16069158/#\n18: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/artificial-sweeteners-fact-sheet\n19: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/faqs/what-is-aspartame\n20: https://www.ehow.co.uk/about_5455483_side-effects-phedracut.html\n21: https://supersweetblog.wordpress.com/list-of-products-containing-aspartame/\n22: https://affidiajournal.com/en/ethylene-oxide-in-ice-cream-over-100-brands-involved-in-france\n23: https://www.livestrong.com/article/314356-the-harmful-side-effects-of-guar-gum/\n24: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet\n25: https://ourworldindata.org/cancer\n26: https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics\n\n\nThe info I found that suggest these chemicals are safe, is either published or indirectly funded by companies that sell products with these ingedrients such as Danone, Weight Watchers and Coca Cola (19). When looking for organic alternatives, I found that natural thickeners like red algae agar, apple pectin and sweeteners like stevia leafs could replace all of these ingredients with little to no risks (but probably at higher cost).\n\nFor those reasons, I think it is evident that the food and beverage industry \n\n- knowingly tolerates ingredients that pose health risks\n\n- deliberately keeps those ingredients in products where a substitute can be offered\n\nThis is supported by the US **healthcare industry** which is massive, with healthcare spending accounting for over 19.7% of US GDP in 2020. National health spending is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent for 2019-28 and to reach $6.2 trillion by 2028. (24)\n\nCui bono?\n\nNever forget how cigarettes were advertised as healthy for decades. How cocaine, chloroform and heroin were used as common medical remedies. How we insulated our walls and appliances with asbestos. How people were ecstatic about nuclear power for their house and car.\n\n...and then the companies who made billions off of it are all surprised when they stumble upon the research, it's always \"ah we didn't know better back then\" or \"we thought this was safe\". In this day and age, with our access to information, we should know better and demand these companies also know better.",

    "body": "**Liquid Gold Review, or: How I learned overexfoliation is a bad thing**\n\n**TL;DR:** If your moisture barrier is damaged, this stuff will seriously change your life. Support an up-and-coming indie shop and repair your moisture barrier, all without breaking your wallet.\n\n**Background:** I recently upped my skincare game considerably through the infinite wisdom and patience of r/SkincareAddiction and r/AsianBeauty. I’ve always been both a science nerd (currently working myself through a Masters program to be a physician assistant) and a product junkie, and those two things have gloriously collided over the last few months to the benefit of my skin! The AB side bar has an excellent list of blogs, one of which I fell way down deep into is The Acid Queen. Alli, who runs the blog, is a seriously impressive DIY’er, which allowed me to get involved in her guinea pig pool for testing product formulations she was currently tinkering with. I’ve spent the last five weeks testing her moisture barrier repair moisturizer, Liquid Gold, and here are my thoughts! The formatting of these sections is shamelessly ripped from bloggers whose reviewing formats I admire: Fiddy Snails, Skin & Tonics, Fan-B, Snow, and of course, Her Majesty The Acid Queen Herself ;)\n\n**What it’s supposed to do:** Liquid Gold is a moisture barrier repair moisturizer/emulsion. (For more info on what a moisture barrier is, see Skin & Tonics excellent moisture barrier post linked in the sources.) Liquid Gold takes your thinned out, red, overexfoliated, stinging, weakened skin and makes it supple, bouncy, strong, and able to tolerate some serious heavy-lifting from acids and actives. It accomplishes all this with the magic of CERAMIDES *oooh ahhhh*\n\n**How to use it:** We’ve got two recommended options here. The first is a thin layer all over your face as the first occlusive step of…well, however many of those you have. The second is a thicker layer as a deeper moisturizing sleeping pack of sorts. I’ve been going with option 1, twice a day every day, AM and PM. Its consistency is slightly thicker than a serum, but not as thick as a gel cream or oily despite the ingredients list (more on that in a moment). It’s BRIGHT yellow-orange from the sea buckthorn, but spreads pretty easily and only leaves the tiiiiniest yellow cast after I’ve spread it in. However, my paleness makes Casper the ghost look like a tanning bed addict, so I imagine on most other skin tones it wouldn’t be visible at all. One of the things I love about this product is how quickly it dries down. I’m (gleefully) looking down the barrel at 15+ steps in my PM routine, so anywhere I don’t have to wait for dry time, I’m a happy camper. I don’t wear makeup often, but I’ve brought it out a number of days to see how Liquid Gold plays under makeup. I’m pleased to say it holds up just fine, without makeup settling into fine lines, caking, or otherwise disintegrating throughout the day.\n\n[**Here's some photos of it in action!**](http://imgur.com/a/knjp4)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (Aqua), Propylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-3 Methyglucose Distearate, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Panthenol, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Squalane (olive-derived), Cetyl Alcohol, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** Oh, man…all of them?! This ingredients list is STRAIGHT FIRE if we are talking moisture barrier repair. Let’s break that down, shall we? I’m going to limit my highlights because otherwise I will literally never finish this review.\n\n**Ceramide Complex** (Ceramide NP, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP; Phytosphingosine; Cholesterol): The Beauty Brains, another fabulous “science of skincare” blog, has a great discussion of ceramides (see sources for link) and describes them so: “Ceramides form a kind of water-proofing barrier in the upper layers of skin. They’re not only critical for helping skin retain water but they also help repair the skin’s natural barrier and regulate cells. Ceramide production dwindles with age which can result in dry skin, wrinkles and even some types of dermatitis.” The other important thing to know about ceramides is that they are team players. Ceramides without fatty acids and cholesterol won’t get you very far. Specifically, ceramides penetrate best with a mixture of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% fatty acids. So maybe you’ll find a product with ceramide floating around in the ingredient list, but good luck finding one with all three players…and if you do, cross your fingers they’re in the optimal ratio. Except that’s exactly what we have in Liquid Gold. Hell yes.\n\n**Niacinamide:** Why hello, my old friend! I’ll let the Queen herself explain the wonders for niacinamide: “One of the most studied skincare ingredients, niacinamide does everything: smooths fine lines and wrinkles, increases ceramide and fatty acid synthesis, regulates skin cell turnover, fades hyperpigmentation, evens skin tone, and has powerful anti-inflammatory properties.” Naturally then, it seems like niaciamide is in errything these days, but who knows how much is in there? Niacinamide is most effective at 3-5%, so unless the percentage is disclosed, we’re left stacking niacinmide products to reach that threshhold. Liquid Gold has 4%, which happens to be the same amount you’d get if this ingredient was included in a Curology prescription. Jackpot.\n\n**Sea Buckthorn:** Again, from The Beauty Brains: “[Sea buckthorn is] known for being rich in a number of bioactive compounds, including the following: vitamins A, B1, B2, C, D, K, and P; omega 3, 6, 7, and 9; 43 lipids, organic acids, amino acids, folic acids, tocopherols, flavonoids, phenols, terpenes, tannins, [and] 20 mineral elements.” Okay…but what does all that do for your skin? Well, we’ve got some studies that show all that goodness adds up to improved wound healing, protection from UV damage, and increased collagen production (see sources for link).\n\n**Rose Hip Oil:** High in oleic and linoleic acids, both of which are polyunsaturated fatty acids important for the integrity and regeneration of skin cell membranes. More moisture barrier magic going on here, my friends.\n\n**Okay, but seriously…**everything in this ingredients list is AMAZING. And rightly so, that’s the whole idea behind DIY in the first place: if you make it yourself, you know everything is there for a reason without any fluff or fillers.\n\n**How it worked:** And here’s where the other part of the title of this post comes into play. I have a long and glorious history of overexfolating my skin because…well, basically because that’s what I thought I was supposed to do. Physical exfoliants, all sorts of acids, inappropriately high strength retinoids…I would throw them all at my face at once every single day until literally my whole top layer of skin peeled off in sheets in the shower and I was shiny and red as a cherry. Even normally gentle products would sting like the devil, and I never questioned it because I honestly thought that’s how it was supposed to work. I’d fry the life out of my skin until I couldn’t handle it (so like 3-4 straight days of all this), then take a break for a week, maybe less, and then I’d start all over again. It was a roller coaster, let me tell you, and I did this for years. \n\nThen I found this post on FutureDerm that totally blew my mind about setting a schedule for building tolerance to retinoids (see sources for link). So I mapped out my schedule for all 24 weeks and promised myself I would be patient. I went without actives for over a month, then took another crack at one night with lower strength Tazorac, my drug of choice. Disappointingly, I still peeled like a snake for the next three days, despite babying my skin before and after the Tazorac. The next week, the same thing. I was beginning to doubt the wisdom of the retinoid tolerance schedule.\n\nEnter Liquid Gold.\n\nI got on Alli’s testing list and got a bottle in the mail soon after. I am not exaggerating when I say this is literally the most amazing shit I have ever put on my face in my life. Redness starting receding within days. A night with retinoids was no longer followed with peeling, pain, redness, or stinging — all of my hallmarks of a compromised moisture barrier. I tentatively and slowly moved through increasing the frequency of the retinoid. Once, twice, three times, four times a week, two interminable week periods per increase. So far, so good. I can feel fairly confident that Liquid Gold is the responsible party here since the rest of my non-actives routine stayed stable while I was tinkering with how to reintroduce them after my hiatus. Gradually, I added all my actives back in so that now, here’s what I’ve got going on my face: 1) Tazorac 0.05% gel 4x/week; 2) Curology 0.009% tretinoin, 9% azelaic acid, 1% clindamycin every night; 3) Paula’s Choice Resist 2% BHA morning and night; 4) Timeless 20% Vitamin C+E Ferulic Acid serum (AM only).\n\nEvery time I wash my face, I think today will be the day I finally overdo it and start feeling my barrier damaged again. BUT NO. My skin feels strong, bouncy, resilient, and looks glowing. My husband pokes me in the face, nods knowingly, and declares, “Chok chok.” He’s right. Now, I’ve been throw actives at my face like there’s no tomorrow and my face takes it like a champ. Eventually, I’m hoping to add in an AHA and up my Tazorac to 0.1%, but my schedule says I’m not allowed to do that for another few months. I’m glowing like the goddamn North Star thanks to all those actives, and I can keep coming back for more thanks to the almost surreal talents of Liquid Gold.\n\nI started to panic a bit the closer I got to the end of my bottle since this was a DIY formula since I absolutely had neither time time nor inclination to whip up a batch myself and didn’t know what I would do when I ran out. The day before I was about to email Alli and beg her to keep making me some forever in exchange for my first born child, SHE OPENED HER OWN SHOP ONLINE!!! This is the best news my skin has ever had. I immediately purchased a 60 mL glass pump bottle of Liquid Gold for $24 from Stratia, The Acid Queen’s shop website. After having such a fabulous experience with this, you better believe I threw Rewind, her DMAE serum, into my cart with a quickness. \n\n**Conclusion:** This shit is my life now. It let’s me go active-crazy without unduly compromising my moisture barrier and makes my skin feel stronger than it has in my entire life. It’s affordable, pleasant to use day and/or night, well-formulated, conscientiously packaged, and made in-house by a fellow skincare junkie on the other side of the country. I couldn’t be happier to love this product and have the opportunity to support her shop.\n\n[Stratia Skin, Liquid Gold, $24](https://www.stratiaskin.com/collections/skincare/products/liquid-gold)\n\n*Disclosure: I was asked to write a review of this product that was originally intended only for Alli to read for formulation feedback and my experience with the product. I only decided to write it for public consumption when I realized she was opening the shop and other people could get this product. I did not accept the product with an agreement to review it positively, nor have I received any monetary compensation for doing so. All opinions expressed above are my own.*\t\n\n**Sources**\n[The Beauty Brains: Is sea buckthorn oil good for skin?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2014/07/is-sea-buckthorn-oil-good-for-skin/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Is rose hip oil good for anti-aging?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/01/is-rose-hip-oil-good-for-anti-aging/)\n[The Beauty Brains: Are ceramides good anti-aging ingredients?](http://thebeautybrains.com/2015/04/are-ceramides-good-anti-aging-ingredients-episode-77/)\n[Stratia Skin: Liquid Gold](https://stratiaskin.com/products/liquid-gold)\n[Skin & Tonics: The Importance of Fatty Acids, pH & the Moisture Barrier: How I Eliminated my Acne & Decreased my Skin Sensitivity](http://skinandtonics.com/the-importance-of-fatty-acids-ph-moisture-barrier-how-i-eliminated-my-acne-decreased-my-skin-sensitivity/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Beginners Recipe Shopping List](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/02/16/fun-with-diy-beginners-recipe-shopping-list/)\n[The Acid Queen: Fun with DIY: Moisture Barrier Serum](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2015/11/03/fun-with-diy-moisture-barrier-serum/)\n[FutureDerm: 11 Things You Never Knew about Retinol and Retinoids Until Now](https://www.futurederm.com/11-things-you-never-knew-about-retinol-and-retinoids-until-now/)",

I just wanted to add some  impressions and my skin type.\n\nI have dry, sensitive, always-red skin with hormonal acne. I tested Liquid Gold on half my face for two weeks and it didn't cause any visible changes. No increase in acne, no miraculous redness reduction. I find it very minimally moisturizing. My skin still feels dry and tight after letting it sink in (which I agree happens quickly) and I have to follow it with a heavier moisturizer (or three.) There is just a tiny amount of stickiness and little to no slip after it dries/absorbs.\n\nI, too, have been trying to find a way to use actives without over-exfoliating. Daily use of a mild BHA and AHA has proven too harsh in the past, so I've been increasing in frequency very  slowly and now I'm up to every other day with no discomfort or peeling, even when combining BHA and AHA and using my stronger products.\n\nI'm really happy with Liquid Gold and see myself using it indefinitely. The price and ingredients speak for themselves, and the packaging is really nice too. One last thing I just thought of: I was showing it to my mom and she had an irritated spot on her hand from a cut or something, so I put this on that spot and she said it was amazingly soothing.",

    "body": "In house \"take out\" Chinese dinner, which I originally posted on a thread on /r/keto lamenting a lack of take out Chinese.  These are my original recipes, but they replicate the flavors I love.  I started cooking Chinese at home pre-keto.  Adapting most recipes is easy if you have xanthan gum around.\n\n**Quick Chinese Chicken Broth**\n\nPrepare this in advance and store it in the fridge.  It's an easy base for the egg drop soup below, hot and sour soup, keto velvet shrimp and pea pods, chicken broccoli, etc. (if you want those recipes I'll add them in the comments)\n\n4 cups canned chicken broth\n\n1 clove minced garlic\n\n1 tbsp chopped ginger\n\n1 tbsp soy sauce\n\nBoil gently on medium high heat for five minutes.  Strain out solids.  Stores in fridge for a week.\n\n**Easy Peanut Sauce**\n\n1 cup Chinese chicken broth\n\n1 clove minced garlic\n\n1 tbsp minced ginger\n\n1 finely chopped scallion\n\n1 finely ground dried *small* Chinese chili pepper\n\n1 tbsp soy sauce\n\n2 tbsp natural peanut butter\n\n1/4 tsp xanthan gum\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nCombine in sauce pan over low heat.  Stir until incorporated.\n\n**Quick Keto Kung Bao Chicken**\n\n2 tbsp peanut oil\n\n2 chicken breasts, cut into thin strips\n\n1/4 cup chopped onion\n\n1/4 cup chopped celery\n\n1/4 cup blanched peanuts\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nBring oil to temperature in non-stick skillet.  Add chicken and sauté vigorously for four minutes.  Add onion and celery, sauté for additional two minutes.  Add peanuts.\n\nCover in peanut sauce.  Cover, and simmer on low heat for five minutes.\n\nServe over cauliflower rice.\n\n**Easy Egg Drop Soup**\n\n4 cups of Chinese chicken broth\n\n1/4 tsp xanthan gum\n\n1/8 tsp each salt and pepper\n\n2 egg yolks\n\n4 whole eggs, whisked with fork.\n\nWhisk two egg yolks into cool broth and stir gently on medium low heat  Add xanthan gum, salt, and pepper.  When soup is beginning to boil slowly add beaten whole eggs, using the handle of a mixing spoon to stir the soup vigorously as you're adding the eggs.\n\nServe (serves 2 - 4, depending on portion size).\n\n**Garlic Mushrooms**\n\n1 tbsp peanut oil\n\n1 clove minced garlic\n\n8 ounces baby portobellos, quartered\n\n1 tbsp soy sauce\n\n1/4 cup warm water\n\n1/8 tsp xanthan gum\n\nsalt and pepper to taste\n\nWhisk xanthan gum into water and sit aside.  In a skillet, bring oil to temperature over medium high heat.  Add garlic.  Add mushrooms.  Sauté vigorously for two minutes. Add soy sauce.  Add water and xanthan gum mixture.\n\n**EDIT**: Lots of little edits on this to make it more coherent.  One problem, the recipes under the Chinese chicken broth recipe need five cups of Chinese chicken broth.  You can make the Chinese chicken broth recipe with five cups of chicken broth -- just boil it for ten minutes instead of five to extract more flavor.  It will easily stretch to provide adequate liquid for the recipes below it.",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won’t meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That’s the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won’t be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there’s a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ❤️",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

I think it's very important people take the time to learn what different ingredients are for (retinol, AHAs, BHAs, etc.), which ones should be in dark bottles/stored in certain temperatures, avoid damaging/irritating your skin by mixing ones that shouldn't be applied together, etc. Your skin is an organ so I think it's important to keep educating yourself and protect your skin!",

I’m currently using the glow recipe watermelon moisturizer dupe which has niacinamide. I don’t know the quality of the niacinamide nor the percentage but for 1.25 I’m willing to try it since I’m not relying on it solely for an active ingredient. I prefer moisturizers with niacinamide when I can find them at DT. To me this moisturizer is meh - the packaging is nice since it’s a glass jar and it’s 2 oz. But it’s a very “wet” texture which I don’t like because then I can’t apply while my face is still damp which is customary for me. It takes a while to dry too. \n\nAs a side note - does anyone know if you can or need to exfoliate while using Adapalene? The packaging says not to use any other acne product so I just really haven’t really tried it but was curious if anyone knew.",

A quarter will be more than enough for any of you greedy pigs.\n\n5. High protein, low fat, low carb.  Macros for whole cheesecake - Protein 128g, Carbs 44g, Fat 28g - 944 cals.\n\nIngredients:\n\n- Egg whites - 40g\n\n- Greek Yogurt 0% - 360g\n\n- Philadelphia lightest - 360g (If you use full fat you will get a creamier cheesecake at the expense of about an additional 750 calories)\n\n- Eggs - 2\n\n- Protein powder - 50g MyProtein strawberry dessert, which is a mix of proteins, sweetener, wheat gluten and xanthan gum.\n\n- Sweetener - Stevia drops (I used strawberry)\n\nMethod:\n\n- Preheat oven to 160 degrees C\n\n- Mix ingredients together for 5 minutes\n\n- Add to a 7 inch spring tin\n\n- Cook for 30 minutes\n\n- Turn oven down to 90 degrees C\n\n- Cook for further 60 minutes\n\n- Turn off oven, open the door and let the cheesecake cool for 60 minutes\n\n- Take it out of the oven and let it cook for another couple of hours at room temperature then in the fridge for another couple of hours, preferable overnight.  I know you'll want to eat it straight away but trust me, the cooling is what will give the cheesecake it's awesomeness.\n\nEnjoy!!!",

Then combine with the flour and salt.\n2.\tMake cookie shapes.\n3.\tBake at 325 for about 15 minutes, or until cookies are slightly browned. Time will vary depending on how big you made your cookies.\n4.\tWhen cookies are done, move to the refrigerator or freezer while you make the caramel.\n5.\tFor caramel, melt together the butter, erythritol, and honey.\n6.\tOnce combined, let the mixture simmer undisturbed until it’s a nice brown color (probably a wee bit darker than mine in the gif).\n7.\tRemove from heat and add cream.

Coat your cookies in the caramel coconut mixture. Put them back in the fridge or freezer.\n11.\tAre your cookies cool again? Good. Melt your chocolate at 15 second intervals in the microwave, stirring in between, until smooth.\n12.\tUsing a spoon, coat the back of each cookie, then drizzle chocolate over them.\n13.\tChill one more time to harden the chocolate.\n14.\tTell those Girl Scouts to take their delicious cookies and shove them in other people’s faces because fundraising is important so you’ll just donate instead.\n\nMakes about 18 cookies. Per cookie: **140 calories, 13 g fat** 2.8 g protein, 4.4 g carbs, 1.5 g fiber, **2.9 g net carbs**.\n\nAwkwardly enough, I don't even like Samoas.

    "body": "**FROM DEATH’S DOOR TO HEALING: My Secret Weapon and Advice One Year Later**\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFirst off, many of you have already read this so I am going to include some updates real quick before the main article.\n\nIt's winter now and I think it's fair to say that for many of us, we spiral out of control in the winter. I believe this is mainly due to the darkness and here in the states, Daylight Savings Time messing with our circadian rhythms.\n\nMy advice on this one is DO NOT STAY UP LATE, wake up earlier, and buy a happy light. I always went to bed at like 3 or 4 am and woke up late and come Daylight Savings Time, it was always a disaster. But I started going to bed by midnight, waking up at 9, and when I wake up, I go sit in the window where the sunlight is with a happy light 10 inches from my face for about an hour. And if the sun is out, I take off my shirt and get direct sunlight. This changed everything for me. Also, get the free app called f.lux to control the blue light on your screens. It gradually removes blue light the later it gets and this helps control this issue of circadian rhythm.\n\nThe other issue I discovered lately had to do with the pomegranate juice and the berries I suggested. I have to monitor the pom juice, but ESPECIALLY the berries. I still have some every day, but in more moderation. I found that eating too many blueberries in particular has been taking me out. No more than a small handful a day in the salad.\n\nAlso, the coconut milk. You can't let it stay in your fridge for more than a few days or it will grow histamine.\n\nAnyway, here's the main article:\n\nSix months ago, I was on the brink of taking my own life because of this disease. My skin burned and itched and tickled like fire ants were crawling all over me, biting me constantly. I thought I would never sleep again, and I feared I was losing my mind. Nothing I tried was working. But now, I'm stable. I'm healing. And I’m ready to share what I’ve learned to help others who are suffering from this horrendous condition.\n\nAfter battling MCAD for a year, here are a few key takeaways. First, most doctors, even specialists, know shockingly little about the root cause of this disease. Far too many of them are DANGEROUSLY IGNORANT and also ARROGANT when it comes to this topic. In my case, and I stress IN MY CASE, it all came down to leaky gut—a breakdown in the intestinal lining that lets food particles pass into the bloodstream, where the immune system attacks them. You might have something else, like SIBO. But for leaky gut, to heal, you need to understand histamine, histamine liberators, oxalates, sugars, gluten, casein, and lectins. But, if you cut out all those foods, plus do Low FODMAP and low salicylate, you’re left with basically nothing except water and that's a death sentence. The stress of trying to navigate the endless contradictions on the internet was only making the disease worse. I was lost.\n\nBut then I realized something. I realized that, overall, the greatest tool to navigate it all, better than doctors, better than websites or reddit, was ChatGPT. I started using it to track every food, supplement, and medication I was on, and it gave me way better advice than any other source. I asked it to categorize foods by histamine levels, gut health impact, and other factors, and the results were eye-opening.\n\nFor example, I was reacting to apples and told ChatGPT. ChatGPT suggested peeling them. Removing the skin completely. That worked. Now I can eat apples. It’s not perfect, but it’s light years ahead of the brambles of contradictions out there. You just have to be thorough—explain everything and challenge any advice that seems off. Ask it to make sorted lists of things by most to least beneficial or dangerous under those parameters I mentioned earlier. \n\nJust say to ChatGPT “I have leaky gut and histamine intolerance or MCAD. Here are the foods and supplements and drugs I am on. Tell me about each one when it comes to histamine, histamine liberation, oxalates, lectins, gut inflammation, sugar, casein, and gluten. Make me a list of best to worst. Is this good or is this bad? What should I remove, what should I add? How much of this should I be taking? When should I take it?” and so forth. Tell it everything and ask a lot of questions. It’s way better than the websites. \n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nMe: \"ChatGPT. I have leaky gut and MCAD. In terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, casein, sugar, and overall gut inflammation, which is worse for me you think? Tortilla chips made with yellow corn, canola oil, and salt, or shredded mozzarella cheese in a bag?\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Between shredded mozzarella cheese and tortilla chips made with yellow corn, here’s a comparative analysis based on your conditions (leaky gut and MCAD):\n\n# Shredded Mozzarella Cheese\n\n* **Histamine**: Cheese, especially aged varieties, can be high in histamine. Even shredded mozzarella can contain moderate levels due to the dairy fermentation process.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Dairy is a known liberator of histamine, which may provoke symptoms in sensitive individuals.\n* **Lectins**: Cheese does not contain lectins.\n* **Oxalates**: Dairy products are low in oxalates, but some cheeses may have moderate levels.\n* **Casein**: Contains casein, which can be inflammatory for those with dairy sensitivities.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Dairy can contribute to gut inflammation in sensitive individuals, especially in those with leaky gut.\n\n# Tortilla Chips (Yellow Corn)\n\n* **Histamine**: Generally low in histamine.\n* **Histamine Liberators**: Corn is not known to be a liberator.\n* **Lectins**: Contains lectins, which can be problematic for some people, particularly with leaky gut.\n* **Oxalates**: Low in oxalates.\n* **Casein**: Does not contain casein.\n* **Sugar**: Generally low in sugar.\n* **Gut Inflammation**: Corn may cause gut inflammation in some individuals, especially those sensitive to it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n**For your specific conditions:**\n\n* **Cheese** is likely worse for you due to its histamine content, potential to liberate histamine, presence of casein, and inflammatory potential for those with leaky gut.\n* **Tortilla chips** are lower in histamine and do not contain casein, making them a better option, although they may still cause issues due to lectins.\n\nIf you’re managing histamine sensitivity, it would generally be safer to limit or avoid cheese in favor of the tortilla chips, while being mindful of how your body reacts to both. As always, individual responses can vary, so monitoring your symptoms after consumption can provide further clarity.\"\n\n***BTW, if you're really suffering, don't eat EITHER of these!***\n\n**Here's another one for ChatGPT:**\n\nMe: \"I have histamine intolerance/MCAD and leaky gut. I am taking these medications: Zyrtec, montelukast, famotidine, diclofenac. I am trying to figure out if any of these are hurting my gut. Please make a list from most harmful to least and tell me why.\"\n\nChatGPT:\n\n\"Here’s a list of the medications you're taking, from most to least likely to harm your gut, along with explanations:\n\n# 1. Diclofenac (NSAID)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: High\n* **Reason**: Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause irritation to the stomach lining, increase the risk of ulcers, and exacerbate leaky gut. Long-term use of NSAIDs is known to damage the gut barrier and impair healing, which can worsen leaky gut over time.\n\n# 2. Montelukast (Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Moderate\n* **Reason**: Montelukast is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause gastrointestinal side effects like stomach pain, indigestion, or nausea. While it's not known to directly harm the gut lining, its effects on the gastrointestinal system might still aggravate symptoms for those with sensitive digestion or leaky gut.\n\n# 3. Famotidine (H2 Blocker)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low to Moderate\n* **Reason**: Famotidine reduces stomach acid, which can relieve symptoms like acid reflux but may disrupt the natural balance of gut flora over time. Reduced acid levels might also make it harder to digest food properly, which can negatively impact gut health. However, it’s generally safer for the gut compared to NSAIDs.\n\n# 4. Zyrtec (Cetirizine, Antihistamine)\n\n* **Potential Harm**: Low\n* **Reason**: Zyrtec is an antihistamine that’s considered to have minimal impact on gut health. While it can cause mild gastrointestinal side effects (such as nausea or dry mouth), it's not known to cause significant damage to the gut lining.\n\n# Summary:\n\n* **Diclofenac** is the most harmful for your gut due to its potential to irritate the stomach lining and worsen leaky gut.\n* **Montelukast** could cause gastrointestinal issues but is less harmful.\n* **Famotidine** might alter gut flora, though its impact is moderate.\n* **Zyrtec** is the least harmful, with minimal effects on the gut.\n\nIf you're concerned about how these medications affect your gut, it might be worth discussing alternatives with your doctor, especially for diclofenac.\"\n\nI stopped taking Diclofenac because of this and that's a big part of how I began healing.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you shouldn't look at any websites ever, or Reddit, or go to a doctor, but just know that if you do that, you will likely enter a very confusing maze of truth mixed with contradictions, ignorance, and overwhelming information. You can learn a lot that way, but you can also just become instantly lost. Try incorporating ChatGPT to help out.\n\nThe secret to using ChatGPT correctly is to KEEP IT FOCUSED. If you ask \"Make me a low histamine recipe,\" it will possibly make mistakes like telling you to use lemon juice, avocado, or banana. But if you say \"Analyze these specific foods in terms of histamine, histamine liberation, lectins, oxalates, and gut inflammation,\" it generally becomes INCREDIBLY accurate and useful.\n\n# My Healing Process\n\nI was given antibiotics that destroyed my gut biome, and I took diclofenac, which put literal holes in my intestines. I didn’t realize these things were part of the problem. ChatGPT helped me figure that out, and from there, I could work on rebuilding.\n\nI will state that I don't do low salicylate or low FODMAP along with my diets. If I did, like I said, there would only be water left. If you are doing those, tell ChatGPT.\n\nNow, here’s what worked for me, and while everyone’s different, maybe this will help you, too.\n\n# Drugs\n\nWhat I take before bed:\n\n* Zyrtec (Aller-Tec from Amazon or Costco, 365 pills for 20 bucks) (4)\n* Famotidine (2)\n* Montelukast (1) (this one you do need a prescription for)\n* Quercetin with Bromelain (I'm so unsure about this one; if it is good or bad or does nothing at all)\n* Viagra (Sildenafil) No seriously, this one opens the blood vessels and prevents histamine from pooling in certain parts of the body like my hands and head and causing them to burn and itch. When I was at my worst, the pooling was my number one problem. If you have this problem, go to your doctor and ask for sildenafil, the generic for Viagra, which unlike Viagra, is incredibly inexpensive.\n\nI was on Xolair, but it didn’t help me. If it works for you, great, but don’t believe doctors who say Xolair is the “end of the line.” It’s about healing the gut, and doctors just don’t seem to get that in the slightest. I went to three specialists, and all they offered were antihistamines and “avoid tomatoes.” When I asked them about the connection between my gut and the reactions, they looked at me like I was talking about the Loch Ness Monster coming out of my bathtub.\n\n# Supplements\n\nHere's the deal on supplements. **Don't use multivitamins.** Do one thing at a time. And read the ingredients before you buy them. Most vitamin C for example is hard on the gut and is high in histamine and a histamine liberator. And even if you find one that isn't, they will often have extra ingredients like \"citrus bioflavonoids\" or rose hips or sunflower oil or something. Those are also histamine liberators. You have to work to eliminate any little thing that might cause a reaction.\n\nHere’s what worked for me. Remember, introduce supplements ***ONE AT A TIME***\\*\\*.\\*\\* And take them 10-15 minutes before the meal (except for the probiotic, take after as it could be broken down by the betaine HCl). Also, don't buy all of these all at once. Buy the first phase and then work on that for a few weeks and then move on to the next phase.\n\n1. **NatraDAO DAO** (blue box)\n2. **Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl** (if your gut is really hurting, it might be best to start with the one without Betaine HCl and then move up like a month later. I think this supplement is extremely important.)\n3. **Allergy Research Group Magnesium Ascorbate (plain version)** (a safe form of **vitamin C** without histamine-liberating ingredients like rose hip or citrus bioflavonoids)\n4. **Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate**\n5. **Pure Encapsulations Calcium Citrate** (to break down oxalates. Take this one with anything higher oxalate like the sweet potato chips I'll mention in a moment.)\n\nThese next two could take time to add, but they’re crucial:\n\n* **Zinc L-Carnosine**\n* **Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**, **B2 (Riboflavin)**, and **Copper**\n\nFor this next phase, take your time, and monitor your body's reaction to determine if these are worth it for you right now:\n\n* **PE L-Glutamine (switch to powder form after you build up, something like Naked brand)** (slowly build up from say .5 to 5–10 g daily, taking some on an empty stomach. Although be careful. When I got to 10 grams I started negatively reacting to it and went back to 5 where I still currently am. Everyone is going to be different with this. Ideally you should apparently be taking even higher doses like 20 or 30 or 40 grams, but many of us might not be able to handle that. I kind of use it for a few weeks and then don't for a few. My safe spot is now between 0 and 5 grams.)\n* **Seeking Health ProBiota HistaminX** (Build up to two but I wouldn't go beyond that for a while if you are really struggling overall. I'm still trying to figure this one out. Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't.)\n\n# Food and Drink\n\nAs far as this stuff goes, if you are REALLY struggling, like you think you might go insane or die, do a reset, **TAKE AWAY ALL YOUR FOOD** and start here.\n\n* **Water** is your best friend. I prefer sparkling water, and no, the carbon dioxide won’t hurt your gut. Stomach acid converts it back to gas and it leaves via your esophagus. I have a SodaStream. I don't use flavorings.\n* **Coconut milk** (hopefully you can find one WITHOUT additives like B12, a possible histamine liberator). I drink Real Coco. **Do NOT let it remain opened in your fridge for more than a few days or it will mess you up!**\n* **Straight Rooibos Tea** (no additional ingredients besides perhaps grated fresh ginger. This tea is a mast cell stabilizer. I drink it with every meal.)\n* **Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL!**\n* If you are REALLY craving alcohol, like at a party, use **kava from a tincture** in its place.\n* **Don't smoke.** Quit, using nicotine replacement therapy. If you are having cravings, use **nicotine gum** in place of smoking, like at a party or on a trip.\n\nWe'll talk about each of these section as a Phase. Each Phase will likely take several months before adding in the food from the next one.\n\n**PHASE ONE:**\n\nStart simple:\n\n* **White rice** (NON-ENRICHED, the one WITHOUT added vitamins like b12)\n* **Rice noodles** are also a fantastic starch.\n* **Ghee** is amazing for gut health—LOTS of it, especially the refrigerated grass-fed kind. Put it on the rice, the rice noodles, zucchini, veggies, meat, put it on everything.\n* **Zucchini** (But don't let it or any other food cook to the point that it has color or char. At least not for awhile. That makes histamine.\n* **Sea Salt** is a good tool to have. Maybe use the kind WITHOUT iodine, as it may be a histamine liberator for some. Although some people might NEED the iodine.\n\nSlowly add:\n\n* **Asparagus, squash, pumpkin, bok choy, and arugula.**\n* **Gluten-free oatmeal** (Bob's Red Mill)\n* **Fresh herbs** like rosemary, thyme, basil, and tarragon. No marjoram. Double-check each one with ChatGPT.\n\nAnd while leftovers are generally dangerous as they are higher in histamine, leftover cooked veggies seem to take longer for that to happen. You should be okay to eat them for a few days.\n\n**PHASE TWO:**\n\nAdd in gradually:\n\n* **Coconut Oil** (Good, but ghee is probably better. Use sparingly.)\n* **Avocado Oil** works well too.\n* **Fresh-frozen lamb** (I recommend **Wild Fork’s lamb stew meat** from their website) For this one, start with one small chunk, and the next day try two and so forth. I can still only eat like 6 or 7 pieces a day but it's a LOT better than nothing. **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Broccoli, cauliflower, red cabbage, and Brussels sprouts** (These never bothered me, but they do have sulfur so don't overdo it.)\n* **Lesser Evil Brand Paleo Puffs** (straight Himalayan Pink Salt variety made with cassava (THIS ONE IS INCREDIBLE!)\n\nFor salads:\n\n* **Arugula, fresh herbs** (rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, tarragon, etc), olive oil, and a blend of blueberries, blackberries, and pomegranate juice. **(Be very moderate with the berries and pom. Don't eat more than a few berries a day. I made the mistake of starting to eat entire cartons of them and had reactions).** Also, as you cut your vegetables, combine some of each in tupperware and put this mix on your salad. That way, you are also getting some of the uncooked versions with their microbes into your gut. \n* **About pomegranate juice** \\- Pomegranate juice serves as a substitute for vinegar and salad dressing, ESPECIALLY when combined with the berries. Use POM Wonderful. Just make sure it's JUST the straight pomegranate juice version, not a mixture of two juices. You can also make pickles this way. Pomegranate juice with a lot of salt, and a small amount of **fresh** dill *(warning, this may be a liberator so you might want to forego the dill for a while!)* Soak sliced cucumber in it overnight in the fridge. But here's a **WARNING: buy the smallest container of the juice and use it within just a few days. If you get a big one and let it sit for weeks at a time, it will grow histamine. Also, don't overdo the pom juice. And monitor your body for reactions to it.**\n\n**PHASE THREE:**\n\n* **Jackson’s avocado oil (or coconut oil) Sweet Potato Chips (wavy is way better)** (mix with the calcium to handle oxalates). The sweet potato chips are great, but don't overdo them. And yes, even though avocados are an issue, the oil is fine. This stuff is all on Amazon (hopefully.)\n* **Apples (peeled)** (don't eat more than one a day because of sugar content)\n* These snacks will save you from going insane!\n\n**PHASE FOUR:**\n\n* **Fresh frozen chicken** (I buy the Wild Fork cubes from their website) This one I can eat less of than the lamb. Two cubes a day tops for me. Again, **MEAT MUST BE FRESH-FROZEN, NEVER THAWED, NOT FROM THE GROCERY STORE. AND NO LEFTOVERS ON MEAT. If it's thawed, it will grow histamine.**\n* **Brown rice-based gluten free pasta** (Hooray!)\n* **Sweet potatoes** (PEELED. NEVER eat the peel, and combine with calcium to break down oxalates)\n* **Carrot**\n* **Unsweetened, natural, dried coconut chips**\n\n**BAKING:**\n\nAt some point, you should be able to go to the store and buy **GLUTEN FREE BREAD,** the bread that has the least iffy ingredients. Let's see what I'm eating currently.\n\n\"Canyon Bakehouse Gluten Free Country White.\"\n\nIngredients: Water, brown rice flour, tapioca, whole grain sorghum flour, cane sugar, potato starch, whole grain oat flour, expeller pressed canola oil, xanthan gum, and 2 percent or less of egg whites, yeast, sea salt, vinegar.\n\nNow this has some stuff that if you are really struggling might be too much. Eggs and yeast and vinegar. But they are in such small amounts here. I'm tolerating eating two slices quite well currently. I use them to make a **sandwich.** Ghee on toast with rice noodles, lamb and chicken, vegetables like zucchini, arugula, and sesame oil. DELICIOUS!\n\nBut if you CAN'T tolerate this, you'll need to make your own bread.\n\nTo make **BREAD,** you will need these things:\n\n* **Cassava Flour**\n* **White Rice Flour**\n* **Arrowroot Flour**\n* **Sorghum Flour**\n* **Potato Starch**\n\nTell ChatGPT your situation, tell it you have these ingredients and ask for a safe recipe using them.\n\n**PHASE FIVE:**\n\nFor starters, up the **DIGESTIVE ENZYMES WITH BETAINE HCL.** Slowly try to get to where you are taking two with **EVERY MEAL.** Back off if you get nauseous.  \nThen, start trying these things:\n\n* **Egg yolk** (1 to start).\n* **Cinnamon** (seems to be fine)\n* And if you simply must have dessert beyond an apple, try making **rice pudding,** but instead of using regular sugar, always use **monk fruit sweetener with allulose.**\n* And for something with more weight, try **tempura veggies** using rice flour, potato starch, egg yolk and cooked in corn oil. So far, this one hasn't bothered me, but I probably wouldn't do it every day.\n* Small amounts of **garlic, pepper, onion powder.**\n* **Cauliflower Soup**\n* **Pistachios**\n* **Macadamia Nuts**\n* **Turkish Macadamia Butter**\n* **Unsulphured Dried Mangos**\n* **Occasional A2 Milk** (drink a small amount with the sweet potato chips to break down oxalates)\n* **Occasional organic grass-fed butter**.\n* **Rice Chex and regular Cheerios** (These have a small amount of things like molasses that may be triggering so don't overdo it)\n* **Sesame Oil** (Hooray!)\n* **One single corn tortilla** (preferably the rare, refrigerated kind that doesn't have a bunch of other weird ingredients, but any corn one might be okay.) You can use this to put rice, veggies, some sesame oil, arugula, and meat into to make a **taco.** \n* **Start microdosing.** A Pringle. A bite of casserole. Just one per day, and no not one bite of something you know it going to definitely mess you up like tomatoes or spinach. This may or may not be worth it.\n* When you are having a meal with a more advanced thing like dairy or corn or the meat, that's the meal that you should use the most Digestive Enzymes Ultra with Betaine HCl on.\n\nAt this point, you might hit kind of a wall where your histamine bucket overflows. You'll have to really work with ChatGPT and figure out which of the things you recently added is doing it. You might have to slow down or backtrack. It's also why you want to add each one of these gradually, one at a time. Don't have multiple question marks happening at the same time. Just one. Try one, wait several days, then try another. Same thing with supplements. **Do NOT add more than one thing at a time.**\n\nAt this point, I would recommend something that might sound strange.\n\n**Stop taking most of your supplements.** Not the DAO and not the Digestive Enzymes, but everything else. For a week. See how your body likes it. And from then on experiment with taking time off from them. A week, a month, and then back.\n\nIf you have gotten this far, try **vitamin B6 in the form of P-5-P,** although this one might cause reactions. See if you can get one that isn't like \"20 thousand percent daily value,\" but much lower. And for **vitamin b12**, try methylcobalamin.\n\nThis process took me at least six months, but it was worth it. I went from barely eating anything to now having enough variety in my diet that I'm no longer going insane. But the most important thing is that I’m **sleeping through the night again.** The scariest part of this disease is when it starts to look like you'll never be able to sleep again.\n\nDrink **LOTS of water** throughout the day to rid the body of histamine via urination.\n\nEat slowly and chew your food well!\n\nGet lots of sleep. And if you're REALLY struggling, don't exercise much, as it releases histamine. When you start healing, then start adding in exercise.\n\nAnother thing I’d recommend is to ditch any perfumes, colognes, incense and such or at least pay attention to them as they might be liberators. \n\nI CANNOT STRESS THIS NEXT ONE ENOUGH: If you are having serious skin issues like itching, **TAKE A SHOWER RIGHT BEFORE BED!** (not just in the morning, also not too hot) and then put lotion all over yourself immediately when you get out. This helps a lot.\n\nIf your scalp burns and itches, use **Jamaican Mango and Lime No More Itch Gro Spray (mentholated).** Soak it in the stuff and if it's really bad, put a shower cap over that and keep it on in bed. I used to have to sleep that way, but it saved my life. The stuff really helps a lot.\n\nMy hands were really bad too at night. **Cortisone cream** for this one. And try adding **Sarna** to it too. If your scalp is too much for even the spray, put this stuff on your head as well. Maybe everywhere. If all else fails, for itching, use cortisone cream.\n\n# Leaky Gut\n\nAlso, I think one of the most important things I did on my road to healing, and I also can't stress this enough, was watch the documentary **“Hack Your Health: Secrets to Your Gut”** on Netflix. I found that it really helped me understand how this all works, why I developed this disease in the first place, and what to do about it. Understanding more about the gut micro biome is extremely important to healing. Please, for the love of God, watch that one.\n\n# One Last Piece of Advice\n\nIt’s scientifically proven that trauma and stress are literally stored in the body and can manifest as physical diseases, especially autoimmune disorders and gut issues. If you have trauma, it's time to deal with it. Go to therapy. Meditate. Try reiki. Work with a shaman. Listen to solar plexus chakra healing frequencies on YouTube. Study PTSD. Read **The Body Keeps the Score** by Bessel van der Kolk. That one brings it all into crystal clear focus.\n\nI have CPTSD. I wasn’t facing it. I thought if I could just ignore it, I would be okay. But it doesn't work like that. When I reached my lowest point with the histamine disease, it became clear that I had to start healing emotionally in order to heal physically. The moment I began addressing my trauma, my histamine disease started to improve. I think this is a huge part of understanding how to heal from this illness.\n\nTake care of your gut. Address your mental health. Use ChatGPT. And don’t give up.\n\nAlso, if you have any suggestions about how I could personally go further in my own healing or make this better, please let me know.\n\nGood luck to all of you on this journey. You’re not alone.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea.

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

The sugar satiates the craving for sugar, since it is a hot drink you end up drinking it slowly so it takes care of my craving for a “dessert”, and it truly is a wonderful taste. \n\nIt takes a bit getting used to- and what I mean is the smell tells your brain “hot chocolate”, but it isn’t. And when you first taste it, because your brain is expecting something else that you already know, it can be “weird.” Again, the texture is the same as coffee. There are no artificial thickeners put in it like we are used to having with hot chocolate. So it takes a couple of tries to simply retrain your brain to accept something “new”.

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above. Heavy feeling on the skin.\n\n**Ingredient List :**  [Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Beeswax (Cera Alba)](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cera-alba), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Glycyrrhetinic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycyrrhetinic-acid), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Palmitic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/palmitic-acid), [Stearic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/stearic-acid), [Sorbitan Sesquioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-sesquioleate),[Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Mannitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol), [Xylitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract), 🌟[**Allantoin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)**, 🌟** [**Sodium Pca**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-pca), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol),[1,2-Hexanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/1-2-hexanediol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Triethanolamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/triethanolamine)\n\n**Fragrance:**  Yes. A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.  Pictured above. Feels heavy for a lotion.\n\n**Ingredient List :**[Aqua/​Water/​Eau](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Fructooligosaccharides](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/fructooligosaccharides), 🌟[**Zinc Oxide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-oxide)**,** [Sorbitan Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-stearate), [PEG-30 Dipolyhydroxystearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-30-dipolyhydroxystearate), [Butylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butylene-glycol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Copper Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/copper-sulfate), 🌟 [**Mannitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/mannitol)**,** [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), 🌟 [**Xylitol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/xylitol)**,** [Zinc Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-sulfate), [Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Vine Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/vitis-vinifera-vine-extract), [Rhamnose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/rhamnose),[Laureth-3](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-3), 🌟[**Asiaticoside**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiaticoside)**, 🌟**[**Madecassic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/madecassic-acid)**, 🌟** [**Asiatic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/asiatic-acid), [Hydroxyethylcellulose](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethylcellulose), [Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylic-capric-triglyceride), [Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laminaria-ochroleuca-extract)\n\n**Fragrance:** A subtler version of that greasy smell, a teeny bit herbal, to be this dissipates the quickest of all the bioderma moisturisers.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  😍 I love it. I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

I decided to indulge and bake them to refresh for Mother’s Day brunch.\n\nAs the flour mix listed is just white rice flour, tapioca starch and xanthan gum, I was somewhat skeptical.\n\nThe verdict from both the celiac and non celiac sides of the household is ‘quite good!’  They are very buttery and well laminated.  Not as crisp inside as perhaps the would be without having been frozen.\n\nThe photos show them just after 9 minutes in the oven.  I sliced one to show the lamination.\n\nDefinitely, a bit different from the L’Artisan Délices GF dairy free ones we typically get.  \n\nThe family is now asking to get the Chocolatines (aka chocolate croissants) from Le Marquis so we can do a comparison.\n\nNever imagined when we moved to an exclusively GF household 25 years ago to accommodate my spouse that we would have these options.\n\nI will drop the link for Le Marquis in the Comments since it’s not possible to have both links and photos in the same post.",
