    "body": "Over the years, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the hair care advice I've come across. Things never seem to work the way they're supposed to, and people seem to exclusively rely on anecdotes and personal experiences when giving their recommendations, often repeating things they read in a beauty mag or blog where the main goal is often to sell hair product or push dogma.\n\nSo I've done some digging, to learn a little bit about the real chemistry and science behind your hair care products, to dispel some myths and get to the truth of what's going on with your hair.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458934/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19467087\n\n#What is hair?\n\n>*Hair is an integrated system with a peculiar chemical and physical behavior. It is a complex structure of several morphological components that act as a unit. The hair shaft of mammals is divided into three main regions: Cuticle, cortex and medulla. The medulla is present in corser hair like grey hair, thick hair and beard hair, and it is absent in fine hair of children. There is more medulla in the coarser hair of Asians than Caucasians. The medulla may be involved in the splitting of hairs since it provides an area of weakness as a pathway for the propagation of cracks along the axis of the fiber.*\n\n>*The cuticle is a chemically resistant region and consists of flap overlapping scales (keratinocytes) like shingles on the roof. The shape and orientation of the cuticle cells are responsible for the differential friction effect in hair. The cuticle is generally formed by 6–8 scales thick for Asians, slightly less in Caucasians and even less in African hair. A thinner cuticle layer makes African hair more prone to breakage.*\n\n[Image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1083/7638/files/Hair-Anatomy-e1421050694589.png?v=1505924657)\n\n\n#Why do we shampoo? Is it necessary?\n\nOver time, your hair will develop a build up of dirt and other pollutants (eg: campfire smoke, minerals from hard water) as well as sebum, sweat and dead/peeled skin.\n\nPrior to the 1930's we simply used bar soap to wash our hair. The issue with this is that it would often leave a residue/soap scum on the scalp and hair, which is uncomfortable and aesthetically unpleasing. Shampoo was the answer.\n\nIn recent years, you may have heard that you don't need to shampoo, and that it causes your hair to produce more oils. This is untrue- there is no evidence to support the claim that using shampoo stimulates production of sebum on the scalp, including shampoos that contain sulfates and silicons.\n\nMost proponents of no-poo substitute shampoo with an alternative such as ACV or a specially formulated conditioner that effectively serves the same purpose.\n\n#How does shampoo work?\n\nThe main active ingredient in shampoo is a type of molecule called a surfacant. This is typically a sulfate, with the most common being Sodium Laureth Sulfate and Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. You may have heard that all sulfates do is \"create suds\" and damage your hair, this is incorrect.\n\n>*Residues are nonsoluble fats (sebum) that do not dissolve with water. In order to be removed from the hair shaft, surfactants present a hydrophobic molecular portion, and another hydrophilic. The former will chemically bond with the fat, while the latter will bond with the water. The surfactants are generally composed of a chain of fatty hydrocarbons (tail) and a polar head. The polar extremity is capable of giving this portion of the molecule hydrophilic traits that allow it to dissolve in water and wash away the residues.* \n\nWhat this basically means is that one end of the surfacant will attract water, and the other will repel it and attract sebum, allowing it to be washed out of the hair along with the shampoo.\n\nSurfacants can be classified into four groups: Anionic, cationic, amphoteric and nonionic.\n\n[Here's a classifications chart of common surfacants.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/bin/IJT-7-2-g001.jpg) \n\n* **Anionic detergents:** Among the most popular surfactants, they are named for their negatively charged hydrophilic polar group. Derived from fatty alcohols, they are very good at removing sebum from the scalp and hair. However, the excessively cleaned hair is harsh, rough, dull with frizz and prone to tangling. Among them, different classes of detergents are available with certain selective properties.\n 1. **Lauryl sulfates:** Popular primary cleansers, they work well in both hard and soft water, produce rich foam, and are easily rinsed. They are excellent cleansers, commonly used in shampoos for oily hair. As the hair becomes harsh and rough, careful selection of a secondary detergent and possible use of a conditioning agent is always required as part of the shampoo formulation. Examples of this class include: Sodium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and ammonium lauryl sulfate\n 2. **Laureth sulfates:** These are another class of excellent detergents with good cleansing ability and foaming property which are useful for normal-to-dry hair. Examples of this chemical class are: Sodium laureth sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate\n 3. **Sarcosines:** They are generally secondary detergents, as they do not remove sebum well from the hair to justify as primary cleansers. They are listed as the second or third on ingredient list of detergents. Excellent conditioners are used in conditioning shampoos and dry hair shampoos. Examples are: Lauryl sarcosine and sodium lauryl sarcosinate\n 4. **Sulfosuccinates:** These are strong detergents commonly used as a secondary surfactant in oily hair shampoos. Examples are disodium oleaminesulfosuccinate and sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.\n\n* **Cationic Detergents:** In contrast to anionic detergents they have a positively charged polar group. They are poor cleansers and do not lather well and are not compatible with anionic detergents, limiting their utility. However, they are excellent at imparting softness and manageability to chemically damaged hair and so are primarily used as daily shampoo for damaged hair such as in case of permanently dyed or chemically bleached hair. Examples are: Long-chain amino esters, ammonioesters, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.\n\n* **Amphoteric Detergents:** Having both positively and negatively charged polar group, they behave differently at lower pH (as cationic detergent) and at higher pH (as anionic detergent). Subgroups include the betaines, sultaines, and imidazolinium derivatives. They are used in baby shampoo and for those with fine and damaged hair because they don’t cause stinging in the eyes in children, foam well and leave hair in manageable state. Examples are: Cocamidopropyl betaine and sodium lauraminopropionate.\n\n* **Nonionic Detergents:** They have no polar group and are among the mildest of all cleansers and aid to improve the antistatic qualities of a shampoo. They can be combined with ionic detergent as a secondary cleanser. Examples are: Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters and alkanolamides.\n\nAll shampoos contain some variation or combination of these substances to wash your hair. Some sulfate-free shampoos may contain none, but this means that they are basically not effectively cleansing your hair. (most sulfate free shampoos will simply use a surfacant that doesn't contain the word \"sulfate\", though)\n\nHigh end shampoos from salons contain these same ingredients, with the main difference being perhaps nicer smells and a much stronger concentration that requires dilution in water before use.\n\n#####How often should I shampoo?\n\nYou probably do not need to shampoo every day, and you do not need to go weeks without shampooing. Shampoo your hair when it is oily or dirty. Experiment with different shampoos and take a look at the active chemicals that are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n#The benefit of conditioner\n\nModern shampoos are extremely effective. Unfortunately, heavily cleansed hair is not desirable to most, as it is harsh, hard to manage, prone to tangling, and looks dull.\n\nThe solution to this is a conditioner, which are sometimes included in the shampoo itself. \n\nA conditioner is any substance which is intended to enhance feel, appearance, fullness, lubricity, shine, and general manageability of hair. \n\n>*Conditioner molecules contain cationic surfactant which gives a positive electric charge to the conditioner. The negative charge of the hair is attracted to the positively charged conditioner molecules, which results in conditioner getting deposited on the hair, especially on areas where there is degree of weathering. This is true for damaged hair as they are even more negatively charged. Thus, conditioners reduce the static electricity. They also flatten the cuticle scales over the hair shaft, reducing the friction between hair fibers, increasing the reflectance of light which improves shine and color. The smooth feel resulting from conditioner use gives easier combing and detangling in both wet and dry conditions. Conditioners temporarily seal split ends and mend trichoptilosis.*\n\nConditioners will contain a wide variety of ingredients:\n\n* **Cationic surfactants:** Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, behentrimonium or propyltrimonium, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine. They are considered the backbone of a conditioner\nPolymers: Mono and polypeptides like hydrolyzed proteins (amino acids), polypeptides derived from collagen and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)\n\n* **Bodying agents and thickeners:** Fatty alcohols (e.g. cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), waxes (e.g. carnauba wax and paraffin wax), or gums (e.g. guar gum) and salt (sodium chloride)\n\n* **Emollients/oily compounds:** These include natural or synthetic oils, but also esters and waxes. Natural oils used in conditioners are, for example, jojoba oil, olive oil, or grape seed oil. The most frequently used synthetic oils are silicone (e.g. dimethicone, dimethiconol, amodimethicone and cyclomethicone) which are even superior to natural oils in terms of film formation, shine and luster. Asian countries have large hair diameters, therefore a higher concentration of silicone is used as compared to that for Caucasian hair (3-5% vs 0.5%)[1]\n\n* **Auxiliary emulsifiers:** Ethoxylated fatty alcohols (e.g. polysorbate-80 or ceteareth-20) which are non-ionic agents seem to be particularly effective at providing emulsion stability if it cannot be acheived by catiionic agents alone in a conditioner.\n\nThe big bogeyman you may notice is silicons. It is not bad for your hair, and not all silicons are equal. If you use a good shampoo with a good surfacant, build-up is not a concern and you likely don't need to worry too much about this. The backlash against silicons cropped up when people decided to eschew sulfates in their shampoo. Many people quickly realized that without proper cleansing, some silicons would build up in the hair over time.\n\nLike all things related to hair care, the key is balance. A fairly comprehensive resource for different types of silicons and how they behave is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) on /r/HairCareScience*, keep this in mind when deciding on which hair product to purchase for your hair.\n\n*while /r/HairCareScience has some good information on it and the moderators know their stuff, be wary of basically every comment from the users, as most of them are simply giving others anecdotal advice and spreading bogeymen.\n\n#How to wash and condition your hair.\n\nThe way you apply these products to your hair is undervalued, and doing it properly may have more benefit than you might suspect.\n\nShampoo should be applied starting from the front and working your way to the back. Applying it directly to the top of the head will create friction and cause tangling. \n\nOnce the shampoo has been rinsed from your hair, it's recommended to gently towel dry your hair before applying the conditioner. Conditioner should be applied on the length of the hair, avoiding the scalp.\n\nLeaving conditioner in your hair is not necessary, once the product has been spread over the surface of your hair it has done its job and may be rinsed out completely.\n\nAfterwards the hair may be gently towel dried. \n\n(If your hair is curly, there may be extra steps such as applying a leave-in product while hair is still wet. Using such products on straight thin hair may result in it looking oily and dull.)\n\n#TL;DR?\n\n* Wash your hair when it's dirty/oily. \n\n* There is no evidence to support the claim that sulfates stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil than normal.\n\n* Sulfates are not bad for your hair, but may cause it to look dry and become hard to manage. \n\n* Use conditioner or use a less effective surfacant to combat the above problem.\n\n* Silicons are not bad for your hair, most good shampoos will prevent any build up from happening.\n\n* The key to good hair care is not going \"no poo\" or \"sulfate/silicon free\", it's finding the right balance of chemicals to wash your hair and keep it looking good. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I believe your statement to be true that sulfates themselves wont stimulate the sebaceous glands to produce more oil. However, washing your hair too often will substantially raise the rate at which your scalp produces oil and thus the rate at which your hair gets greasy. There are two main reasons for this. The first reason is that when you wash your hair and scalp, you'll also inevitably stimulate the skin in that area, creating friction which results in more blood flow that will make the sebaceous glands \"work better\". The second reason is that by washing your hair you'll also remove the oil from your scalp. Leaving your skin in a dry condition. Dry skin will make your sebaceous glands work overtime to fix exactly that problem, as their main function is to lubricate and waterproof your skin. \n\nTldr: Don't wash your hair too often, it will get your hair greasy fast. It can also cause dandruff in the long term by overstimulating the sebaceous glands.\n\nSource: Studied hairdressing and am a barber.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove.

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml.

Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture.

According to their description it's silicone free. So I called to inquire as they confirmed this. I went to the store, purchased this item and had been using it for about 3 weeks. \n\nIn that time I had developed this aweful residue spot on the back if my head and couldnt figure it out. Finally I looked at the ingredient list and clear as day it lists Dimethicone. Now this caused me a little frustration but I thought I would call and complain.\n\nhere is the list of ingredients : Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Glutamic Acid, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n\nThen started the most ridiculous conversation with the Pantene product support people I have ever had.\n\nIn a nut shell, They insisted I use a shampoo, wanted to send me a pamphlet on how to properly use their product and when I was willing to overlook the fact that I'm not an idiot and was explaining that the issue was now how I was using it but that they mis-advertized their products, and said it was silicone free. The stupid lady tried telling me that DIMETHICONE is NOT silicone. \n\nSo that's when I realized that my perceptions of Pantene as a brand where not what I thought and they in fact don't know what they are talking about and as a result I will no longer trust them with being a quality product if they don't understand their own ingredients.\n\nBreath....end vent..\n\nwas I wrong? Because I was 95% sure Dimethicone is a silicone based polymer. Its in fact one of the most obvious silicone products.\n\nI might call back when i have calmed down and approach it as an allergy issue because they clearly are misrepresenting the product as far as I can tell and as soon as they find I don't use shampoo they don't seem to care.",

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

This advanced, silicone-free conditioner, with sea kelp extract, moisturizes your hair without weighing it down. Lightweight conditioning molecules leave hair moisturized and full of softness and body. The second essential step in achieving your Perfectly (Un)Done wavy look.\n\nMade in USA\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nWater (Aqua) , Cetearyl Alcohol , Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine , Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract (Kelp) , Behentrimonium Chloride , Fragrance , Dipropylene Glycol , Lactic Acid , Potassium Chloride , Disodium EDTA , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone\n\n**Price**\n\n$5.79 fo 25 fl. oz. \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nI got mine at Walgreens. I know this is a new conditioner, so it may be hard to find for a while. I would imagine it's going to be in every other store that carries Tresemme soon. :)\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\n(from the bottle)\n\n* Start with TRESemme Perfectly (Un)Done shampoo\n* Apply mid-lengths to ends\n* Run a wide-tooth comb or fingers from roots to tips to detangle and work into hair\n* Leave on for 2-3 minutes\n* Rinse thoroughly\n* Style with Perfectly (Un)Done styling products\n\n**Pros**\n\nGREAT slip, so perfect for detangling.  It smells nice too(I prefer this scent to the Naturals conditioner scent).  My hair felt soft after rinsing.\n\n**Cons**\n\nAs a leave-in, it was too watery. When I scrunched, it seemed to ALL come out. I don't even know how to describe it! I would add more conditioner, same thing. I would try to get most of the wetness out of my hair before adding the conditioner, same thing. \n\n**Overall**\n\nAs a rinse out- fabulous. Would definitely use again.\n\nAs a leave-in, I'll pass and go back to my TN Radiant Volume conditioner.  Sad... I really wanted this to work as a LI since the Radiant Volume conditioner is so hard to find.\n\nNOTE: I have read reviews on Naturallycurly.com where ladies LOVED this as their leave-in.  It was just too light for me. I need a thicker consistency to keep my thin curls clumped together.  ",

    "body": "A while back, I really wanted to simplify my haircare routine and tried cowashing, but didn't have much success with it. I read every how-to guide, tried a ton of different conditioners, and just eventually decided maybe it wasn't for me.\n\nFast forward to last weekend- I went out of town and just threw a couple of random shampoo and conditioner samples I had on hand into my bag. One of them was a [Sachajuan Hair Cleansing Cream](https://shop.sachajuan.com/products/hair-cleansing-cream)\n\nI got to the hotel, realized it wasn't a shampoo and decided to give it a shot according to the package directions. I had low expectations, but it was AMAZING. My hair looked great air dried with no product, and the wash lasted with just a little dry shampoo for a solid week.\n\nI looked into buying a bottle and it is really outside my budget. I am willing to pay for good quality hair products, and I can technically afford it, but we're trying to save up right now, so I'm hoping there is something close, even if not an exact dupe, available for less $$.\n\nThe ingredients are: AQUA (WATER),GLYCERIN, ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE,GLYCERYL STEARATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), HYDROLYZED RHODOPHYCEA (RED ALGAE) EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LINALOOL, LIMONENE.\n\nI've searched the sub and read a lot about what different ingredients do, but I'm not sure what's most important here?\n\nSo my question: am I just looking for something with glycerin high up on the ingredients list? Is there some combination of these ingredients that's most important? Or should I just suck it up and buy the real thing?\n\nIf it matters, I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be oily. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition. You can also check out my post on [Hygral Fatigue](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hygral-fatigue.html) to learn more about maintaining balance between moisture and protein in your hair. ",

    "body": "Hi, all!\n\nI recently switched shampoos and am now experiencing mild breakouts on my back and around my hairline.\n\nPrior to the switch, I was using Herbal Essence's Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner. While using this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair seemed dry, frizzy, and fragile. However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

    "body": "I'm looking for some advice on making my own shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI have eczema, which is worsened by fragrances. I've eliminated them in everything else, but I can't seem to find decent fragrance free hair products. Everything that works for my hair has fragrance and leaves my skin dry and itchy. Everything that's fragrance free leaves my hair dry and/or tangled.\n\nMy hair is long, brown, naturally straight, normal to dry, and a little thin, although I have a lot of hair. I wash and condition every other day, unless I'm physically active. I wrap my hair in a towel after showering to absorb excess water and let it air dry. I don't use any styling products.\n\nI'm thinking about making bars because I live in the USA and can't fit a week's worth of shampoo and conditioner in a 3 oz bottle. And, I really don't see the point in mixing it with water when I already shower with lots of water. It seems to me that it makes sense to just use a smaller amount of a concentrated product and use the water from my shower to dilute it.\n\nFor conditioner this is what I was thinking:\n\n-Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n-Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n\n-Glycerin\n\n-Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n\n-Some sort of oil (palm or olive, maybe) or shea butter\n\nI figured I would melt the solids, combine the ingredients and allow them to re-harden in a mold. That's as far as I've gotten. Thoughts on these ingredients? Best way to combine them? How do I ensure I have the proper PH? Has anyone made their own shampoo and/or conditioner before? How successful was it? Thoughts on bars vs liquid? Does anyone use a fragrance free product they really like?",

        "body": "I would strongly recommend against doing this. Unless you know the proper ratios and adjust the pH to the correct level you're actually asking for more irritation and the conditioning won't work either. Conditioners while simple are colloidal suspensions and are properly buffered and with specific ingredients at levels low enough as to not damage your eyes and not build up on the hair. Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine needs to be buffered in the system. The organic quats you have here are both water soluble not oils even though they appear to be waxy. The bar would likely be mush there are plenty of fragrance free natural conditioners on the market with low irritation profiles.",

I want to minimise the use of excessive chemicals so I've tried to pick products without SLS, parabens, etc where possible. Please can you point out any products which have questionable/ bad ingredients so I can look for better options? As a newbie it has been hard to figure out the names for all of them so I may have missed some! Be as critical as you can :) For example even if you think a product has excessive alcohol which may make it too drying compared to a similar product.\nThere are a few products here so even help on just one product would be much appreciated!

        "body": "The company is correct.  \n\nThe phtyokeratin (hydrolyzed wheat protein) and silk protein is sort of like a rope with magnets woven in.  The \"magnets\" are like a perfect \"key\" shape to fit into the perfect \"lock\" hole in your hair.  We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.  Put cement on the ropey bits.  It's going to fix in place.",

The use of \"...hydrolyzed protein which we fix with formaļdehyde\" suggests that during the treatment (heat?) of the hair, there is an equilibrium between HCHO-X-linked protein, and HCHO-X-linked keratin (hair). These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live. Really dangerous for hairdressers, and I wonder how much free formaldehyde is released during application?",

I feel like they are in literally EVERY single face or body cleanser, soap, and shampoo, and even some conditioners. Because despite being supposedly a common allergen and irritant, the whole sulfate free movement caused companies to jump to branding cocamidopropyl betaine as a gentle \"tear free\" cleanser/surfactant and now it's in everything. The only brand I know that avoids cocamidopropyl betaine altogether is Vanicream.\n\nIf anyone is also allergic or tends to avoid cocamidopropyl betaine, do you have any favorite products that don't contain it? They are just so hard to find. I end up just using things that contain it and then having to take five different types of antihistamines per day to control reactions, because it's in everything.",

This is my first post so please excuse any mistakes I may make. \n\nI'm looking for a deep conditioner for my curly and color-treated hair, and I think I may have found something. An Into the Gloss article I read strongly recommended the conditioning gloss that comes in Clairol's Nice 'N Easy dye kits, and I'm wondering if any of the ingredients raise any red flags?\n\nThe ingredients (from Clairol's website) are: WATER/EAU, BIS-HYDROXY/METHOXY\nAMODIMETHICONE, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL\nALCOHOL, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE,\nGLUTAMIC ACID, DICETYLDIMONIUM\nCHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE/PARFUM, BENZYL\nALCOHOL, CITRIC ACID, EDTA, HISTIDINE,\nSODIUM CHLORIDE, TRIMETHYLSILOXYSILICATE,\nMETHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE,\nMETHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE.\n\nThanks! Also, if this turns out not to be so great for my hair, could someone please recommend an alternative?",

I'm only able to use conditioner on the lengths of my hair but I need to avoid my scalp completely. It also doesn't have to be a preservative you're allergic too, it's pretty common that menthol, peppermint or coconut oil is causing this. I know several people to be allergic to coconut oil. You could consider patch testing for those if you haven't yet.\n\nObviously you should stop using this conditioner asap. It sounds pretty bad, and it can take a while to recover. It took me two months to recover from those 2 co-washes I've done. Especially because it's back at full force, that's a huge sign something is up.",

Cationic agents also help to condition, although differently (behentrimonium chloride is my favourite, but you'll see cetrimonium chloride and various polyquaterniums around).\n\nI have super sensitive skin, so I use a conditioner base designed for mixing with essential oils, then don't mix anything with it. I use [Melrose conditioner base](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f868246454.html). A short ingredient list is best!\n\nAs /u/Silverbleed said below, try to avoid piling the conditioner onto your scalp. Shifting grease down hair shafts should help with any sebum buildup, whether with fingers or a brush.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you 🙏🏻🖤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

        "body": "Yes, the ingredients matter but acids aren't really the issue. Oils and surfactants are the problem. Sulfate tends to be the most common problem ingredient. Also a hair mask won't really do much beyond a conditioner for a doll's hair as it's basically plastic and won't absorb things the way natural hair will. Your best bet is a cheap sulfate free conditioner mixed with a little fabric softener.",

I've always had pretty rubbish skin but I put it down to being lazy with my skincare routine / wearing liquid foundation / just being young.\n\n\nI'm 25 now, so thought I should shape up! About 6 months ago I started to take it seriously. I stopped wearing makeup on my face (just mascara and eyeliner now) and I ditched the makeup remover wipes. \n\n\nI started using a Clinique Acne Solutions kit I got in the USA on holiday and my skin got a bit better... Then the face wash ran out and I can't find the range at all in the UK. I got the Clinique Anti-Blemish Solutions instead but it seems to not have worked as my skin is really sore again.

        "body": "To me, this sounds like my rosacea. A lot of people have rosacea that just makes their skin look reddish/flushed but it's often still smooth - but for some (including myself) it manifests in cheek redness, little pustule like bumps that seem like zits, itchiness and/or soreness. If it is rosacea, all the acne treatments you are using on it are going to make it more irritated and noticeable. I would make an appt with a dermatologist for a diagnosis - if it is rosacea, there are topical prescriptions that can help. Although I will say that most of them only work for a little while and that it's important to learn your skin's own triggers and sensitivities in order to control it long term. There are even dietary changes that can make a difference.",

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.​ (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half, which is a life saver when you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a [Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.  The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it harder to grow and maintain your hair over time. \n\n**​Heat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Oréal](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx), their products are \"often formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:** found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer \n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation) \n* Polyquaternium-55 \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein \n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n​  \n**Oils and Silicones:** products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576°F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer \n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:** not found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?* ](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

A few weeks ago I used [Overtone Espresso](https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1gg42bd/before_and_after_espresso_overtone_conditioning/) and this week I used Aura Bold Sonoma red. I've been using these over henna for over two years and they don't seem to affect dye uptake when I eventually henna the roots, but I do clarify with a sulfate shampoo and do hard water treatment before doing henna. The Aura masque certainly added some color and does help the roots blend even if it doesn't fully cover grey. However, it dyes the scalp much worse than Overtone does and overall the color is a bit dull for my taste.

    "body": "So, to start things off: I have curly, low-porosity hair that's on the coarse side, and although I love my curls at times I've been really wanting to experiment with doing a silk press. Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

I typically scrub it into my scalp and let it sit. If your hair stops feeling *slick* with conditioner, you need to wash it out and repeat the process until it stops feeling slick. Once it stays slick, leave it in as you soap up and wash the rest of your body, or shave your face.\n\n\nI think you should find a cheaper conditioner with more alcohol and less oils.

I currently wash every other day at most, I try to go 3 days between washing my hair, using redken extreme moisture. My scalp gets super oily very quickly and my ends are dried and damaged.  My hair type is between a 1 and 2a, non porous, thin but dense. It is currently chest length but I will be cutting it to shoulder length this week.\nI was thinking of the Neutorgena Anti-Residue Shampoo as my clarifying shampoo. Loreal EverClean Cleaning Cleanser or DevaCurl No-Poo Conditioning Cleanser as a in between clarifying shampoo as needed. MY condition would be the Trader Joes Nourish Spa Conditioner OR the Mane and Tail Conditioner. I have previously used mane and tail and I loved it when I used it which is why I am leaning that way. Also I noticed there are parabens in both. (Mane and Tail Ingredients: Water, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine Lactate, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Stearyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax NF, Cetyl Alcohol, Coconut Oil, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Vegetable Oil, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Protein, Lanolin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, F D & C Yellow #5) I based using these off of mainly the co-washing guide and products recommendation.\n\nBasically does this sound like a good plan, are these good products? Are there better products? How bad do you think my adjustment period will be?",

None of my hair has ever been bleached, dyed, or chemically straightened, and I have used heat on it exactly once in the few years it's been since I shaved it all off. My scalp tends to be oily, and I get mild flakes which I've used T-Gel to combat for most of my life. \n\nMy current routine is a weekly shampoo with SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo, and daily/every-other day co-wash with either SE Strawberry or HE Freesia. Plop for 15-30 minutes (I get distracted), sometimes use some Raw Shea & Cupuaçu Frizz Defense Styling Gel-Cream when it's damp.\n\nI'm wondering what ingredients are different to make me enjoy using SE, and dislike using HE. I can't actually *see* any difference on the days I use one or the other (so I should probably use HE for a week or two and see if there's a visible difference) but the texture, slip, and feel of HE is much nicer in my hair. \n\nComparing the ingredients with the copy&paste website, SE has Propylene Glycol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol  as \"approved\".

There’s nothing in the ingredient list that served a formaldehyde-producing function.\n\nYou can absolutely thermally reshape keratinaceous materials like hair with just heat and moisture. It’s just that the effects are usually not as durable without formaldehyde. \n\nMany of the ingredients are surfactants, emulsifiers, and oils that likely help the reshaped hair resist ambient humidity.",

I have been doing deep conditioning treatments every other day with no protein or aloe vera for the past month, sometimes with heat because my hair is somewhat low porosity, and it feels more moisturized than it did, but it still does not pass the stretch test, the shine is absent and my waves which were previously [2A or 2B?](https://imgur.com/a/95z4Pj1) are now much straighter and mostly just frizzy. I have clarified with both sulfate and sulfate-free clarifying shampoos and have done three vinegar rinses. is there anything else I can do to get some of the protein out or do I just have to give it more time?\n\n----------------\n\nedit: I thought I would post an update for anyone happening to read this thread looking for information on protein overload. the products I had in my rotation had a lot of hidden protein. the stearamidopropyl dimethylamine as discussed in the comments was not a problem - [it is not a protein or amino acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/f1fcr6/id_dimethylamine_an_amino_acid/) but some other ingredients were. Biotin in the V05 I was using to clarify. Lots of extracts - mentha aquatica leaf extract, coconut extract, rose extract, clover extract, horsetail extract... The Mane n Tail detangler is full of them. Extracts don't always have large amounts of protein and if they do it's not always small enough to make it past the pores, but there's no way to know so it's best to avoid them. I was using a curl cream on occasion which has lysine hcl (an amino acid) and a hairspray that had aminomethyl propanol (why did \"aminomethyl\" not ring alarm bells for me....).\n\nI cut out all these products and after a week my hair was back to being properly wavy. There was some other stuff that happened after that with a haircut though, suffice to say I am in protein overload again because I am a doormat and let my hairdresser do a keratin treatment and give me a blowout. I also realized my hair was high porosity, not lowish, and I am giving it the proper sequence of penetrating oils and sealing oils it needs, which is really helping with the shine and hydration.",

Back then I didn't think it helped much with my hair, but I was also using some shampoos and conditioner with protein (and cones)\n\nAs of now I'm using Aubreys Honeysuckle rose conditioner or something, the protein free one. It's not super, but it's alright. I'm willing to use the whole bottle and maybe buy again.\n\nI am also currently using Kinky Curly Knot today, but to be honest it does little to nothing for my hair. If I use just a bit too much, my hair looks really weird and dirty, and it doesn't give any bounce to my hair.\n\nI've been using Head and shoulders the past three weeks as I think I might have Seborrheic dermatitis. The shampoo is drying my hair, but my scalp seems pretty satisfied (less sebum build up, no irritation, and my scalp is pretty sensitive to even good brands). I will not continue to use H&S, but maybe periodically if there seems to be a sebum issue again.\n\nIdeally I would not be using much shampoo. Maybe just ACV and baking soda rinse now and then.\n\nI'm waiting for a Giovanni shampoo bought on Iherb to bring out the colour of my blonde hair, which I will be using only now and then. (It's got cones, the one called amodimethicone (supposedly a \"good\" quality cone?)\n\nI'd prefer my hair would be cone free, and I will try to keep it fairly cone light atleast. I don't mind cones much, I just hate the build up on blonde hair and feeling like I rely on cones, haha. But mainly I want to stear clear from protein.\n\n\nMy hair is btw 2a/2b, mousey blonde during winters, thick and extremely coarse, and also very frizzy.\n\nThese are the ingredients in the KMS Tame Frizz creme. Can anyone tell me if there are any sort of proteins in it? I will try to only use a small amount of this just to see how my hair will respond now that I don't use the same shampoo/conditioner as I did last summer.\n\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetyl Acetate, VP/VA Copolymer, Isopropyl Myristate, Sorbitan Oleate, Lanolin Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Butyl Stearate, Lanolin Oil, Chitosan, Glycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Caryocar Brasiliense Fruit Oil, Acacia Seyal Gum Extract, Silicone Quaternium-22, Oleyl Acetate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Glycyl Glycine, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Acetamide MEA, Stearyl Acetate, Propylene Glycol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-11, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tetrasodium EDTA, PPG-3 Myristyl Ether, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance / Parfum.",

I have a really weird type of hair it's hard to explain but its messy all the time people always said my hair has multiple whorls so if it sticks up at 3 places.  tho i guess if i have to categorize in those 4 categories it would be just straight short hair.\nSo here is my dilema i wanna finally take the next step to cut off shampoo completely ,but i dont really have alot of money at the moment. so i wanted to ask would it be alright to use a cheap conditioner for now ? i think it has some bad stuff in it im gonna list ingredients at the end of the post but i really have no option for more expensive stuf and baking soda makes my hair feel dirty i don't know why:I. so should i just continue my rare shampoo using for now or cut it off completely for conditioner. Thanks you for the anwsers and inspiration to go nopoo.\n\n\nconditioner ingrediants:aqua,stearyl alchohol,cetyl alchohol,dimethicone,stearamidopropyl dimethylamine,hydrolyzed keratin,hydrolyzed silk,diamond poweder,guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride,Lactic acid,Coco betaine,cocamidopropyl betaine,sodium chloride,C12-15 pareth-3,phenoxyethanol,linalool,butylphenyl,methylpropional,limonene,alpha-somethyl lonone,parfum.",

The cornerstone of the line is [New Wash](http://www.shophairstory.com/www/product/869693000106), which is basically a fancy co-wash. I tried it and I love it (like, really love it). It does all the things it says it will and it made my hair lovely, but it's $40 for 8 oz and I went through that in about 4 washes. Since I can't afford to spend $10 every time I wash my hair, I was wondering if anyone could recommend a conditioner with similar ingredients that I could try. \n\n**New Wash ingredients:**\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Stearyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Gluconolactone, Rosa Centifolia Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Rosa Canina Seed Extract, Equisetum Hiemale Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Keratin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Menthyl Lactate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate.",

I've tried 5 different versions of my recipe, and all of them have separated, either after adding my cool-down ingredients (silicones, preservatives, amino acids), or I don't get emulsion in the first place!\n\n\nI thought it might be the preservative, but I have tried Optiphen Plus, Liquid Germall Plus, and a potassium sorbate/sodium benzoate combo in different batches with the same results. I have tried including the dimethicone in the oil phase. I have tried the SD in the oil phase (per my supplier), and in the water phase with the citric acid (per many other recipes)... I only get emulsification when it is in the water phase.\n\n\nI would be eternally grateful if someone with some experience formulating with SD could let me in on whatever secret/magic I need to get this to work!\n\n\nMy formula is approximately as follows:\n\nq.s. water\n\n3% stearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n0.2% citric acid\n\n\n6% cetearyl alcohol\n\n\n2% dimethicone\n\n2% cyclomethicone\n\n0.5-1.5% preservative, depending on which one I'm using\n\n\nedit: formatting",

    "body": "Hello /r/curlyhair. I'm looking for product recommendations.\n\nMy hair is a 2C/3A. I have a mix of fine and medium strands of hair. I have low porosity hair. It takes a while for my hair to get wet in the shower unless I have a product in my hair already.\n\n[Hair pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/6dVcaoc.jpg),\n[Hair pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/cPptB4N.jpg),\n[Hair strands pic](https://i.imgur.com/SBCjAIx.jpg),\n[Hair strands pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/ihXML89.jpg),\n[Overhead pic](https://i.imgur.com/QQUOtud.jpg)\n\nI'm having trouble finding products that work. I have tried the **[Tresemme Botanique Coconut Oil and Aloe Vera](https://smartlabel.labelinsight.com/product/4520604/ingredients)** and my hair felt 'rough' when I ran my hands through it. Kind of like the squeaky clean feeling. I've tried **[Aveda's Cherry Almond conditioner](https://m.aveda.com/product/5293/58931/hair-care/conditioner/cherry-almond-softening-conditioner#/shade/6.7_fl_oz%2F200_ml)** and had the same feeling. The same ingredients between these 2 conditioners is *Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine and Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*. \n\nI know that *Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine* is a water soluble silicone but I feel like this is the problem ingredient rather than the *Coconut Oil*.\n\nI have tried **[Pacifica Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Mask](https://www.pacificabeauty.com/products/pineapple-hydrate-curl-nourishing-mask)**. This also made my hair feel 'rough' and it also has *Coconut Oil* but it has a protein *Hydrolyzed Quinoa Protein* and *Rice Protein* in it and I think my hair is protein sensitive.\n\nI tried **[Alaffia Everyday Shea Conditioner](https://www.alaffia.com/products/shea-conditioner-lavender)** and it made my hair feel extra squeaky. The main ingredients to this conditioner are *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Leaf Aqueous Extract and Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*. Some other ingredients that I haven't had the chance to isolate in this product are *Emulsifying Wax and Lavadula Hybrida (Lavender Oil)*. I didn't expect to get a bad reaction from this but again, I never had the chance to experience *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Leaf Aqueous Extract*, the *Emulsifying Wax* or the *Lavender*. \n\nI tried **[Jessicurl's Deep Conditioning Treatment](https://www.jessicurl.com/product/deep-treatment)** and it also has made my hair feel that rough feeling. The ingredients this shares with the other conditioners are *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)* and *Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice Powder*.\n\nI have tried **[Pacifica Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Conditioner](https://www.ulta.com/pineapple-curls-curl-defining-conditioner?productId=xlsImpprod18971187)** it also feels bad on my hair but better than every other product. The only big common is ingredient is *Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*. Every other ingredient I'm not sure about.\n\nLast time I posted this, I was suggested **[Coconut & Hibiscus Curl & Shine Conditioner](https://www.sheamoisture.com/coconut-and-hibiscus-curl-and-shine-conditioner/764302290629.html)** and that also made my hair feel rough. It had protein *Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol*, which I don't think helped. And the common ingredients were *Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, and *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*. I also don't know if I should trust *Panthenol* or *Hydroxyethylcellulose*\n\nThe only product that seems to work on me is **[Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Detangler](https://shop.naturallycurly.com/kinky-curly-knot-today-8-oz/)**. While this does a great job to help style my hair and detangle it, when I wash it off, it feels rough. I assume because of the *Behentrimonium Methosulfate* which is considered a gentle cleanser.\n\nHere's what my hair looks like with **[Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Detangler](https://shop.naturallycurly.com/kinky-curly-knot-today-8-oz/)**, **[Pacifica Pineapple Swirl Curl Defining Cream](https://www.ulta.com/pineapple-swirl-curl-defining-cream?productId=pimprod2002207)**, and **[The Innate Life Rose Hair Elixir](https://theinnatelife.com/products/rose-hair-elixir)**.\n\n[Hair with product](https://i.imgur.com/4gqHGeH.jpg),\n[Hair with product 2](https://i.imgur.com/1kXlfmA.jpg),\n[Hair with product 3](https://i.imgur.com/DUOLG2j.jpg)\n\nThese pics are a day after having the products in my hair. And I know my pictures are hard to see but my curls look great. But after I wash it out, I have that squeaky/rough feel. I think the problem is *Behentrimonium Methosulfate*.\n\nI don't know what to buy anymore. Every product I look at has either silicones, humectants, or proteins. And I don't know if I should trust *shea butter/aloe vera/coconut oil* anymore. Can anyone suggest something without any of these things?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and please help.",

        "body": "I have your hair type and have been CG for 3 years.   I've tried HUNDREDS of products.  The best product line for low porosity, fine hair for me has been Giovanni Eco Chic line.50:50 is balanced (a little glycine soya in there which will NOT be too much protein for your hair......all hair needs a bit of protein, esp. fine hair, since fine hair needs \"structure\").  The Tea Tree has a ton of slip, your hair w/water and this in it the tangles will fall out in the shower, and no protein.  The Smooth as Silk is thicker, richer, and has both glycine soya and some hydrolized soy....I often mix it with my tea tree one.I also often mix the Smooth as Silk with their NutraFix for deep conditioning.....my hair is fine and super low porosity and enjoys the structure that some medium-molecule protein gives.\n\nFWIW, I would stay away from straight oils of any kind and also any oils and butters unless they are very well emulsified w/in  a product.  Any oil or butter that solidifies at room temperature (shea, coconut, babussu) will not work great on low porosity hair esp. if it is fine.......it will just sit on top of hair and weigh it down, make it dull.\n\nThe most common feature of low porosity hair is buildup.....it gets buildup very fast.  The reason is that lo po hair does not absorb products well, just like it doesn't absorb water well.  So you really have to squish in the right condishes and with a lot of water, while in the shower, to get stuff \"in there\".But it's also the healthiest hair because it does not lose moisture quickly, doesn't tend to tangle easily or get a lot of split ends.\n\nOther recommended products would be Mane Choice Peach Black Tea line.......the masque is zero protein but is lovely and the condish is very lightweight.  Also their 3-in-1 soft as can be condish is wonderful and does not weigh down my hair , despite having some castor oil in it (not an oil that solidifies,so maybe that is why it works)\n\nAnd believe it or not, most all of the Vo5 condishes work fantastic in low porosity fine hair....price doesn't indicate it's not as good as other stuff.   My hair loves it.  Also your KCKT is pretty good too, for most low porosity fine hair, although can be a bit greasy/heavy for some of them.  I owuld keep that one.\n\nIf you wnat to seal your hair after your styling product (mousse or gel, I use givoanni) you can put a drop or 2 of argan or grapeseed oil on your palm, rub together, and just SOTC with it........it will provide a barrier from humidity yet not be greasy.  Both of those are very lightweight.\n\nI hope this helps you.  I've been at this a long time.  I can't swear what works for me will work for you, but I've tried enough stuff to feel confident to at least make some suggestions for you.",

    "body": "Hello /r/curlyhair. I'm looking for product recommendations.\n\nMy hair is a 2C/3A. I have a mix of fine and medium strands of hair. I have low porosity hair. It takes a while for my hair to get wet in the shower unless I have a product in my hair already.\n\n[Hair pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/6dVcaoc.jpg),\n[Hair pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/cPptB4N.jpg),\n[Hair strands pic](https://i.imgur.com/SBCjAIx.jpg),\n[Hair strands pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/ihXML89.jpg),\n[Overhead pic](https://i.imgur.com/QQUOtud.jpg)\n\nI'm having trouble finding products that work. I have tried the **[Tresemme Botanique Coconut Oil and Aloe Vera](https://smartlabel.labelinsight.com/product/4520604/ingredients)** and my hair felt 'rough' when I ran my hands through it. Kind of like the squeaky clean feeling. I've tried **[Aveda's Cherry Almond conditioner](https://m.aveda.com/product/5293/58931/hair-care/conditioner/cherry-almond-softening-conditioner#/shade/6.7_fl_oz%2F200_ml)** and had the same feeling. The same ingredients between these 2 conditioners is *Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine and Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*. \n\nI know that *Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine* is a water soluble silicone but I feel like this is the problem ingredient rather than the *Coconut Oil*.\n\nI have tried **[Pacifica Pineapple Hydrate Curl Nourishing Mask](https://www.pacificabeauty.com/products/pineapple-hydrate-curl-nourishing-mask)**. This also made my hair feel 'rough' and it also has *Coconut Oil* but it has a protein *Hydrolyzed Quinoa Protein* and *Rice Protein* in it and I think my hair is protein sensitive.\n\nI tried **[Alaffia Everyday Shea Conditioner](https://www.alaffia.com/products/shea-conditioner-lavender)** and it made my hair feel extra squeaky. The main ingredients to this conditioner are *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Leaf Aqueous Extract and Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*. Some other ingredients that I haven't had the chance to isolate in this product are *Emulsifying Wax and Lavadula Hybrida (Lavender Oil)*. I didn't expect to get a bad reaction from this but again, I never had the chance to experience *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Leaf Aqueous Extract*, the *Emulsifying Wax* or the *Lavender*. \n\nI tried **[Jessicurl's Deep Conditioning Treatment](https://www.jessicurl.com/product/deep-treatment)** and it also has made my hair feel that rough feeling. The ingredients this shares with the other conditioners are *Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)* and *Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice Powder*.\n\nI have tried **[Pacifica Pineapple Curls Curl Defining Conditioner](https://www.ulta.com/pineapple-curls-curl-defining-conditioner?productId=xlsImpprod18971187)** it also feels bad on my hair but better than every other product. The only big common is ingredient is *Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*. Every other ingredient I'm not sure about.\n\nThe only product that seems to work on me is **[Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Detangler](https://shop.naturallycurly.com/kinky-curly-knot-today-8-oz/)**. While this does a great job to help style my hair and detangle it, when I wash it off, it feels rough. I assume because of the *Behentrimonium Methosulfate* which is considered a gentle cleanser.\n\nHere's what my hair looks like with **[Kinky-Curly Knot Today Leave In Detangler](https://shop.naturallycurly.com/kinky-curly-knot-today-8-oz/)**, **[Pacifica Pineapple Swirl Curl Defining Cream](https://www.ulta.com/pineapple-swirl-curl-defining-cream?productId=pimprod2002207)**, and **[The Innate Life Rose Hair Elixir](https://theinnatelife.com/products/rose-hair-elixir)**.\n\n[Hair with product](https://i.imgur.com/4gqHGeH.jpg),\n[Hair with product 2](https://i.imgur.com/1kXlfmA.jpg),\n[Hair with product 3](https://i.imgur.com/DUOLG2j.jpg)\n\nThese pics are a day after having the products in my hair. And I know my pictures are hard to see but my curls look great. But after I wash it out, I have that squeaky/rough feel. I think the problem is *Behentrimonium Methosulfate*.\n\nI don't know what to buy anymore. Every product I look at has either silicones, or proteins. And I don't know if I should trust *shea butter/aloe vera/coconut oil* anymore. Can anyone suggest something without any of these things?\n\nAlso, I've been avoiding *humectants* because it seems like the weather has to be perfect for it to work well. If I just use a regular conditioner/deep conditioner with a humectant and stay inside the house afterwards, what can I do to make it effective?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and please help.",

        "body": "Hopefully on of the folks with a science background can chime in because the little I know about SD is that it's not as easy to work with as regular btms 25/50.   I think it needs to be at pretty particular ph range and might be more fussy about what it's formulated with because it can just end up being ineffective if done incorrectly.  Where as btms is rather easy mode/forgiving for trying out random formulas on your own.  I have some in my supply stash but haven't had the time effort to get it work for me yet because life is just too busy.   Good luck to you.  I hope you get some proper advice on it.",

        "body": "I've used SD before in my conditioner and truthfully I consider it a secondary emulsifier rather than a primary one. Depending on how much BTMS and cetyl alcohol you use, SD can definitely give a smoother finish.\n\nIt doesn't build viscosity as effectively as BTMS becauseit isn't sold with as much cetyl alcohol as a diluent (I've used Conditioner SD from Making cosmetics). But it does a great job of boosting the conditioning feeling. \n\nYou might find your conditioner lacks the same build as adding in extra cetyl alcohol if you use it as a primary conditioner only. You might consider alternative aqueous thickening agents to make up for the lack of cetyl alcohol. \n\nIn a leave-in though, it might be better to have a slightly runnier formula anyway. I haven't tried making one yet, but my husband has been buying from Verb and I'm thinking about duping it now.",

        "body": "I work with this ingredient a lot. SD is fairly alkaline and needs to be neturlized to an acidic pH (\\~4-5) to work properly as both an emulsifier and conditioner. Different acids will have differing impacts on viscosity. Lactic acid will yield more viscosity than citric acid. Aspartic acid is preferred for viscosity if you can get your hands on it. \n\nWeigh out your water with your heat-tolerant water-soluble ingredients. Heat to \\~80C. Add your acidifier, mix until clear. Add SD and mix until clear. Then add your oil phase ingredients. At this point you will create an emulsion that will be hazy or opaque but may not have any viscosity. You should include 4-8% cetyl, stearyl, or cetearyl alcohol to stabilize the emulsion and provide conditioning and slip. Keep the oils and butters to a lower level for best performance. Add each oily ingredient individually while the batch ias still hot, mixing between each addition to ensure each item melts and incorporates while maintaining the temperature \\~80C. The product needs to be homogenous before cooling. Cool down with gentle mixing then add your heat-sensitive ingredients. Ensure end pH is \\~4-5. Product will separate if pH is too high. \n\nIt sounds tricky but once you get the hang of it you're golden. SD is not compatible with anionic ingredients like xanthan gum, hyaluronic acid, and some emulsifiers. I personally like it best when paired with BTAC.",

    "body": "Long time lurker on this sub. I had a solid haircare routine that was working for my fine straight hair thanks to all the amazing info here! I got a balayage highlight recently and added a serum to help manage the change in texture/dryness/frizziness I experienced after the color treatment. \n\nSpecifically, I added a smoothing serum into my normal co-wash routine have reached a point where I could use some feedback. \n\nHere's what I use and the ingredients: \n\n1. Daily co-wash with **Tresemme botanique nourish and replenish conditioner**: Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Behentrimonium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Potassium Chloride, Disodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone\n2. Daily (for the past week) **Eva NYC Get Glossed! serum**: Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-propyl Silanetriol (Keravis™), Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Oil, Perfume\n3. Weekly wash (roots only) with **Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Shampoo** (the old formula, transcribed by hand): water, coconut oil, shea butter, aloe vera leaf juice, argan oil, panthenol, rosemary extract, sea kelp extract, vitamin E, guar gum, honeysuckle flower extract, avocado oil\n4. Weekly deep condition with **Hask Monoi Coconut Oil Nourishing Deep Conditioner Packet**: Water / Eau (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Quaternium-18, Gardenia Tahitensis (Monoi) Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Myrtillus (Bilberry) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride, Isopropyl Palmitate, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Silk Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Fragrance / Parfum (Fragrancia)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy questions are: \n\n1. Can my current co-wash remove the silicones in the serum since they are not accompanied by cationic ingredients (as far as I can tell)? I was using [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) to evaluate the serum and I want to make sure I'm not missing something. \n2. If my co-wash cannot remove the silicones, and I've been using this for the past week, is there a way to remove them without stripping my recent color treatment?\n3. Thoughts on my overall moisture vs. protein balance? I am liking the way my hair looks and feels on this regimen. Should I be concerned adding in a daily serum with protein, on top of protein that is in my weekly deep condition?\n4. Any suggestions for a replacement for the Shea Moisture shampoo since they have reformulated (such a bummer!). This bottle is lasting me since I only wash once a week but I will need to replace this eventually. \n\nThank you in advance for your feedback!",

    "body": "Hi y'all! So I've been intrigued by the nopoo method for a while now and after talking to some of my online colleagues in the last few days, I've decided to give it a go! It's still mostly quarantine here in South Carolina/Georgia and I figured now would be as good a time as ever to give this a shot.\n\nI had washed my hair normally last Wednesday with the shampoo listed below. From what I understand I should not need a clarifying shampoo for that one but I could be wrong. Today I scritched and preened and brushed with a BBB brush, which made my hair go from fairly greasy to really gross looking, and then I showered and did a Water Only wash. I stood under the shower head with warm water and scritched and preened for at least twice as long as it usually takes me to wash my hair. Then I washed my body. And then I went back under the shower head and scritched and preened some more. My hair felt very oily to my fingers even after doing the water wash twice, but I resisted the urge to use the shampoo. I did use my regular bath towel to ruffle my hair so it wasn't soaking wet. I do intend to get a microfiber towel or maybe steal one of my husband's old tshirts... but I didn't have access to that today. As of right now, my hair is still wet so I am not sure if it still looks oily or not. I hope not. I will say again that it felt oily while in the shower, but it is feeling cleaner to the touch as it dries.\n\nMy goal is Water Only and I'm pretty much a cold turkey kind of person. I do have an important appointment the end of this week that I'll need to look presentable for, and I would like to look mostly clean for my in-laws when we visit on Saturdays. As my hair is short, it is difficult to pull it back if it gets bad. I can sort of pull back the top but only a bit. Also, I can't stand to wear a hat or really anything on my head beyond the occasional tiara... cause a girl needs a tiara every now and then, lol.\n\nI would gladly welcome any insights, warnings, anecdotes, encouragement, or words of wisdom any of y'all would like to toss my way. I am super new to this and want to be as prepared as I can be for this journey. I'm also very lazy when it comes to my hair so I know this is going to be a change for a while but I'm hoping it will be worth it.\n\nSo anyway, here's some information about my hair type, routine, and anything else I could think of to add in after reading through several posts on this page.\n\n**My Hair Type**: From the chart listed in the link on the sidebar I believe my hair type is \"2b: Wavy/Medium: Can tend to be frizzy and a little resistant to styling.\" The description for 2c also fits, but I don't have as much as a wave as indicated in the picture chart.  I have struggled with frizz all my life. It's gotten better since I moved to a more humid climate but when I go to my parent's in the desert the frizz comes back really bad. My hair is also very resistant to styling and will not hold a curl for more than an hour, even when I would use products as a teenager.\n\n**Porosity**: This one really confused me. I did the strand test where you feel the hair and it felt quite rough to me going from tip to root, which would mean high porosity. But then I did the water test and the strand never sank, which means low porosity. So I'm getting conflicting answers between the two different tests. I will say that my hair is coarse and holds onto water for a very long time. It takes hours to dry naturally. My hair is also very oily and always has been. My skin is oily as well. EDIT: After doing another test I'm going with Low Porosity. \n\n**Water**: According to my city's website and a map I found online my water is soft, but not very soft.\n\n**Protein**: I tested this today and when wet, my hair is stretchy but not very much. 20-30% seems about right. But honestly I'm guessing as I didn't use a ruler or anything to try and get actual measurements.\n\n**History:** I am a 38 year old female and I have only ever dyed my hair twice before. I was in my 20s both times. I do not use heat styling except for special occasions so maybe twice a year. I will blow dry my hair occasionally as going to bed with wet hair is a problem for me, but I prefer to let my hair air dry and do so most of the time. I do not use hairspray, gel, or mousse except when I heat style for special occasions.\n\n**My goals**: I am tired of my hair being oily and greasy all the time. I want a low maintenance hair care routine. (I know that it will take extra work during transition). I want to get rid of my frizziness and unmanaged look. I would very much like to stop buying shampoo. I want to be Water Only if possible.\n\n**My current routine**:  I have been washing my hair on Sundays and Wednesday with Herbal Essences Smooth Rose Hips Hair Smoothing Shampoo. Maybe once a month I will use the matching Herbal Essences Conditioner on my tips. Occasionally I will use Clean Freak: Not Your Mother's Dry Shampoo spray on Saturday's before going to visit my in-laws for presentability. I have used nothing else in my hair for at least the last 3 months, and probably longer than that.\n\n**Herbal Essences Smooth Rose Hips Hair Smoothing Shampoo:**  **Ingredients**: Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide Mea, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium Edta, Peg-60 Almond Glycerides, Linoleamidopropyl Pg-dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Yellow 5, Blue 1.\n\n***I put this shampoo into the tool mentioned in the pinned post and it turned up sulfates but no silicone, so I am assuming that I don't need a clarifying wash.

Rye flour is quite popular.  Since you have soft water,  you have quite a few options.  There's a link in the sidebar with a number of options in it.\n\nI do have an unrelated question.

I was hopeful that I'd be pleasantly surprised and that water only would make my hair look cleaner even if it was just for a day. Unfortunately, now that my hair is dry, it still looks like I poured a bottle of oil on it. I read in someone else's post that their hair would be oily after washing but it would be better the next morning. I'm hoping for some of that mojo. \n\nI have also started looking into LowPoo as a possibility to get through the oily transition if it's going to be this bad. Curlsbot.com recommended the  Not Your Mother's Blue Sea Kale & Pure Coconut Water Sea Minerals Shampoo and Conditioner.

I’ve never had an allergic reaction.\n\nI FINALLY, at 26, have found a hair color that really suits me and I love! I’ve been fake blonde forever but I can’t keep up with it. My color is definitely copper. \n\nThe hair dye itself, I asked the salon about. They said it’s very gentle and has never caused an allergic reaction. Despite that, after a few days I got a BAD one and had to go to urgent care. Eyes swollen nearly shut, itching and burning, hives and swelling all over my ears, cheeks and eyes. \n\nNo reaction on my scalp or neck aside from hives on my actual forehead along my hairline. You’d think a hair product allergy would hurt my scalp and neck too?\n\nI am no stranger to allergic reactions to weird things. Never to hair dye or hair products before, but mystery hives and swelling on my eyes isn’t abnormal. Always wondered why it’s always my eyes? \n\nI’ve tried two copper toning conditioners since the original incident (it wasn’t originally clear that the hair dye had done it) and both escalated things and did the same thing to me! I ended up in urgent care again with my ears, eye lids and cheeks so swollen and messed up. So bad. So much pain. I eventually did spot tests on both arms with these products: NO REACTIONS?! \n\nBased on starting and stopping the conditioners to test things, it’s 100% the conditioners causing this. When I stop using them it clears. Start again and the hives and swelling trickle right back. They must contain the same ingredient(s) the original dye had that my body can’t handle. I wear a silk cap with my hair up and out of my face at night, silk pillow cases, detergent is cleared, no new products besides those. It’s definitely the dye and conditioners. \n\nI was on every allergy med under the sun. Both trips to urgent care and they gave me prednisone. Steroids were the only thing that actually put a dent in this thing. \n\nI’m at a complete loss here and need some help. I’ve used Copper Overtone and Copper Keracolor. Neither use PPD as an ingredient and also I’ve never had a reaction to hair color before. Had every color in the past. What could be this mystery ingredient that’s doing this to my eyes and face!? I’d love to work around this and keep my copper color with some kind of alternative product, but I can’t figure out what could be causing it. It’d also be really tough to get this color out of my hair so keeping it is worlds easier than taking it all out and going blonde again. \n\nI’m allergic to nickel and that’s it! Very sensitive skin though.\n\nThank you!!!

        "body": "where do you live?\n\nYour mystery hives on your eyes could be from something environmental.\n\nHere's a good example: Let's say you live 50 miles from a sawmill. That sawmill mills longleaf pine. now, when the winds shift direction it blows in the pollen spores from the milling of the longleaf pine and gives you a reaction.\n\nThe pollen enters your nose, and (most people people have a deviated septum) the pollen gets stuck due to the deviation and possible large turbines in the nose. now the pollen has nowhere to go because it's stuck. It makes its way to the eyes because it a portal of entry. now its inside the sinus cavity, entering the nose and getting into your eyes. One side might always be worse than the other side.\n\nI've done 8 years of research on this. maybe I can point you in a direction or the type of doctor who would know your problem. I was a medical mystery until I did my own scientific  research. ( I have a master degree- MS in climate change and public health, and a BSN.)\n\nYou might not be allergic to the product you are using, but based on where you reside and what pollutants/allergens are present in the air, the chemical reaction between the product you are using and whatever in in the air is creating the mysterious allergy on your forehead/hairline because your skin is sensitive.\n\nDoctors only treat primary issues and not secondary. they also do not take into account things that could be the culprit based on where you live.

That being said, I've seen a lot of really inaccurate science-y stuff on that site, but I haven't paid close attention to the authors and whether any of that was written by McKay.\n\nI see elsewhere in the article that they have grouped sodium cocoyl isethionate as being just as strong a cleanser as SLS or SLES because it's anionic, but elsewhere I've read that it's quite gentle.

        "body": "I think you're right to be skeptical of these claims made by random people on social media.  It's also worth noting that these are generalizations about an entire brand of products.  Unless they know something specific about the company itself and their manufacturing processes or philosophy or something that would affect all of their products, they may be taking a problem with one product by that company and inappropriately applying it to all the rest.\n\nI haven't heard these claims so I have no additional insights as to why some people are critical of Skala.  But the ingredients don't look particularly concerning re: causing damage to the hair.  They are commonly used in many hair products.  Generally the only way a conditioning product could damage the hair is indirectly, if the hair needs more conditioning than that product can offer.  Conditioner helps protect the hair from environmental and mechanical damage, so if the hair is left insufficiently protected AND is exposed to potentially damaging things (which it's hard to avoid because that includes brushing and friction against everything it touches, sun exposure, washing/water, etc) then it could lead to further damage.  But otherwise I don't think it's possible for a conditioning product to be damaging to the hair.  So if your hair is in pretty good condition  (doesn't have much chemical or heat damage) and feels soft and smooth when using this product, then this product is sufficient for YOU as far as the conditioning it offers.  But that may not be the case for someone else whose hair is more damaged.\n\nI do find it concerning that it contains Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone, which are known allergy sensitizers and allergens.  If it's imported from Brazil, I don't know what the safety regulations in Brazil are as far as limiting the use of these ingredients, or how strictly any existing regulations are followed.  Methylchloroisothiazolinone & Methylisothiazolinone (often used together) are prohibited from use in leave-in products in Europe due to their ability to sensitize people to become allergic to them and limited in the US to only 0.01% in rinse-off products, even lower for leave-in products.  There has been an \"epidemic of allergy\" to these preservatives in the last decade or so which is likely due to their increased use as a replacement for parabens (which have a much safer track record but have been unfairly demonized) as preservatives.\n\nThe problem with Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone is explained succinctly in [this longer Haircare myth debunking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLttCDPCADY&t=1718s) by Dr. Michelle Wong (the link goes directly to the segment addressing these ingredients but I recommend watching the whole thing when you have time!).\n\nAdditional info:\n\n[https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/detail/9021/methylchloroisothiazolinone/](https://cosmileeurope.eu/inci/detail/9021/methylchloroisothiazolinone/)\n\n[https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/methylchloroisothiazolinone-and-methylisothiazolinone/](https://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/methylchloroisothiazolinone-and-methylisothiazolinone/)",

So she brought up \"hey you should try a rosemary shampoo I heard it helps with dry scalp!\" so I was like, alright I'll give it a shot... Well I get home that night with Pacifica Rosemary Shampoo & Conditioner in hand, I'm showering and everything is going normal, I put the shampoo in, rinse, and then the conditioner...\n\nAnd now here's where the weird thing happens, about 3 seconds after lathering the conditioner in my hair, it started fizzing/foaming A LOT! It sounded like I was cooking bacon on my head! Lol!!! A few seconds after that I started to get severe eye/respiratory irritation and had no choice but to end the shower at that moment.\n\nI'm very confused on why this happened... I don't know much about chemistry, however I did work in the petroleum industry in the past so I know some basics. Also, I tried the Shampoo & Conditioner a day later and the same reaction did not occur...??? Nothing else was in my hair (that I know of) besides water & what was left of the shampoo after rinsing, and oh, I shower daily haha. I tried recreating this by putting a small amount of water in a bowl, and the products, but nothing happened. I even tried mixing it with other hygiene products I may have used...Nothing!\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here has any clues as to why this happened!?\n\n[Here are the products.](https://www.amazon.com/Pacifica-Rosemary-Invigorating-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B098RCTB95/ref=asc_df_B098RCTB95/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692875362841&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4265248125972540294&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9026243&hvtargid=pla-2281435180778&psc=1&mcid=ac6d5d9ec6603371afb61ac940814a75&hvocijid=4265248125972540294-B098RCTB95-&hvexpln=73&gad_source=1)\n\nand Ingredients:\n\n**ROSEMARY PURIFY INVIGORATING CONDITIONER**\n\nRosemary\n\nMint\n\nLemon balm\n\nSpirulina\n\nJojoba\n\nSunflower oil\n\n*aqua, cetrimonium chloride, cetyl alcohol, sorbitol, panthenol (vitamin B5), caprylic/capric triglyceride, hydrolyzed soy protein, stearyl alcohol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, salix alba (willow) bark extract, tocopherols (vitamin E), rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, tilia cordata flower extract, glycerin, sambucus nigra (elderberry) fruit extract, vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract, melissa officinalis (lemon balm) extract, menthol, spirulina maxima extract, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, polysorbate 60, behentrimonium methosulfate, cetearyl alcohol, soy lecithin, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, ethylhexylglycerin, parfum (natural).*\n\n**Rosemary Purify Clarifying Shampoo**\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nRosemary\n\nMint\n\nSpirulina\n\n*aqua, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium C14-16 olefin sulfonate, lauryl glucoside, stearyl citrate, glycerin, panthenol (vitamin B5),rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf oil, hydrolyzed soy protein, sambucus nigra fruit extract, salix alba (willow) bark extract, tilia cordata flower extract, vitis vinifera (grape) seed extract, melissa officinalis extract, menthol, spirulina maxima extract, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, ethylhexylglycerin, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, parfum (natural)*.",

        "body": "Reaction that fast sounds like an acid - base neutralization.  It's how we make fizzy candy like sherbert or a bunch of other foaming products.\n\nConditioner is normally formulated acidic, usually pH 4-5 but can be as low as 3.  It's because that's optimal to keep the cationic surfacants stable (cetrimonium chloride).\n\nShampoo is normally formulated slightly basic, up to about pH 9.  Skipping a lot of background, higher pH helps strip oils from your hair, but too high and it starts to damage the hair.  You can DIY a really cheap/poor clarifying shampoo with just baking soda and enough water to make it into a paste.\n\nOccasionally, sometimes, what can happen with shampoo / conditioner / yogurt is called \"syneresis\".  It's when the liquid oozes out from the main product to the top or bottom.  You may know it from natural yogurt when the liquid separates and floats to the top.  You may notice this with flavour yogurts when there is a layer of fruit on the top or bottom, that's not lazy mixing or color advertising, that's someone hiding that their yogurt separates.  This is one good reason to use opaque containers instead of clear, but the marketing/cost of that is way more complicated.\n\nFor you, that means you cannot replicate the test.  The liquid products separated during transport + time.\n\nYou don't have to look far to see that both shampoo and conditioner are both eye and respiratory irritants.  It's not considered a strong mode of contact because they are diluted when you use them and non-volatile, thickened so they don't spray.  But if you ever do spray a fine mist into a room - holy shit that burns.  Baby or no-more-tears shampoo uses more sensitive ingredients but they are more expensive and less effective.\n\ntl;dr product separated during transport creating an acidic (mostly water) layer in conditioner and a basic (mostly water) layer in shampoo.  You mixed those on your head and the reaction created a bubbly foam that sprayed mist of soap into the air.  You then breathed in soap and got it in your eyes.  The soap irritated the sensitive mucous membranes in eyes/respiratory tract.  It may have lowered the surface tension to allow other ingredients, but the soap component alone is sufficient to be an irritant.",
