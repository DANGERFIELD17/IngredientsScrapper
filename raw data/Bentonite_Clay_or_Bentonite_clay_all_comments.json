    "body": "I hope this doesn‚Äôt constitute a selfie? It‚Äôs to show my skin and my concerns. Anyway. I‚Äôm 43 and I feel like I look it all of a sudden, and I hate it, HATE it, and have been really, really struggling to feel good about my appearance for the past few years as financial issues, health issues, stress, a toxic work environment, and grief all took their toll‚Ä¶and I know that as a dude I‚Äôm not ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to care. But unfortunately I do. I just feel like I look‚Ä¶weird‚Ä¶and my skin sucks. I mean, granted, in this photo I have helmet hair from skateboarding and I am not in good lighting, plus I was outside and exerting myself, so maybe I‚Äôm extra blotchy and the lighting is not flattering. But even so. I don‚Äôt feel attractive anymore and it makes me super sad. \n\nMy point, and I do have one haha, is, I have what seems like a permanent red nose now. I guess it‚Äôs rosacea..? It just kinda became a thing over the past couple of years. And I don‚Äôt know why, and want to fix it. Trust me, that‚Äôs the least of it. My friend recommended fraxel laser to even out my skin texture. :-/\n\nMy other question is how do I avoid ending up with Steve Buscemi eyes as life goes on? Should I get a lower eyelid procedure of some sort? Upper AND lower? Can they do one eye at a time?? If I say my eyelashes are always going in my eyes (truth because they‚Äôre like 8 inches long, tbf), will insurance cover it?\n\nSorry, that was several questions. Also, sorry I look like I‚Äôm about to punch someone. I think it‚Äôs my eyebrows. Which, I was a goth kid in the 90s. So now I fill them in a bit. \n\nMy routine: I shower at night and wash my face with either cerave or this cetaphil nighttime face wash that has hyaluronic acid in it. Then I put on St Ives collagen elastin moisturizer and then sometimes, a thin layer of either aquaphor or bio-oil. In the morning, I use this glycolic acid face wash (it‚Äôs a really low percentage), neutrogena sunscreen, and every few days I‚Äôll use vitamin C micellar toning water after that. \n\nEvery week I do a bentonite clay mask (but I aquaphor my face beforehand and I mix it with water). It seems if I don‚Äôt physically exfoliate, my pores fill up with a massive amount of crap and I sometimes get cystic acne. Due to this, I‚Äôve also started rotating in Differin gel at night, and so far it seems like I‚Äôm tolerating it ok. \n\nMy skin feels smooth, and smoothER than before I started doing all this, for sure‚Ä¶it just doesn‚Äôt look it, if that makes sense..? and I feel my forehead is a disaster lmao. I have some areas of my face where it‚Äôs like these really deep pores..? And some ice pick scarring. And like I said, my nose sucks for sure. \n\nPlease be kind, I‚Äôve been having a rough time lately and it‚Äôs taken a massive amount of courage to finally post my face here. I think I just need some help getting out of my own head with all this and figuring out solutions. Also, I‚Äôm looking into going to a dermatologist. Thanks everyone. ",

Guessing you looked younger than your age before and it is just a shock to look your age all the sudden :) \n\nYour routine sounds great.  Before you jump to lasers and surgery I'd start with some other simple additions.  \n\nDual cleansing with a cleansing oil before your standard water based cleanser (one of the OGs is softymo speedy and it's super cheap and effective.  Like dissolves like.  It's the chemistry of how water will blend with water and oil with oil but not each other.  Your skin has both an oil glands component and a water based component to stay flexible.  By using both cleaners you open and flush oil glands as well as rinse out the water based sweats and things.  \n\nSecondly I'd say get a dermal stamp.  They're cheap.  Better than the rollers and help with the scarring and uneven texture.  \n\nThen it's probably time for a higher retinoid/tretinoin which will further improve the smoothness and appearance even further.  I really like the SomeByMi retinol intense cause it has 3 vitamin A derivatives and calming agents to minimize the irritation\n\nAs far as the eye thing.  Good sleep.  Hydration.

        "body": "Good for you for building a routine!  If I can make some suggestions to help you get the most of each step and to avoid causing irritation (which can lead to acne):\n\n1.  Move your glycolic to evening vs morning.  It chemically exfoliates and will make your skin more susceptible to sun damage and irritation.  It can also impact the pH of your Vitamin C, which can both reduce efficacy and increase irritation.  Best not to use the same nights as a retinoid (Differin or Tretinoin).  Use a gentle cleanser with no acids when you are applying those. \n2.  Use your Vitamin C after your cleanser and not over other products.  If it‚Äôs in micellar water form - or serum, which is recommended - it should be the first thing you apply.  Your lightest, more liquid formulas always go first, then you build up to moisturizer, then SPF. \n3.  Agree with people recommending to use sunscreen every day‚Ä¶ non-negotiable, if you do add Tretinoin.  \n4.  Moisturize at night too \n5.  If you have the funds, a good professional treatment routine can help immensely!  SkinPen microneedling is a universally great treatment for all of your concerns.  And lasers can help, but you HAVE to be mindful of the sun for a few weeks.  I would do it now, or save it for fall - never too close to or during summer.  \n\nTL;DR:  \n\nAM - \nGentle cleanser + vitamin c + moisturizer + SPF \n\nPM - \nGentle cleanser + Differin/Tret + moisturizer OR \n[Chemical] exfoliating cleanser + moisturizer \n\n\nSource:  ~15 years of product development for skincare brands including sensitive skin, anti-aging and acne products",

        "body": "Start with the basics‚Ä¶ get a good vitamin c, double cleanse (alternating the 2nd cleanse with an active cleanser similar to the glycolic cleanser you have every other night. If it‚Äôs too harsh and skin barrier feels irritated, skip an extra night), retinol (night only), moisturizer, sunscreen (mineral /daytime only). If you feel froggy and confident and want to incorporate more, add some eye cream and a serum. When applying products remember, thinnest to thickest. Retinol always goes on skin dry and before your moisturizer. Avoid eyes. \n\nMy favorite vitamin c is by SkinBetter. It is a little pricey but the Alto Advance Defense & Repair is hands down my all time go to. This vitamin c is not only packed with over 10 antioxidants, but it helps with sun damage and sun exposure. I‚Äôm also a huge fan of their Alpha Ret collection. People on Reddit like to promote tretinoin like it‚Äôs something everybody can handle but it‚Äôs definitely not. There‚Äôs a lot of dryness and irritation with tretinoin. I like SkinBetter Alpha Ret, because it‚Äôs not a retinol, it‚Äôs a form of tretinoin but formulated  in a way to be more tolerable on the skin but also pack a punch that helps get the results we need. They have an Alpha Ret Overnight Cream that uses the retinoid and glycolic acid combo and there‚Äôs also an Alpha Ret Clearing Serum that is a combo of salicylic, lactic and Retinoid. Salicylic is great for oily skin and congestion. Glycolic is great for dull skin because it enhances the skin‚Äôs brightness. \n\nI‚Äôm a licensed esthetician here in the Denver area. If you‚Äôre interested in trying what I mentioned I can mail you some samples. (:\n\nNow, not talking skin care, there are some good lasers out there that help with revitalizing the skin and can combat redness. I know you mentioned finances being a concern so that might not be something you‚Äôre able to do now, but keep it in mind. Micro needling is another favorite of mine. It‚Äôs been around for ages and with our without radio frequency, the results are there if done correctly. \n\nI probably gave you a lot more information than you know what to do with, but you can always DM me. I love helping people with their skin. \n\nXOXO\n\nP.s. I was addicted to  SkinCeuticals LHA cleanser but we no longer carried it where I work, so I switched to Paula‚Äôs Choice Effaclar medicated cleanser that has 2% salicylic acid. It can cause my skin to get a little dry if I use it too often, but for someone who also struggles with gunk in my pores it has helped a lot, without hurting the bank.\n\n\nEdit: La Roche Posay Effaclar cleanser.

        "body": "Honestly your skin isn't that bad. You're being hard on yourself. However, there's nothing wrong with wanting better either :)\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n\n**Sunscreen** \\- I'm guessing the fine lines on the forehead are because you didn't consistently wear sunscreen in prior years. Somewhere between the ages of 35 and 45 all those days of not wearing sunscreen as teens and 20-soemthings catches up to us in the form of wrinkles and sometimes discoloration (brownish spots or reddish spots or broken blood vessels). So, now & going forward, just apply sunscreen with at least SPF 40 *every single day*. Even just commuting to/from work in a car will expose you to too much damaging sun rays. If you're going to be doing any sort of outdoor activity for 45 minutes or more, then try to go with SPF 50 or 60. This is the #1 thing you can do. You can use other topical skin care or even professional treatments, but if you don't wear sunscreen daily, your skin won't improve.\n\n**Pores:**\n\nYou really don't need a clay mask or any sort of physical/scrub type exfoliation. Trust me. What you do need is a good serum or toner exfoliator that has both AHAs (glycolic and lactic acids) and BHA (salicylic acid). AHAs help to strip off all the old/dead skin cells (which like to hang on for dear life as we get older), whereas BHA cleans out your pores and prevents pimples/acne. And you need to use it at least twice/week (depending on the strength). Very few brands combine a meaningful amount of AHAs & BHA in the same formula, but it's really the easiest and most effective way to go. My favorite one is the [Paula's Choice 10% Advanced Smoothing Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/resist-advanced-smoothing-treatment-10pct-aha/7651.html). However, as a beginner, this one might be too strong because these are ingredients your skin needs to build a tolerance to. So, you might want to start out with their [5% formula](https://www.paulaschoice.com/resist-daily-smoothing-treatment-with-5pct-aha/766.html) first. You cannot use these on the same night as a retinoid (like Differin), so just rotate nights -- or -- use the exfoliating AHAs/BHA in the morning and retinoids at night. The choice is yours. ***I honestly think using AHAs/BHA will give you the most immediate results.*** There are other options for AHAs & BHA in the same bottle, including [Bliss Pro Liquid Exfoliant](https://www.amazon.com/Bliss-BlissProTM-Liquid-Exfoliant/dp/B0BRYP5P67/ref=sr_1_3) (works more like a \"peel\" which needs to be rinsed off & only use once or twice a week max) or the [Pixi Clarity Acid Peel ](https://www.amazon.com/Pixi-Beauty-Clarity-Acid-Peel/dp/B01J62OO4K)(also must be rinsed off).\n\n**No Aquaphor or Bio Oil**\n\nThese are not great for skin on your face (except for certain circumstances). So stop putting these on your face, they'll just clog your pores and make acne more likely. Also, if you have moisturizers, check their ingredient labels and make sure they don't contain petrolatum (same thing as Vaseline) or shea butter. Both of those will clog pores too. There are better ingredients for hydrating and strengthening the skin that don't clog pores. Good ingredients are: glycerin (close to top of the list is better), squalane, ceremides, pathenol, niacinamide, and sodium hyaluronate. Those can all be found in affordable brands and are also used by high-end brands too.\n\n**Moisturizer**\n\nI highly recommend switching to either [Vanicream Daily Facial Moisturizer](https://www.vanicream.com/product/vanicream-daily-facial-moisturizer) (in 3 oz tube) or [La Roche Posay Double Repair](https://www.laroche-posay.us/our-products/face/face-moisturizer/toleriane-double-repair-face-moisturizer-tolerianedoublerepair.html). Both are drugstore brands -- both hydrating and not pore clogging. They both have ingredients that strengthen the skin barrier including ceremides.",

Mas nag worst pa siya ng gumamit ako ng ibat ibang products.\n\nThese are the products that I have used before my pimples got worse:\n\nDefensil Bar Soap\nCathy Doll Acne Solution Serum Foam Cleanser\nEskinol Pimple Fighting Facial Cleanser\nGarnier micellar cleansing water\nCeleteque Spot Corrector\nCetaphil Gentle Cleanser\nCetaphil Bar Soap\nClean & Clear Moisturizer\nSt. Ives Renewing Moisturizer Collagen & Elastin\nLuxe Organix Bentonite Clay Mask\n\nKumalma lang yung pimples ko ng gumamit ako ng Cathy Doll tapos after gumamit ako ng rejuvenating set pero bumalik ulit kasi gumamit ako ng set na glass skin kaya gumamit ako ng ibang rejuv na ni recommend ng friend ko ayon kumalma yung pimples ko pero yung mga comedones ko andyan pa din. I decided to stop na kasi naging sensitive yung mukha ko tapos yung mukha ko ang amputi na parang letson sa kintab. Parang di normal. Last year I ended up with a dermatologist kasi yung mukha ko pag hinawakan mo ang rough but now di na. Kita padin yung mga acne scars na maliit na holes. Bilib ako sa boyfriend ko di niya ako iniwan kahit na ang dami ng pimples sa mukha ko. Grabe bully natangap ko dati. No need na daw ako bumili ng bigas kasi madami na yung akin.",

    "body": "One year on carnivore diet. Down 20 lbs (163 lbs -> 143 lbs, 5‚Äô6‚Äù). Same outfit and the shorts were basically falling off. Prior to carnivore was going through some situational depression and needed a change. Made the switch and my mental health has gotten so much better. I originally heard about carnivore on Instagram from a video by steak and butter gal, Bella. \n\nI still have a very iffy relationship with the gym and went sporadically through the past year. Got out a lot more on walks and overall just have more mental energy to do everyday things. \n\nThrough the year I have also cut back dramatically on drinking going from 1/2 a bottle of wine a night (2-3 standard drinks) to maybe having 20-30 drinks all year which is less than what I would usually have in a couple of weeks. Drinking now gives me acid reflux and I realize how crappy it makes me feel in the days after. \n\nMy only real ‚Äúcheat‚Äù was eating 1/2 a plate of homemade pasta we made ourselves in Italy, some olives in France and some homemade sauerkraut on st Patrick‚Äôs day. \n\nI never went fully lion diet and eat all meats and kept in dairy. I have 8 oz of half and half 1-2 times a day in cappuccinos and .5-1 stick of butter daily. I track my food sporadically and am usually eating around 2,000-2,500 calories daily. Never consumed liver or organs expect from some capsules. I ordered 1 bottle 6 months ago and I am still getting through that. \n\nI do some fasting, I completed 3 72 hour fasts and naturally intermittent fast 16:8 daily. If I don‚Äôt intermittent fast, that‚Äôs fine I am not very strict on it. \n\nMy benefits I‚Äôve seen: \n\n- Mental health improvement \n- hypoglycemia completely went away and I have sustainable energy throughout the day\n- no bloating through the day\n- my skin looks much better and I don‚Äôt feel the need to wear make up really anymore \n- I‚Äôm noticing I have new hair growth\n- my gum line is back to normal. I used to have ‚Äúsmall‚Äù teeth and extremely sensitive and bloody gums and it turns out it was all inflammation. My teeth look bigger and my teeth have not bled in the last year at all whereas before they would bleed every time I ate or brushed my teeth. \n-painless and regular periods. I rely on an app to tell me when it‚Äôs coming because I have no symptoms leading up to my menstrual cycle. \n- easy weight loss. That wasn‚Äôt even one of my reasons for starting this way of eating\n- eye floaters went away. I used to always have little black spots that would appear when I blinked now I don‚Äôt see them anymore \n- little to no body odor \n- side benefit is eating this way led me to eliminating a lot of other toxins in my life like certain cleaning products, scented anything, cosmetics, dental care, wearing less polyester etc. I now only use homemade tallow soap on my body and face, liquid tallow soap for shampoo, beef tallow deodorant, beef tallow for moisturizer, homemade tallow sunscreen for my face, and fluoride free and sweetener free powdered bentonite clay toothpaste. \n\nMy main reason for switching to this way of eating was for fertility so I guess in that respect it hasn‚Äôt been successful, but I feel I am on the right path and hopefully that will happen soon. No plan to stop any time soon. \n\nSupplement I use\n- keto chow daily mineral drops 2 teaspoons in the morning \n- iodine 7-10 drops of 2% lugols \n- BLK mineral drops for my water because i drink reverse osmosis\n- occasionally paleo valley essential C (not carnivore) \n- occasionally paleo valley wild caught fish roe \n- ritual prenatal vitamins (not carnivore) \n\nNot sure if I‚Äôm missing anything but overall, it‚Äôs been a very successful year for me and I‚Äôm so glad I found this WOE.

    "body": "After struggling with the debilitating symptoms of candida overgrowth and herxheimer die off reactions from trying to manage the condition, I believe I have finally beaten it. I was plagued with depression, brain fog, and fatigue for 5-6 years as I struggled with half-measured treatment protocols before sufficiently educating myself on the candida diet, finally working with a naturopath, and committing to do whatever it took to get better. I almost achieved remission after a year of sticking to my protocol below, but a course of antibiotics set me back, and it has taken just under a full year to get back to where I am now. I have so far successfully reintroduced fruit, dairy, and beans back into my diet with no repercussions, and I plan on continuing to add more back in while staying on my probiotic regimen. Even if I'm not able to get back to eating/drinking alcohol, gluten, or sugary foods, I feel finally able to live a happy life with a less restricted diet and an insanely elevated feeling of physical and mental health compared to years past.\n\n3.28.24 Edit: I've had some flare ups and had to cut out fruit/dairy temporarily again :( . I'm currently exploring a prescription antifungal treatment. That being said, the treatment protocol below is still what has enabled me to come so far. I'm hopeful to get fruit/dairy back soon, and hopefully more foods with my next treatment approach.\n\n**My treatment protocol:**  \n**The non-negotiables:**\n\n* Zero cheat, Candida diet. Only meat, non-starchy vegetables, almonds/pecans, and eggs. Yes, this is hard. But yes, you can do it. Try to recognize when mood disorders are exacerbating how insurmountable the diet feels. Also, buy an air fryer.\n* Start slowwww with antifungals such as coconut oil, oregano oil, and something like Candida-X. Also eventually use a biofilm breaker like Klaire Labs Interfase Plus. I also like Silver Fern NanoScrub. Allow days in between for the body to clear out the die off toxins. Later on it felt important to ease off most antifungals except coconut oil to not also kill good bacteria. At the very end I did coconut oil just twice a week and probiotics/sacch b every day.\n* A good probiotic such as Klaire Therbiotic Complete. Avoid fermented probiotics like kefir and kimchi. These only caused flair ups for me and havent been necessary to achieve success.\n* Saccharomyces Boulardii (probiotic yeast). This was the single biggest noticeable improvement in my depression and candida recovery. Absolute game changer. After my antibiotics set me back, I had to cycle antifungals for a while before SacchB could start turning the tide though. Its not enough to combat the bad yeast on its own.\n* Multi-vitamin and mineral. I use TrueHope vitamins that 100% helped with my depression as a result of candida/leaky gut depriving me of essential nutrients. The candida diet will also give muscle cramps for a while so bone broth and multi-vitamins help manage that. TrueHope is a mental health vitamin/candida supplement company in Canada with support people that are lovely and (relatively) well educated on candida.\n* Working with a naturopath. My ND turned me onto Sacch Boullardii, which I might not have found otherwise. Even if you can find the supplement stack you need on reddit, having someone to do stool testing, and be a sounding board for when to switch to different phases of the treatment protocol was huge for me. The mood dysregulation of candida and die off makes it hard to do this on your own.\n\n**The nice to haves / confusing gray areas:**\n\n* L-Glutamine for gut lining repair\n* Sauna and Binders like charcoal, bentonite clay to manage die off\n* Silver Fern Cleanse (immunoglobulins) / Colostrum - I can‚Äôt say for sure if this helped\n* Only attempt reintroducing low sugar berries after antifungals start causing less of a die off effect. This took 9 months for me. Somehow adding berries back in when I got to that point seemed to help stabilize my mood even more. I cant explain it, but maybe good bacteria thrives of the fruit fiber/FODMAPs once you can get the candida at bay.\n* My stool testing through my ND didnt show Candida, but its maybe because I was already months into the treatment protocol. It did show a common parasite called blastocystis. I think treating that with antibiotics was a mistake. Some doctors dont consider blastocystis to be pathogenic.\n\n**Stay away from**\n\n* MSM (sulfur)- Some people say this helped them, but it fucked me way up. And I confirmed it wasn‚Äôt die off I was experiencing.\n* Fermented probiotics\n\n**Other rare symptoms**\n\n* Exercise/strength training made me noticeably more depressed before/during treatment. I believe it pushed more candida toxins from my muscles into my blood stream. The multi-vitamin and treatment protocol eventually made this go away.\n\nI didnt always have hope and believe that beating this was possible. But now I do. Hope for me, and hope for you, even if you can‚Äôt feel it right now. Please feel free to ask me anything.\n\n[A happy lad. ](https://preview.redd.it/8n457arwqi1c1.jpg?width=1968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df98f3ebb2453c4fd7b03e3abb9008ce0e24ecad)",

Look up heat killed probiotics studies and you will see amazing results. Just take the probiotics. Don‚Äôt worry about your herbs killing them because even if they do, they still work in other areas\n\nAlso I do think it is important to take lactobacillus and bifidobacteria along with saccromyces Bilardi to give a better foundation to the whole gut Microbiome instead of just sacrifices bilardi alone. \nRemember, we are trying to grow a vibrant sustainable garden in our gut, and too much of one particular plant can hurt all of the other beneficial plants. Just like mint took over my garden\nDr. Russcio even recommends taking lactobacillus plus bifidobacterium plus saccromyces a Bilardi plus spore based bacillus all three types at the same time.

Intense emotions, sadness, anger, and very profound loss of enjoyment of life and joy in general. It is hard to witness, let alone see your loved ones life crash before both of your eyes. \n\nI was thinking exercise would help? What types of exercise did you find that worked other than strength training? You mentioned a multi vitamin that helped with the toxin release into muscle tissue, maybe I read too fast, but could you plug the one you used, please?

    "body": "Hey guys! I thought it would be helpful to make a VERY basic guide for those who are just starting out. This is a basic guide for at-home treatment of acne. This guide is a work in progress and is not by any means a comprehensive guide.\n\n#**Please see a dermatologist if your acne does not improve with Over-The-Counter treatments.**#\n\n If you have cystic or hormonal acne, they tend to be pretty difficult to treat with topicals so you might want to see a dermatologist right away. \n\n# Basic skincare routine#\n\n\n1\\. Get a gentle cleanser that does not break you out. There are drugstore brands such as CeraVe and Cetaphil that are easily accessible.\n\n\n- CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser (contains salicylic acid)\n\n- Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\n\n\n2\\. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. \n\n3\\. Apply a toner (optional): There are toners containing Salicylic Acid (helps unclog pores which in turn helps prevent acne) or Glycolic Acid (helps exfoliate dead skin cells and also can help prevent acne). \n\nFor example: \n\n- CosRX is a reputable Korean skincare brand. They have toners containing both of these ingredients. You can buy them at your local asian beauty stores or on ebay.\n\n- Clinique's Acne Solutions Clarifying Lotion (contains salicylic acid). Clinique is easily available in department stores or at retailers like Sephora.\n\n- Pixi Glow Tonic toner (contains glycolic acid) They are sold at Target or are available via their website. \n\n- Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner (contains glycolic acid)\n\n- L'Oreal Dermo Expertise Hydrafresh Toner (contains salicylic acid)\n\n\n4\\. Apply a generous amount of Benzoyl Peroxide: 2.5% is just as effective as 10%. However, BP 10% is most commonly found in drugstores. Apply 1x or 2x daily. Consistency is important. \n\n[Clean & Clear¬Æ Persa-Gel¬Æ10 Acne Medication-1 Oz] (http://www.target.com/p/clean-clear-persa-gel-10-acne-medication-1-oz/-/A-12921120?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&CPNG=PLA_Health+Beauty+Shopping&adgroup=SC_Health+Beauty&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9004369&gclid=CjwKEAiAu6DBBRDDr6-e_6698E0SJACvuxnydTqukAqv90zKP_zWxbsuEeH_BaN7jPrfELaB-RLX4hoCVDLw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) \n\n[La Roche Posay Effaclar Duo Dual Action Acne Treatment 1.35 oz] (http://www.target.com/p/la-roche-posay-effaclar-duo-dual-action-acne-treatment-1-35-oz/-/A-14225592)\n\n\n\n\n5\\. Get a gentle moisturizer that does not break you out. There are drugstore brands such as CeraVe and Cetaphil that are easily accessible.\n\n\n\n\n6\\. Apply a sunscreen  before you go out: many active ingredients used for treatment of acne such as Benzoyl Peroxide and Alpha Hydroxy Acid can increase photosensitivity. Therefore, treat sunscreen as part of your skincare hygiene and apply sunscreen daily. \n\n\n\n7\\. Do not pop your pimples as it can cause a lot of unnecessary scarring. Let it heal on its own.\n\n#Additional Add-Ons#\n\n1\\. After trying Benzoyl Peroxide for a few weeks to few months, then it is a good time to start experimenting with other active ingredients such as Salicylic Acid/Alpha Hydroxy Acid/Retinol. \n\n- Salicylic Acid helps unclog pores and can be easily incorporated into your skincare routine either as a topical or as a toner.\n\n- Alpha Hydroxy Acids help exfoliate the outer layer of your skin and is shown to be efficacious in terms of acne treatment. You can apply AHA every night and some tingling/irritation is expected at first. (Apply sunscreen during the day)\n\n-  Retinol works by unclogging pores. (Apply sunscreen during the day). Retinol can cause irritation/redness/dryness. Start out by using it every other day and see how your skin reacts to it first. \n\n2\\. For those with oily skin, you can try using face masks that contain clay. Bentonite clay helps absorb excess oil so you can do a face mask 1x or 2x a week. Queen Helene's Mint Julep Mask is a cult classic and it also contains sulphur which helps dry out pimples. Keep in mind that this will only bring temporary relief and will not permanently reduce oil production.\n\n3\\. For those in the US, Differin (retinoid) is now available over the counter. If you are going to use Differin, discontinue using Retinol. Some people experience dryness, peeling, and redness when they start using Differin. Try it out by using it every other day and see how your skin reacts to it.\n\n\n#Body acne help#\n\n1\\. Many people do not wash their backs. Get a bath towel like Salux brand in which you will be able to wash your back with much ease.\n\n2\\. Use body washes containing Salicylic Acid: You can try something like Neutrogena's Body Wash (contains Salicylic Acid 2%)\n\n[Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash] (http://www.neutrogena.com/product/body+clear-+body+wash.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Body+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sASrgYpC2_dc|pcrid|121181691920) \n\nAccessories\n\n[The Body Shop's Body Polisher] (http://www.thebodyshop-usa.com/shop-by-line/shop-accessories/exfoliating-skin-towel.aspx)\n\n[Salux Beauty Skin Wash Cloth] (http://saluxshop.com/products)\n\n3\\. Apply Benzoyl Peroxide every day to an affected area. If it's difficult to reach, you can get a body lotion applicator on online retailers like Amazon or Ebay and then use it to apply Benzoyl Peroxide. Look for products that are made of easy to clean materials (ex: plastic -  hard surfaces can easily be cleaned with rubbing alcohol)\n\n[There is a variety of body lotion applicators that are available online] (https://www.google.com/search?q=body+lotion+applicator&espvd=2&source=lnms&tbm=shop&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU0u-k38zRAhXszIMKHYOTByoQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=950). \n\n\n#Emergency acne care#\n\n- Buy hydrocolloid bandages and stock up on them! You can apply to pimples that have come to a head. Keep them applied overnight.\n\n- If you have cystic acne and it hurts, do not pop them. You can do a warm compress or an ice compress to try ease the pain.\n\n\n#Post acne care#\n\nCongratulations! You no longer have acne! However you may have some of these:\n\n- Do you have any dark spots? Are they flat? If so, they are called Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation. Some will fade with time but you can incorporate AHA or Retinol or chemical peels into your skincare routine. Apply them at night and don't forget your sunscreen during the day. With regards to chemical peels, start out with the lowest concentration and work your way up. Always follow the instructions on the label!\n\n- Do you have red spots? Are they flat? Some will fade with time but dark red spots might be difficult to get rid of on your own. You may have to get laser therapy afterwards. \n\n- If you have deep pitted or elevated scars, you will need to go see a dermatologist as they are very difficult to treat at home.\n\n- Do you have enlarged pores? If so, you can reduce the appearance of enlarged pores by using retinol or retinoids. \n\n- Don't forget your sunscreen!\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "About 10 years after first hearing about it and being too lazy to actually go through the steps, forgetting that whole section of the natural hair community existed, and finding the community again after struggling with constant single strand knots/split ends, dryness, tangles, and lack of definition even when my hair was soaking wet, I FINALLY decided to try the Maximum Hydration Method. \n\nGUYS. This is what I needed. And it could be what you need too (I promise this isn't an ad, but I feel like me saying it puts the thought in your head... I swear it's not.) \n\nI did the whole 7 day process (it took 16 days üò∂) starting with the Cherry Lola Treatment on day 1. It immediately brought out curls that I haven't seen in years! Every other step of the process that followed just continued to bring my curls to life. \n\nI came to love using botanical gels (UFD is my new bestie & I went through 2.5 bottles of her over this whole process üôÉ). It used to take me an hour MINIMUM to *try* to define my hair with a strong-hold gel, because I thought that's just what my hair needed. I would style it dry because my hair would literally repel water, to the point where when I posted my spray test in February, people in the comments thought I sprayed oil! I didn't think an \"easy wash n go\" was *for me*. I was very wrong and I am SO grateful to have realized this mistake. My hair just needed a detox, which I had never actually done aside from an occasional clay mask. \n\nHere are my steps:\n\n\nCherry Lola Treatment\n\n* 16oz nonfat Greek yogurt (supposed to use full-fat; I didn't read the tub üò∂)\n\n* 2tbs liquid amino acids (pretty sure I got mine at Walmart)\n\n* 2tbs baking soda\n\nLeft this on for about 30 minutes, then rinsed & started the MHM  process\n\n* 1/3 cup of conditioner (should be silicone-free, but the only ones I could find were like $20+ soooo I just used Aussie & it was fine) \n\n* 2tbs baking soda\n\nLeft for 15-30 mins & rinsed; deep conditioned with heat for an hour & rinsed\n\nClay Rinse\n\n* 1 cup Bentonite Clay \n\n* Random parts ACV & water to equal a cup (if I had an unlimited budget, I'd just do a full cup of ACV) \n\n* Eyeballed a tbs of olive oil \n\nLeft for 15-30 mins & rinsed, then applied Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in & UFD gel, sat under the dryer until it was mostly dry then diffused the roots. To stretch, I tied sections up with satin scrunchies. To style, I remove the scrunchies one section at a time, apply some oil and hit it with the concentration nozzle to loosen the curls up. \n\nDays 2-5, I just repeated the MHM process. On day 3, I did try the \"2oz KCKT conditioner, 4oz water\" combo with the baking soda instead of my Aussie conditioner, but it didn't really change the results so I went back. On day 7, I decided to switch it out for a 1:1 ACV/water mix and it wasn't bad. The purpose of this step is to lift the cuticles without stripping the hair. \n\nDay 5, I styled with the Camille Rose Curl Maker gel with The Doux Bee-girl Curl Mousse on top. It came out crunchier and left some residue at the front of my hair that I had to fix with water the next morning (another perk, water doesn't ruin the style!), and my hair was frizzier by the end of the day. I went back to my bestie the next morning.\n\n Day 6, I decided to do the CLT again; this time with full-fat Greek yogurt like I should've. I got amazing results that were better than the first time! Not sure if it was from using the correct ingredients or if it was because I've already been doing the MHM for days at that point. Day 7, I did the MHM process as normal.\n\nResults\n\nAs you can see by the last picture showing the difference in float tests from when I first posted in February to the last day of the MHM, my hair now readily accepts water and immediately sank to the bottom of the cup! It's more elongated when wet, my hair ACTUALLY gets dripping wet and it's much more defined now because my hair is HYDRATED. I love it and I love my curls, even with the heat damage ü•≤\n\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n* I have heat damage by my ears and in the front sections of my hair. Nobody's fault but my own ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \n\n* I did use a chelating shampoo (Malibu C) for the first 5 or so days, to help remove build up. You probably don't need to do this.   \n\n* The CLT should only be done once a month or once every 2 weeks, depending on how your handles protein. My hair has never had an issue so I did it about a week later. Don't do it unless you know your hair can handle it. ",

    "body": "I am like everybody else an avid thrifter. Most of my wardobe is thrifted. I also take the cleanliness of my clothes very seriously, and I happen to have a bloodhound nose. You all know those vintage/thrift smells: the obnoxious evil spray goodwill drowns their clothes in, the funky moldy damp closet smell, old lady perfume, and mothballs!!! If I bury my face in the clothes and take a deep breath and detect any gross smells, I can't wear them. I want my clothes to smell like absolutely nothing (well if it's wool I want it to smell like wool). Others may be more tolerant than me. To each their own.\n\nI've spent a psychopathic amount of time researching how to do laundry effectively and how to get rid of smells. Using fragrances in detergent and fabric softeners to drown out the gross smells doesn't count. All kinds of info exists on the internet. Some people come up with the most useless placebo ways they swear by, and some people know what's up. At the same time I don't think people pay attention to some downsides of their methods. I think it's a good idea to list all the at-home methods that have worked for me over the years. I've almost always succeeded.\n\nThe most convenient way to get rid of smells, esp mothball and perfume, is to let the dry cleaner deal with them. I'm a poor control freak so I've never been to a dry cleaner. Also, the dry cleaning liquid will degrade your wool and silk. Another often-mentioned way is to hang clothes in the sun. I live in a small apartment in Chicago so that's not an option.\n\nFirst, let's talk laundry. For conventional machine-washable fabric, you want a good detergent with enzymes and not waste it. I use persil, tide, and kirkland, the fragrance-free kinds. Unless one works in the field drenched in mud and grease, 2 tbsp per load is enough. More doesn't mean clean here. Cold/lukewarm water, delicate cycle. I also use a laundry booster concoction: an equal amounts of washing soda+borax+sodium percarbonate (oxiclean). This raises the pH of the wash water, helps detach grease and stains, and softens the water if the water is hard. The oxiclean also helps kill bacteria. For vintage dye, like on those cotton-ramie sweaters, which can bleed out a lot, I'd go easy on the booster or skip it entirely. If you want the clothes to be even more clean, pre-soak for 30 mins. Then I use vinegar (1-2 cups) or citric acid (1-2 tbsp) in the rinse cycle. This neutralizes the alkalinity of the washwater and helps rinse all the residual soap out.\n\nFor silk, I soak in the Dirty Lab handwash detergent for 30mins-1 hour, then throw it in the machine on delicate cycle, no added detergent or with some generic handwash/delicate detergent. If I want a bit more odor fighting I'd use vinegar in the rinse cycle. I don't use the DL in the machine because it's too much water and DL is expensive. I use DL because as far as I know it's one of the very few enzyme-based delicate detergents out there. Enzymes are great, but protease eats wool and silk proteins. DL has other enzymes but not protease.\n\nFor wool, the moment I'm home from the thrift, I throw the wool in the oven on a baking tray, turn the temp to 150F, and leave it there for 45 mins. Be careful not to let the clothes touch the oven walls, for paranoid reasons. Theoretically 120F works fine too. This kills any moth eggs and no it won't burn. You can also freeze the wool for 1-2 weeks but I don't have freezer space nor patience. To wash wool, I mix DL and eucalan. Usually same procedure as silk (I don't use eucalan on silk because the lanolin in eucalan can build up on silk). For worsted wool, I haven't felted anything. I handwash if I'm paranoid about felting. \n\nI throw my leather and suede jackets in the wash. Same detergent and cycle as wool and silk. If they're good quality, you don't need to baby them. If you're afraid of watermarks on suede, you can towel dry them, throw them in a dryer for a bit until damp, etc. After drying you can brush with a suede brush. A rubber eraser can help get rid of watermarks if god forbid they happen. If you're still paranoid, don't listen to me lol. (EDIT: Don't do it with your $100 suede jacket or my conscience will kill me if anything happens. I'm pretty sure non-suede leather can be washed.)\n\nAll my thrifted clothes go through these washing procedures first. Then I air dry everything. After they're dried, I bury my nose in them and take a deep breath and if I detect a smell, I'll draw out the big guns below:\n\n1-- Oxiclean/sodium percarbonate soak overnight: This works for whites/bright non-protein fibers. The oxiclean kills the odor bacteria. Wash again afterward.\n\n2-- Laundry sanitizer soak for 20 mins: I use Lysol laundry sanitizer. Works the same as oxiclean but a bit more color-friendly. More expensive than oxiclean. Wash again afterward.\n\n3-- For silk and wool: Tbh I've never come across very smelly silk. The DL soak takes care of things very well. If there's a bit of lingering smell I soak in water and vinegar and hang dry again. For silk, I may use alcohol instead of vinegar. I'm not fond of alcohol on wool because the alcohol does strip the lanolin a bit.\n\nPeople would also suggest vodka spray to kill bacteria and swear on it as an old theater trick.  I'm sorry to inform that's not entirely true. Between theater folks and science, I'd go with the latter. And besides, I don't view theater clothes as the standard for cleanliness lol. Vodka simply doesn't contain enough alcohol to kill bacteria. It does bring along the odor when it eveporates so the clothes are less smelly. In this way it works similar to vinegar.\n\n4-- Steaming after drying can help get rid of the very last lingering smell.\n\nUsually I'm able to get rid of most smells with these methods. But mothball smell is probably still there. And sometimes the vintage smell is so ingrained in the fiber even when bacteria are gone. Time for even bigger guns:\n\n5-- Most simple method: Hang the clothes in a space with airflow. It will take a week, a month, a year, but the smell will go away. I was able to fade 50% the perfume smell on a wool cardigan after a year!!! Nothing worked on that cardigan, except time and air. Same with a funky vintage linen skirt, which took 2 months. Tbh, this is the only thing guaranteed to work lmao. Even the bigger guns below can't compare lol.\n\n6-- Cat litters: Bury your clothes in cat litter (the unused kind) or bentonite clay. It takes forever like the airflow method but it works.\n\n7-- Zero Odor Pro Pray: Can be found on amazon. It's a patented odor eliminating formula. It's a bit expensive, but it works, and I recommend having it in your home not just for clothes but for anything you want to deodorize. I spray it generously on to both sides of the clothes, and let dry. Then wash again. Zero Odor also has a laundry formula which you use in the machine. I don't find the laundry formula very effective tbh.\n\nZOP not 100% safe on protein fibers. It has a very high pH and will degrade them a bit. It's a tradeoff one has to accept. Most clothes cleaning products have high ph. With that being said, my vintage wool sweaters are holding up very well. Think of it as just normal wear and tear.\n\nAnother spray you can use is Nok-Out. It works by oxidizing the smells. Same precaution as ZOP. These sprays will get rid of mothball smells.\n\n8-- Ozone generator: This will get rid of 99.9% of smells. Cigarettes, mothballs, funks, etc. You'd have to accept that it will degrade protein fibers a bit, and it's dangerous to inhale ozone. I put the clothes and a small generator in a loosely closed box and leave it somewhere with airflow (my balcony) for 1-2 hours.\n\nNow after all these steps, probably 0.001% of the times there remains one final smell boss that refuses to die, for example my perfume cardigan. Thank God it's not a gross smell by any means. The smell has faded with time, airflow, and me wearing it.\n\nWe all love vintage and thrifted clothes, but smells can be offputting. I've seen youtuber with unwashed thrifted clothes with tags in their closets. To each their own but if you want your thrifted clothes to be as clean as your store-bought clothes, there are ways. I was confused a lot of the time when I did the research, so I hope this post help.",

I agree that dry cleaning (unless you can find the 1%, who Very Good and prohbitively expensive) is not ideal, and can be tough on a lot of vintage. I do pro clean outerwear/leather/lined and structured garments.\n\nAlcohol may kill some smells, but doesn't clean anything. If you can rent or know someone with an ozone generator, that's a good option, but you still need to clean most garments.\n\nI try to use only ph neutral laundry products if I'm washing (Orvus is good, and there are a lot of other products that work - just check the ph first). For most clothes I hand wash and dry flat or sometimes hang dry. I don't have a reliable delicate cycle on my washer, so I only machine wash things like jeans or very sturdy clothes.\n\nafaik, ANY enzyme product (or anything that goes too far out of the neutral ph range) can damage protein fibres. Yes, sometimes I need to wash several times to defeat a lingering odour, but I'm fine erring on the side of caution. If all else fails, blue Dawn will usually kill that last mothball or thrift-febreze smell.\n\nI really wouldn't 'bake' wool - it's like using hot hair dryers or curling irons. Washing properly will get rid of most 'insect remains'. Sure, if you buy a bunch of stuff at an estate sale, maybe be really careful, but I buy A LOT of woolens and I've never had a problem. The freezing treatment is: freeze for 2-3 days, keep at room temp for 1 day (isolated) and freeze for 2-3 days - I'd use this for lined or unwashable garments.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans‚Äô Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It‚Äôs not that ingredients in these are unsafe ‚Äì it‚Äôs the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- ‚ÄúCosmeceutical‚Äù\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA‚Äôs Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body‚Äôs total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20‚Äì30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

Vet is coming out again soon to speak further, but I‚Äôm reaching out here to gather others‚Äô experiences.\nHas anyone successfully mitigated extreme sweet itch? And, if so, HOW?\nHere‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done:\nAllergy testing Summer of 2023 / showed allergies to corn, soy, rice, bug saliva and some grasses not in our area.\nStarted allergy injections September 2023. They helped A LOT through the winter! She grew a tail and didn‚Äôt have any open wounds from scratching.\nBy March, she was beginning to scratch again. (We are in Pennsylvania, USA)\nUsing steroid cream from vet on the worst areas, but honestly, it does nothing.\nApril, added 11 tablets of Zyrtec at each of 2 feedings.\nMay, removed any allergen grains from her diet. And got her a Snuggyhood to help with the belly itching.\nEnd of May, right now, Snuggy hood has 3 holes in it. She has open wounds daily from scratching on her shed and the one tree in the pasture. She is so distracted that I‚Äôm not riding her or even really working with her because she can barely go 15‚Äô before she has to scratch something with her teeth. The top of her front legs are hairless and the skin is rough and angry. Her ears are usually wounded as is her neck and tail. I go back and forth between the steroid cream, a steroid spray, a bentonite clay paste to help dry the wounds and swat.\nI need answers and other options because she is miserable and nothing we‚Äôve done helps at all.

        "body": "There's a harmless test to determine whether or not this horse is infested with *Onchocerca cervicalis. (neck threadworm.)* Ask your vet, or just use the standard treatment to determine whether or not threadworms are present. Dose with two tubes of Ivermectin/pamoate. Wait ten days and dose with two tubes again. The horse may be extra itchy right after the first dose, as that drives the juvenile worms down to the belly line to die, at which point biting midges gnaw on the skin, causing the allergic flareup. BUT, after that phase, you will see a tremendous calming of symptoms if indeed neck threadworm is the root of this.  If the sweet itch doesn't improve dramatically, you don't have a threadworm infestation.\n\nYou can't kill the adult threadworms in the nuchal ligament, and they live ten years. You can control the juvenile worms and the belly and neck itching with this treatment, repeated as needed. Eventually the adult worms will die off, too. When you have the juveniles under control, bug spray and skin salves will work much better and the hair will grow back, including mane and tail. \n\nThe source for sweet itch can be this vicious worm-open itchy wound-biting midge feeding-allergic reaction cycle. The threadworms once were just present in semi tropical areas, but with climate change, they are moving both north and south. They are now showing up in Washington State. \n\nI have to live with this in my PRE mare. Thankfully, she's good with paste worming. I minimize the treatment and only  re-treat when she starts to rub her mane out. Treatment is effective in about 24 hours, for her.",

        "body": "This is something I posted some time back about a battle with sweet itch \n\nThis is my experience and what worked for me.\n\nGnats (midges, no-see-ums, etc.) cause an allergic reaction in some horses.  Areas commonly affected are mane, belly, tail, lower legs.  This is the nature of the gnats feeding.\n\nGnats are most active during daylight hours.  They are tiny, and can squeeze through any type of screen.  They aren't affected by fly spray and are attracted, like mosquitoes, to exhaled CO2.  In some suspectable individuals, even a small number of bites are enough to set up a systemic response. I never once found a fabric barrier like fly boots or rugs of any kind to be effective. There were no feed additive that had the slightest effect.. trust me, if it could be ground up, turned to a paste, gotten into a ponies digestive tract in any way, I probably tried it.  I tried antihistamine granuals from my vet as well, with zero results.\n\nWhat we warriors have going for us..  gnats have a super short proboscis, and can't penetrate very deeply, and can't get through an oily coating (shapley's MTG was a miracle..  it's oily, soothing, and lasts.. very irritating to thin skinned areas, alas).  Gnats are weak flyers and have to have relatively still air to hit their target.  \n\nThat said..  I was able to build nearly air tight stalls for these two ponies, with double fans in each.  They were out at night, only.  It was only during gnat season... But it has to be strict, as they were both hypersensitive.  One slip up, and they would need steroid injections in order to tolerate normal care.  Once the itch started they were nearly frantic to find something to itch on.\n\nGood luck!",

Though I'm still struggling with my bacne since like 5 years and have a long way to go but thanks to the recent before after bacne post I'm still hopeful:) Thankyou cuties‚ú®\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I hope it's not as blurry as it looks on the laptop lol](https://preview.redd.it/2oswmpqqjed71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=466345c5fc671a55da7bbd5cbf628ecf3a25838f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent routine: **AM**\\- *Splash water>PHA toner>Minimalist Vit C>ponds gel moisturizer>Uv doux*\n\n**PM**\\-*Khadi mauri ubtan facewash(not pictured)>PC bha>ponds gel.* Boroline on lips and eyelids. TO glycolic at pm once a week. Nature tattva bentonite clay once every other week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Vitamin C**\n\nPrice: 660/- at amazon\n\nInitially I felt it made my skin oily, toned it down to 2 drops on face, and few for neck. Didn't sting my eyes which is a major plus point. Usually whenever I'd do skincare my face would look good but by evening it'd turn dull. Once I started with this the glow was maintained throughout the day. I didn't expect it to lighten my eye area but gradually it did feel like the tone was evening out slightly.  Not that anyone cares but my fucking cat broke the bottle which is why I didn't mention it in my current routine(edit: ok I added it nvm-.-), thankfully it was almost over. **Maybe WRP** coz I want to explore k/jbeauty vit C range. Overall *9/10* coz I still dislike the slight oily feel it gives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TO niacinamide 10% + zn**\n\nPurchased from cult beauty along w a few other stuff so not sure how to pinpoint the price\n\nI loved the texture and it absorbed well. But it irritated my skin. Stung my eyes. I realised this late when I stopped using it and noticed the occasional bumps on skin were gone. I definitely should've started w a lower concentration it's my mistake but now I run away even hearing the name. *0/10* Big fat NO for me. **WNRP.**\n\nEdit: I had to give the ingredient another try so currently using the minimalist niacinamide and it's working well for me. Maybe it's the difference in formulation? Idk.\n\n**Natura tattva bentonite clay AND Innisfree volcanic cluster**\n\nPrice: Nature tattva 200/- for 250g at amazon, Innisfree volcanic clay 150/- for 10ml at nykaa.\n\nBoth are decent. Innisfree has this smooth texture of thick paint. I liked nature tattva more coz I felt it cleaned my face much better and compared to innisfree this was stronger(in an effective way) and it didn't completely dry my face too. I use it once in a week or two weeks. **WRP** Nature tattva *9/10* it does what is expected so. Innisfree 7/10 not effective enough for my oily areas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ponds super light gel moisturizer**\n\nPrice: got it for 185/- at bigbasket(147g)\n\nThis one is a blessing for combo skin, a tad bit goes a long way. It's so affordable with good quantity like I've been using it for 3months and there's still like 60% of it. Initially I couldn't handle the amount of flowery fragrance, but now I've somehow adjusted to it. And am also not a fan of the packaging but overall I love this product. **WRP** and will give it a 9.5/10.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Simple hydrating light moisturizer**\n\nPrice: 350/- at nykaa\n\nMy ex had gifted me 2 bottles after I'd whine about seeing all the rave reviews in the sub and that it was always out of stock. I thought it'd be perfect for my skin type but sadly it irritated me and gave me whiteheads. I hate it and I use it on my hands and legs. I had similar experience with *physiogel* it gave me ccs' on forehead within a day. **WNRP** no no *0/10*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vaseline aloe fresh lotion**\n\nPrice: 250/- at bigbasket\n\nOk a lot of people I know use it. It's a bit runny and the cooling affect it gives is da bomb. Moisturizing is ok, which is why it's better for summer. But I have my doubts that it triggered my bacne back so I hate it. My thighs and arms also felt itchy at times whenever I'd use it. 10/10 for cooling but -100/10 for bacne prone people. **WNEVERRP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vaseline derma care Advanced repair body lotion**\n\nPrice: 270/- at bigbasket( I'm addicted to bigbasket lol)\n\nI really really really really love this one. It's creamy compared to the aloe one. My feet had dry patches here and there since forever and over the time it's become smooth. I love the way it moisturizes and this is my second bottle and the quantity is a steal for the price. Though it'd feel bit heavy on summer but after I tried the aloe varient and that backfired I had to come back to this lol.  I use very little to lather on whole the damp body. *100/10* \\***WRP till I die**\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist tranexamic acid**\n\nPrice: Pre-ordered for 490/- with coupon from their site.\n\nWhen I started using it, to my face it felt like any face oil lol it just wasn't getting absorbed well. The team had advised to use it on dry skin. I started using on slightly damp skin, much better. But honestly it did nothing for my pie or pih. I used it for about 1.5months. Absolutely nothing. *meh/10* **WNRP.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% bha**\n\nPrice: 900/- at Amazon for 30ml\n\nOk so I had got this for my blackheads, and it has lowered it down appearance-wise it's not really gone much. But I fucking love it I don't know how to explain, my skin looks so much idk cleaner? And ever since I started this I've been pimple/bump/whitehead free! It's been 2months and as someone who occasionally gets something popping up I'm so happy with this product. Even my period breakouts are in control like I used to get 2-3 boils on face but now it's either none or 1 smallone(well I'm not sure it could be hormones too but just felt like pointing out). I don't wake up with a super oily face in the morning like before anymore. *100/10* **WRP till I die**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Aziderm 20% gel** (edit: **Prescription** product)\n\nThe absolute game changer. I owe my life to this one. It did wonders for my skin, I could see some changes within a week and gradually it cleared my whole face out. I used 20% right away coz I had used exazel N (OTC and also 20% aza) previously but had found it difficult to blend it so switched to this one. It works for both active pimples and pih?? I fucking love this product that's all. 1000/10 **WRP** if I break out in future coz now I know my skin loves aZa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist pha 3% toner**\n\nPrice: 390/- on their website\n\nThis was my first toner so I don't have anything to compare it with but I like it. So it's really hard to find a decent moisturizer for combo skin, to find something that's not too oily, not too drying. The lighter ones would loose the affect and after a while my cheeks would feel stretchy. The ponds super light gel is a light moisturizer, but paired w this toner's hydration it's doing great. Also the pricing is a steal for the quantity. 9/10 **\\*WRP\\***\n\nI fucking hate their customer service though. I had bought this and tranexamic and it was supposed to be a valentine gift for me(by me lol). But they use delhivery and it took more than two weeks to reach. I used to chat with them occasionally and it's so funny the same day [they said this](https://imgur.com/a/8FVOV0h) they seenzoned and then later never opened my chat. Will only buy from Amazon from now on coz I spent my V-day with no new skincare ughhh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mcaffeine coffee body scrub and Coffee body lotion**\n\nThis was gifted and it was a pleasant experience. The scrub isn't in the picture it's over so I just diy it now. The scrub made my body feel so smooth. And the lotion has this perfumy fragrance that I don't mind and quite like it adds to the experience, I use it right after washing off the scrub. Whenever am low and depressed I pamper myself w these. Smooth and perfumy body I'll definitely use this before I get laid for the first time teehee(>.<). *8/10* just for pamper sessions. **Maybe WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TO glycolic acid 7% toning solution**\n\nPrice: I got this from ~~koreanbeautyindia~~(EDIT: SORRY GUYS IT's [koreanskincareindia](https://www.instagram.com/koreanskincareindia/)) on ig for 1475/-, all the other pages were out of stock so I'm not sure if this is the best price but it has been worth it for me\n\nI've been using it for more than three weeks. So I ALWAYS had issues with my(like I said, elephant) body textures at certain places. I'm gonna make a list coz I've seen so many changes\n\n\\-rough textured dry patches on my front neck and collar-bone region is gone\n\n\\-dark patchy nape(back of neck) that no amount of moisturizer scrubbing helped which has been there since forever. Now it's all smooth and the darkness has reduced tremendously I couldn't fucking believe it???\n\n\\-My elbow area was quite dark lately and had bumps coz of my constant itching along with some kp towards my lower arm, now the darkness has drastically reduced, no bumps and it's so smooth??\n\n\\-KP on my butt and rough patches are gone and it's become a baby's butt now. Moisturex with urea had helped me similarly with kp but the quantity was annoying for me I'd have to keep repurchasing I've so many empty tubs lying around it's a lot of wastage. This is a better investment in my opinion and lasts so long.\n\n\\-I had read on international subs by people of color that it did wonders for their underarm pigmentation, and I can see it working it's definitely improved. Glyco-6 also had worked well there for me in the past.\n\nIt hurts like a bitch on mosquito bites or any other idk similar areas so you've to be careful lol.\n\nLately I've been touching my shoulders, neck, upper arms, elbows, butt which I never did but rn I love how soft and different they feel and my mood lifts up hehe. I also believe the Vaseline lotion did it's bit so am glad I've found a perfect combo for my body. *1000/10* Abso-freakin-lutely **WRP even in my afterlife.**\n\nEdit: You guys the lotion has equal credits for all the parts where I've written smooth oküíÄ\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ipca Acne-OC oil control moisturizer**\n\nPrice: 440/- for 75g at pharmeasy. I've noticed they keep increasing it's price\n\nI like it. This is my second tube, but now that I found the ponds gel I'm saving this one for winters. It felt soothing and didn't make my face look oily or anything, doesn't sting my eyes, overall a good moisturizer. Their sunscreen pill like crazy though. *9/10* **Maybe WRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Uv-doux spf 50+**\n\nPrice: Got it w some coupon at 1mg for 870/-(100g)\n\nI love it. The matte and silicony finish works well for my oily parts and for someone who doesn't wear makeup. It doesn't sting my eyes. I went to beach once wearing it and usually my face would either become a tomato or dull, but it didn't happen. I'm not sure about how cakey it would feel while reapplication since I've been only using it mostly at home and don't re-apply. And it's weird but the 100g one has a mousse/truffle filling like texture, whereas the 50g was a bit more stiff like it'd come as a cylinder, might be the difference w the opening:p Overall I like it. *10/10* **\\*Maybe RP\\*** idk I've yet to figure out the re-application part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Neutrogena ultra sheer spf 50+**\n\nPrice: 520/- at nykaa\n\nI really loved the application, it absorbed well. Though some whitecast it dissapears after a while. BUT it stung my eyes like CRAZY arrrgh it was a nightmare so **WNRP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tret 0.05 and glocin(clindamycin & nicotinamide) gel**\n\n**PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS** that is working well on my bacne currently. I've had bacne before but the aloe lotion made my back broke out like never before. I use tret and the TO glycolic together at night. I've been using these for 20days and I can say around 20% of it is reduced which is a lot in such a short time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sudocrem**\n\nPrice: 525/- at Amazon\n\nSo this was pretty much raved about in all the international skincare subs and how it is a staple and is present in everyone's house(like vaseline for us). A lot of people there said their bacne vanished after using this. It's whitecast is like white paint for clown makeup coz of the zinc, you've to give a good amount of time for it to settle in, until then you keep massaging till your hand hurts:) I should say I did see a few of my lighter pihs fading, but I gave up coz the application was tiring. It's a meh product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Khadi mauri ubtan face wash(not pictured)**\n\nMy mom got big bottles of it in an exhibition and am just finishing it up for now. It's a decent face wash, it's very velvety creamy smooth in texture, foams up decently. It doesn't dry out my face. *8/10.* I am not picky on face washes and haven't explored much coz I never wore makeup so I just use whatever mom buys like himalaya/joy and all and they all seem same to me it does what it's expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed foaming cleanser AND Cetaphil gentle cleanser(not pictured)**\n\nI abolutely hate the sebamed foaming cleanser. It used to make my skin tingly but ofcourse my dumbass thought it means it's working. Also a lot of people/influencers have called them out that it's actual ph is way higher than what they market it to be. Maybe that's why. I also stopped using their clear gel after that.I had bought Cetaphil gentle one for morning cleanser, ik it sounds insane but for some reason it felt like my pores grew bigger, and also felt the blackheads started becoming more visible. *0/10*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be surprised if someone read this far;\\_;gee thanks.",

    "body": "I used to be the kind of person who tried a ton of new skincare stuff because it was fun or smelled nice or came in pretty packaging until I realized that was causing the majority of my acne. So for the past several years I haven't really tried much new in my routine because my skin is sensitive and fairly reactive. I don't enjoy running around with acne or the feeling of covering itchy/irritated skin with foundation. With the stay-at-home order, I had the benefits of trying a lot of new stuff since no one was going to see my face besides my family and my zoom buddies. So that's what I did, and I love reading reviews, so I figured it was a good time to write some.\n\nI tried all the products separately from one another. If a product irritated my skin or caused a break out I gave myself a week for my skin to calm down before trying a new product. I have tried to list the prices from places that I know are common across the states (sorry out of the US, I'm not sure what stores you guys have) like Walmart, Target, Ulta, Sephora etc. I will be rating out of 5 stars.\n\nI tend to prefer cheaper, drugstore options to more expensive ones, but I can sometimes justify it for things with pretty packaging or that make me feel fancy.\n\n**Skin info**: 28F, very pale/easily sunburn, dry, sensitive/reactive skin, prone to hormonal acne and clogged pores\n\n**Skin concerns**: aging, hydration, whiteheads, papules/pustules, a fair amount of PIH and PIE\n\n**Fair warning:** My vendetta against fragrance is righteous and unrestrained. I don't mind so much if products have ingredients that are there solely for the purpose of fragrance but they need to TELL ME what it is so I know if it's what's causing me an issue instead of just listing \"fragrance\" on the label.\n\n**Sunscreen**\n\n*  **Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30** ($10.99 for 3oz at Target) - 1 star. I hate this sunscreen. It was what I always used as a teen when I went to the beach, because it was the only face-specific drugstore option available to me. I repurchased because I haven't been using a sunscreen regularly and know how important it is, and I knew I had used it before. And wow, it reminded me why I hated putting sunscreen on my face so much. It smells so strongly with that chemical sunscreen scent, and it's right by your nose, so it is offensive and lasts a while. I suffer from chronic migraines, and scent is a common irritant and/or trigger for me, so this was extra awful. It‚Äôs thick. It‚Äôs sticky. It doesn‚Äôt wear well under makeup. It burns my face and eyes when I put it on, and then when I take it off it burns even more! It didn‚Äôt cause any breakouts to my knowledge, but I didn‚Äôt try it very long, so that is really left to be seen. I will not be repurchasing. \n*  **Sun Bum Mineral Face Stick SPF 50** ($11.99 for 0.45oz at Target) - 1 star. I picked this up to try a mineral face sunscreen. I was hoping that a mineral sunscreen would be better smell-wise. I also thought the stick idea was genius, because it fits in my purse so easily, and I knew it would not accidentally open up and squirt everywhere (am I the only one this happens to?). Unfortunately, the stick formula is hard to work with, and I found dragging it across my skin was way too harsh. So I used it by rubbing it on my hands and then into my face, but in general it was thick, difficult to work with, and did not want to rub in. It left a visible white cast on my face, despite me being one of the palest people I know. It also caused me some breakouts. It does wear well under makeup, but that may be the only positive I found. I will not be repurchasing this.\n* **Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF50+ PA++++** ($14.90 for 3oz on Amazon) - 4.5 stars. I love this sunscreen! It feels like a thick face lotion instead of being kind of goopy the way sunscreen typically does. It also lacks that typical sunscreen smell. It has a bit of an alcohol scent when it first comes out, but the smell dissipates very quickly. It doesn‚Äôt cause any issues under my makeup, and it hasn‚Äôt broken me out so far. I don‚Äôt notice a white cast, but I‚Äôm extremely pale, so take that with a grain of salt. It does have fragrance listed under ingredients, which I‚Äôm not super excited about, but otherwise is absolutely perfect. This is the first sunscreen that I've actually used every morning since trying instead of making excuses about why I don‚Äôt need it. I will most definitely be repurchasing.\n* I wanted to try some of the options from La Roche Posay, but considering Biore works so well for me and is considerably more affordable, I don't see myself purchasing them. I do, however, really want to try Supergoop Glowscreen because I love a good glow, and I could see myself using that on it's own in the summer for a light look, but it's also quite pricey, so it may be something I save for or ask for birthday/Christmas.\n\n**Cleansing Balms**\n\n* **Ponds Makeup Remover Cleansing Balm** ($9.99 for 3.38oz at Walmart) 3.5 stars. I had high hopes for this as a cheap cleansing balm that wasn't based off coconut oil (breaks me out real bad). It did the job just fine, but it took more rubbing than I'm used to from a cleansing balm. It just felt... lackluster? I'm not sure. It also had fragrance listed as an ingredient, which is annoying. I'm not planning on repurchasing.\n* **Banila‚Äå ‚ÄåCo‚Äå ‚ÄåClean‚Äå ‚Äåit‚Äå ‚ÄåZero‚Äå ‚ÄåOriginal‚Äå ‚ÄåCleansing‚Äå ‚ÄåBalm‚Äå‚Äå** ‚Äå($26‚Äå ‚Äåfor‚Äå ‚Äå6oz‚Äå ‚Äåon‚Äå ‚ÄåAmazon or $19 for 3.3oz at Ulta)‚Äå  4 stars. I like this product, but I‚Äôm not married to it. It‚Äôs got that typical cleansing balm texture, where it sort of turns to an oil on your face as you rub it into water. It took all of my makeup and sunscreen off quickly and easily without stinging my eyes. The smell is, in my opinion, offensive, and is labeled ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù on the ingredients so no idea what it is. It‚Äôs a very perfume-y scent. I‚Äôm interested in trying some of the other versions to see if they smell better/different. I really love the packaging. It‚Äôs a matte pink and comes with a little spatula AND spatula holder. Genius. Every tub based product needs to have this. I haven‚Äôt experienced any breakouts from this, but I also use it as part of a double cleanse, so it isn‚Äôt left on my face for much time. I will be repurchasing this unless I see/hear of a better but still cheap alternative.\n* I have tried and loved Clinique Take the Day off but can't really justify spending that kind of money when it's not any better than the Banila Co. I am interested in trying other stuff, but almost all of the cheap options include fracking coconut oil, and I just can't justify the more expensive options when it's just a makeup remover.\n\n**Moisturizers**\n\n* **Vanicream Moisturizing Cream** ($13.49 for 16oz at Target) - 3 stars. I liked this in theory because there were so few ingredients. I figured nothing in this could possibly break out or irritate my skin, since it‚Äôs basically petroleum and water. And I was right! Unfortunately, it just wasn‚Äôt nearly moisturizing enough for my skin. It also has a kind of sour, unpleasant smell (I recognize my hypocrisy after complaining about fragrance in everything else, but like... it smells like spoiled milk, ew). I will continue using this on my body over other moisturizers to help seal in the moisture until it runs out, but I will not be repurchasing.\n* **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream** ($18.49 for 16oz at Target) - 3.5 stars. I wanted to like this, based on so many positive skincareaddiction reviews. I switched to this from the CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (which I‚Äôve been using almost 10 years now) because I needed extra moisture during the winter. For reasons I‚Äôm still trying to sort out, this broke me out, but the daily moisturizing lotion does not. I did an in depth look at the ingredients and found them to be almost exactly identical except for the cream having different ceramides and including petroleum and tocopherol where the lotion did not. Now the ceramides I‚Äôm not too worried about, and I already know that petroleum isn‚Äôt a problem for me, and tocopherol is in TO Azelaic Acid which I love and adore. I don‚Äôt entirely understand it, but I don‚Äôt make the rules, my skin does. I will continue using this on my body and will repurchase when it goes on sale because it‚Äôs so hard to find unscented products for my migraine days, and this is an excellent body moisturizer.\n* **Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel** ($7.99 for 0.5oz trial size or $16.99 for 1.7oz at Target)- 3 stars. Glad I got the trial size, though it lasted barely a week. Another skincareaddiction favorite that just didn‚Äôt work for me. I was so hopeful for this. While I didn‚Äôt see any breakouts in the few days I tried it, it just wasn‚Äôt hydrating enough for me. I kept adding more and more throughout the day. My skin is very, very dry, and I felt it getting tighter and rougher very quickly. I didn‚Äôt push it further, because my skin was so desperate for moisture. I also didn‚Äôt love that there was fragrance in the mini tub I got, but I read online that there is a fragrance-free option, so I'm not too mad. I used up my mini tub and will not be repurchasing, though I do still recommend it to my friends with more combination or oily skin.\n* **CeraVe Healing Ointment tube version** ($9.99 for 3oz at Target) - 5 stars. I used to use vaseline or aquaphor on my easily chapped lips at night, and I didn't really think there was anything out there that was better. But wow this is SO much better. My chapped lips LOVE this stuff. It‚Äôs still got that petroleum feel where it‚Äôs kind of slimy/goopy but honestly by morning it has sunk in unlike vaseline/aquaphor which are still there feeling filmy and gross in the morning. I feel like this may also be a game changer come cold and flu season to use around my nose, because I get the worse chapped skin around my nose when I‚Äôm sick. I will be repurchasing this and am currently seeking out the mini versions for my purse.\n\n**Acne Solutions**\n\n* **Adult Acnomel** ($11.99 for 1.3oz at Walmart)- 2 stars. I was intrigued by this because it was an acne medication without benzoyl peroxide, which tends to dry out my skin, even as a spot treatment. It has resorcinol and sulfur as its active ingredients, along with bentonite clay. It did help slightly when used as a spot treatment, but it also irritated my skin and left little red, irritation circles. I‚Äôm not surprised, as when I checked, I saw it has alcohol listed as the first inactive ingredient. Another star off for listing fragrance, because why would a spot treatment require fragrance?! I will not be repurchasing this.\n* **Stridex Sensitive with Aloe 0.5% Salicylic Acid pads** ($3.97 for a box of 90 at Walmart) - 4 stars. I appreciate that they have a low salicylic acid version and especially that these are alcohol free. In high school I was a huge user of alcohol based acne pads and was pretty badly turned off to acne pads, but these are definitely changing my mind. I still had to start by using them every other day to avoid the initial drying period, and I‚Äôm hoping to eventually graduate to using the regular strength. It has made a difference in clogged pores, especially on my chin. I would give this 5 stars but they have FRAGRANCE listed on their ingredients. In a SENSITIVE skin version. So frustrating, honestly. I will still be repurchasing, though.\n* **The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%** ($7.90 for 1oz at Ulta) - 4 stars - This is a product I will probably never stop using. Nothing has made more of a difference in my inflammatory acne than this product. I ran out and didn't repurchase sometime before the pandemic and was seeing a lot of papules and pustules. I got some more of this with the rest of my skincare order, and maybe a week after I reintroduced it was seeing a huge reduction in acne. I can‚Äôt give it 5 stars because it honestly pills something FIERCE under makeup or if other products are layered. The only other azelaic acid product on the market I‚Äôve seen is the Paula‚Äôs Choice version, and I just can‚Äôt justify spending 3x what I spend on this, even if it doesn't have the pilling issue. If there are any other suggestions for better Azelaic Acid products that are affordable, let me know. Otherwise, I will be repurchasing this until the end of time. \n\n**Other stuff**\n\n* **The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% in Squalane** ($9.60 for 1oz at TO website) - 4 stars. This is another product that I‚Äôm not particularly married to. I can‚Äôt really tell if it‚Äôs doing anything, but I‚Äôm going to continue using it because I‚Äôm terrified of aging. I have pretty deep wrinkles in my forehead, but they‚Äôve been there literally since I was 20. I have very expressive eyebrows, and that‚Äôs just not gonna change. I‚Äôve heard that these newer retinoids aren‚Äôt as well studied as other types of retinol, but honestly this gave me no irritation, and that‚Äôs so important to me. If, in the future, evidence comes out that these don't work or work less than other types of retinol, I may make the switch. Until then, catch me rocking some irritation-free and hypothetically less-aged skin. I‚Äôve actually already repurchased this for when it runs out, but in the 5% version because more has to be better, right?\n* **Glow Recipe Avocado Melt Retinol Eye Sleeping Mask** ($42 for 0.5oz at Sephora) - 3 stars. I got this as a free sample. I don‚Äôt normally do eye creams, because I think they‚Äôre kind of over-priced moisturizers, but I figured a retinol one might be useful because obviously I don‚Äôt put my regular retinol near my eyes. I haven‚Äôt really noticed a difference in my eye area from this product, though obviously as an anti-aging mask it would be more preventative. The packaging I saw online is super cute, and I do feel kind of boujee putting it on, so I thought it might be a cute self-care purchase even if it isn‚Äôt doing all that much. And then I saw the price tag. Hot damn $42 for 0.5oz? For that much money I better wake up looking like a model in a coffee commercial. AND I found out there is fragrance listed as one of the ingredients. I do not need fragrance near my eyes, thank you, next. I will not be repurchasing. But let a girl know if there's a decent (and cheap) retinol/anti-aging eye cream.\n* **Glow Recipe Watermelon + AHA Glow Sleeping Mask** ($45 for 2.7oz at Sephora) - 4 stars. I bought this in a travel size to try, and I hoped I would see some results from the AHA. It didn‚Äôt list the percentage, so I assume it‚Äôs fairly low. My skin feels so soft and smooth and hydrated and honestly just wonderful in the morning after using this, and it hasn‚Äôt caused any breakouts or irritation. I also feel like the whiteheads on my forehead have lessened as a result of this. It doesn‚Äôt exactly sink in the way it claims, and definitely needs to be rinsed off in the morning or it will pill under other products/makeup/sunscreen. It unfortunately has fragrance listed as an ingredient, and smells like watermelon candy. Whenever I put it on, I am transported to being 11 years old and using those roller-ball lip glosses from lipsmacker. The packaging is absolutely adorable, and I just really love the way it looks on my shelf. I will not be repurchasing at this time, though I may ask for it for my birthday or Christmas or save it for a special self-care-gift-to-myself, because it's so pretty and makes me feel fancy and actually does something for me.\n\nThanks for reading til the end. I hope this was useful to someone. I've got some more products on the way, and am currently still testing some, so if this review was helpful at all, let me know, and I'll make another post for those products when my testing is finished. Testing all these new products has been a really fun pandemic activity for me to keep me from going insane while trapped in the house.",

        "body": "I got a little curious and dove a bit into your post history to see if you posted more info! This might be a bit longer\n\nFirst about the hiatal hernia: most are small and don't need surgical intervention but it might exacerbate symptoms of reflux (by weakening lower esophaegic sphincter), chest pressure (flutters, breath shortness) and might even press on the vagus nerve (which can mess with your heart rhythm, digestion and even mood).\nEspecially in combination with GERD and anxiety it *might* be symptom triggering.\n\nHave you checked your thyroid levels? (TSH, T3, T4)\nBecause hyperthyroidism can mimic PVC, anxiety and sweating as well. More hunger, heart pounding, heat sensitivity etc etc.\n\nHave you checked for Dysautonomia? Otherwise all symptoms together might indicate a chronic stress/HPA axis dysregulation.\n\nDo you suffer from some form of trauma in your life? Stress is one of the most powerful factors in our health. It's difficult to say at this distance what is connected to what, but if you have the suspicion you might be impacted it will be good to check (if you haven't already). An overactive nervous system can, with time, react disproportionally strong. I think there was something developed called \"neurofeedback\" or \"biofeedback\" where your vitals and brain waves can be measured to see how your brain and body work with stress.\n\nDo you have any jaw pain? Clicking, blockages etc.\nOur body is quite the delicate system! And usually when we feel stress it goes there first. TMJ can cause GERD, back and shoulder pain, headaches and quite some other things people don't directly connect with it. TMJ is super easy to take care of as well, you just need a few sessions to fix it.\n\nNow finally about the body odor directly! Since it was there since your teenage years, it sounds more metabolic or endocrine (as opposed to current meds/anxiety).\n\n1) it could be genetics of course (apocrine bromhidrosis)\n2) Trimethylaminauria (TMAU): a pretty rare disorder that causes a strong fishy odor (body can't break down Trimethyla.) -> again, uncommon? But might be worth checking out if the smell persists\n3) sulfur-processing issues (diet/metabolism) might cause this\n4) high androgen levels (testosterone) can increase smell even in women\n5) mild hormonal imbalance or PCOS could be considered (other signs: with acne, irregular periods)\n6) gut imbalance\n7) steroid inhalers might indirectly affect it over time\n\nYou could try:\n- antiperspirants with clinical strength\n- probiotics \n- zinc supplements\n\nIMPORTANT: please of course talk to a healthcare provider before taking any new supplements. Even zinc or probiotics might not be good for everyone. Especially if you have cardiac concerns.\n\nPantoprazole could lower zinc: something that most people are already deficient in. Zinc is insanely useful for the immune system, since I started taking it I didn't have any herpes outbreaks anymore!\n\nBut: Zinc, magnesium, iron and calcium (and pantoprazole) all compete with each other for absorption, it might be useful to take them a bit apart. Zinc is good to take with food, might irritate your stomach.\nPantoprazole can also disrupt the gut flora a bit, that's where probiotics might be something to consider.\n\nI'm sorry, it got a bit longer. This is by no means any kind of diagnosis, you can do research on things that might help you. I'm sure you already went through quite a few tests. This reminds me of this joke... chronic/mental/physical disease is like a \"take 1 get 7 for free\" kind of offer. Weirdly true somehow. Good luck!!",

In the morning I put on spray deodorant/antiperspirant. If it's a really hot day or I'm going to the gym I reapply spray deodorant but on an average day I don't need to. I've tried it with a few different deodorants - clinical, non clinical, mens, sports etc, tbh I get the same results from them all so I just use a Dove one that I like the smell of (same scent for roll on and spray). I swear sleeping with the roll on lets it absorb so it doesn't rub off on my clothes, and then the spray top up in the morning just keeps me fresh. I think that's what has made the biggest difference!\n\nAlso editing to add that if I do get smelly during the day I wipe my pits with antibacterial wipes (they need to be antibacterial to kill the bacteria that's making you smell) and just reapply deodorant.

Number one is the benzoyl peroxide, but you MUST use it everyday or every other day if your skin is sensitive and 10 or 15% not the 5% stuff because (at least in my experience) you need the industrial strength stuff. You first should scrub your armpits with regular soap and a loofah to get off any deodorant then benzoyl peroxide for as long as you can honestly. More than 5 minutes is optimal especially when you‚Äôre starting out. I find that since I‚Äôve been using it for a long time I can go days without being crazy smelly!! Truly can‚Äôt tell you how happy I was finally not stinking everyday. The second thing is the degree clinical protection men‚Äôs advanced deodorant, it‚Äôs a dark green one. You need to apply this immediately after you shower. Dry your pits and deodorize. What‚Äôs important is that you‚Äôve killed the bacteria, now you need to prevent them from growing. I would honestly apply in the morning and at night, as an extra layer of protection. I also use an antibacterial wound spray from Walgreens, I find that this helps when I‚Äôm in a pinch and just need to kill the smell then deodorize but don‚Äôt have time for a shower. I think maybe you‚Äôre a bit smellier than me, I didn‚Äôt have problems with my clothes smelling post wash, but I truly tried everything. I would put rubbing alcohol on my pits to kill the bacteria, scrub with all kinds of soap, and get out of the shower still smelling like onions.

    "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been lurking on this sub for a while now, probably read upwards of thousands of posts, struggling to find an actual solution for my stubborn sebaceous filaments. When I mean stubborn, i really do mean STUBBORN! I should be studying for my exams right now and it is rare that I make a post, but i absolutely felt the need to share my results with you. Most people on this sub seem to have sebaceous filaments that are not really observable, small little black dots. However, for the few of us that have ridiculously oily skin, our filaments are more pronounced than others. When I mean pronounced, I really do mean that! You can see it from a meter away. I have struggled with acne and oily skin my entire life, and been researching the topic since I was 15, (22 now).\n\n**I believe that acne and textural irregularities (i.e pronounced filaments) have three different causes:**\n\n1. Hormones - not much you can do here other than to aggressively attack the acne if your a man or balance the hormones if ur a female. Accutane/Antibiotics/Birth Control if you are a female. I think there is other products out there for women if hormones are an issue but for men who struggle with hormonal acne, antibiotics > retinoid topicals > accutane is usually the recommended route by most dermatologists. I‚Äôve never heard of any method that seems to adress the imbalance of hormones for men. Imbalanced hormones might definitely lead to overactive sebaceous glands. \n2. Sebaceous Glands that are naturally more active - high sebum production - not much you can do here, a lot of people have this belief that dehydrated skin may cause more oiliness, but this is not true for some of us and no matter how much moisturizer we slather on, it only makes it look more oily! I'm currently trying to incorporate a high linoleic acid oil (i.e: Hemp) into my routine to see if I can get my oil production under control but this is another matter. There are some studies that Niacinimide/Zinc/L-Carnitine helping to address overactive sebaceous glands but its minimal. I don't think topicals have the power to slow down the activity of sebaceous glands, unless you have super dehydrated skin that is prone to oiliness. For the rest of us, the only other solution is low dow accutane 10 mg/week over an indefinite period of time. This is the dosage recommended by many dermatologists if u simply want to adress the oily skin. For reference: on my last accutane round, i was at 80mg/day for 4 months, that is the equivalent of 18 years of 10mg/week and its deemed safe for long term usage at such low doses but you should ask your dermatologist. You want to stay away from high vitamin b5 doses which can help oily skin but may cause hair loss. There are some anecdotal evidences of a Vitamin D deficiency also causing oily skin. If you rarely get any sun exposure and have super oily skin, you might want to get your levels tested and experiment with D3 pills in Cholecalciferol form.\n3. Skin that doesn't shed properly - This is so HUGE!!! . Have you ever seen some people with super oily skin but skin that is flawless? With this group of people, their sebum flows freely between their pores and from my understanding, doesn't lead to the accumulation/oxidization of oil, that eventually leads to acne. AHAs/BHAS/Retinoids help address this issue of improper shedding.\n\n**Cause of my rough nose and sebaceous filaments: 2 & 3.**\n\nThe issue that I had was my skin would get so oily, and then it would lead to gunky pores, very rough to the touch, especially my nose! as the sebaceous glands here are the largest and most active.  It became so bad that my filaments became these white strands (1/4 inch), and i literally had hundreds on my nose, especially in the crease area. I resorted to charcoal peel off masks to keep it under control but they would just fill up the next day and I don't think peel off masks are good for your skin. Here is a good picture I found on Google that slightly resembles what I had: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwUsYY6Wgt4/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QwUsYY6Wgt4/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n**So here is what worked for me!**\n\n**REMOVAL**\n\n[https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/)  This guide really helped me to remove my sebaceous filaments in a manner that was not damaging my pores (i.e: pore strips) and really sort of reset my skin. The products that I used were: Paula's Choice 2% BHA, Aztec Clay Mask (With ACV, don't bother doing it with water only as calcium bentonite clay has a high pH and ACV will help to to neutralize it), and Simple Grapeseed Cleansing Oil. **NOTE:** Aztec Clay Mask is SOOOO GOOOOOD at drawing out your sebaceous filaments and textural irregularities to the surface, but in itself it is not enough and temporarily it will make your filaments look worse. But you absolutely must follow it with a cleansing oil, it will help to get rid of all those grits that's been making your oily areas rough and to sort of reset them.\n\n**PREVENTION**\n\nSo after your skin has been sort of reset, now comes the prevention part. And it is absolutely necessary for you to do the removal part or your filaments won't get better. For me, my sebaceous filaments on my nose were my main concern so here is what I did:\n\n1. Regular nightly cleansing with an oil-based cleanser (You really wanna massage for 1-2 to minutes and get any grits. Grits basically refers to hardened sebum.\n2. Followed by a foaming cleanser. Really massage it in and let it stay on your skin for 1-2 minutes for the surfactants to dissolve all of the oil that has been accumulated throughout the day. I would only recommend you doing this on areas where your skin is really oily and doesn't get dry. I use cetaphil oily skin cleanser.\n3. Apply your choice of BHA. I use 2% Paula's Choice BHA Liquid. I'm going to try the AHA soon as well to see if it makes a difference.\n4. Apply **VERY MINIMAL** moisturizer. Ideally one that doesn't have that many ingredients and is simple. More ingredients means the greater the possibility for your large pores to lead to the accumulation of cosmetic ingredients/ hardened sebum/dead skin etc. I use the LRP Toleraine Sensitive Skin one. It has like 7-8 ingredients and is very minimalistic.\n\nRepeat these steps 2-4 both morning and night, and steps 1 at night only.\n\nNote: My sebaceous filaments still fill up, but after 2 weeks now as opposed to 1-2 days so this routine has been a saviour. I'm going to start experimenting with an AHA/High Linoleic Acid oil to see if it makes a difference and maybe a form of retinoid cream down the road. AHAs/BHAs really help to address issue 3) skin that doesn't shed properly, hence the large sebaceous filaments. If skin doesn't shed properly, you want to avoid putting on moisturizers and a lot of products that have hundreds of ingredients and rather stick with something simple. And hopefully, the linoleic acid oil will help to balance my oil productions. After two rounds of accutane, I get a lot less acne now but sebaceous filaments and super oily skin has always been a huge concern for me. 1 year after my second round, the oil returned and really caused me a lot of textural irregularities, not only on my nose but all across my face. Here is my current routine and what has really helped me so far:\n\n**AM**\n\nLRP Toleriane Sensitive Cleanser (All areas except my nose). All of my face is oily but only get sebaceous filaments on my nose.\n\nCetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser (Only on my nose).\n\nPaula's Choice 2% BHA (Helps keep acne and textural irregularities under control)\n\nLRP Toleriane Sensitive Fluide (Minimalistic moisturizer)\n\nTO NMF + HA (Apply everywhere except my nose)\n\n**PM**\n\nSimple Hydrating Cleansing Oil (Only on nose to get rid of any hardened sebum build up). Will be very few grits but you want to do it every night to prevent large accumulation over time.\n\nRest of routine is same as AM, but I also apply Vaseline all across my face. I know what you are thinking, Vaseline on oily skin??? But using BHA 2x a day for those stubborn filaments leads to some dryness, and Vaseline really normalizes skin. I'm kind of addicted to it now lol, it feels so nice putting it on my skin as it doesn't clog my skin and can also help prevent TEWL - Transepidermal Water Loss which is another huge issue in skin care and can lead to a compromised moisture barrier and therefore acne etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my long post. Hope you got something out of it. I should get back to studying now, good luck!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This was a well thought out and overall great post! It was very interesting to read your journey in reducing sebaceous filament production on your skin, in particular your nose and/or (T-zone area) - and finding routines on minimizing further production. That being said, one important point that was left out in your analyze is genetics. Everyone has their own genetic skin-print, which result in giving you your skin type. So the most you can do is understand your skin type which will in turn empower you to make wise decisions. \n\nIn addition, I think it would be also excellent to add skin treatment that will help to reduce the uneven texture, and it will aid in helping your skin better absorb ingredients.  This will help in reducing the production of your over-active sebaceous gland. In my experience, microdermabrasion and chemical peels have help immensely. Especially micro which is safe to use of open and closed comedomes, and even texture on the skin. And it if you have fitzpatrick 123 and maybe 4, there are great laser modalities that you can use as well to help remove and/or reduce the appearance of comedomes. \n\nOverall, everything that you mentioned was great, and I like that you provide several options for people. Cheers!",

If you applied one clogging ingredient on its own that could cause problems. Likewise a long list of ingredients might be tolerated just fine if they're pretty safe. Foaming cleansers are fine for some, but I wouldn't advise them as a rule, especially alongside a lot of drying/dehydrating actives without a strong hydrating routine. Sebacious filaments and clogging can more visible as a result of dehydrated skin and in that case that could make it worse. Likewise if you have them with dry skin they can cause issues.",

    "body": "My Long Covid Recovery Story\n\nTL;DR:  got Omicron twice in 6 months, started long hauling and tested positive for 3 tick-borne illnesses. This is my recovery story.  As of today Oct 15 2022, I have no symptoms.\n\nMore details and resources that helped me here: \nhttps://survivinglongcovid.com/my-long-covid-recovery-story/ \n\n\nFirst Infection ‚Äì Omicron\nIn January 2022, I attended an event in NYC and shortly afterward developed flu-like symptoms. A PCR test at my local CVS came back positive for COVID-19, and I started treating my acute symptoms with the recommended aspirin, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, melatonin and a few other anti-inflammatory supplements. My blood oxygen levels never dropped below 94, and about 18 days later, I considered myself fully recovered.  \n\nAbout a month later, I started to feel ankle stiffness and pain in my left ankle that I had sprained 10 years ago. I though maybe it was from lower body workout intensity, so I went low-impact for my exercise routine. The pain persisted and worsened into May. It got bad enough that I went to a podiatrist who gave me a cortisone injection in my ankle and a 10-day course of meloxicam (pain killer).  I felt there had to be something more to this continuing health issue, so I went to a sports medicine doctor for a second opinion. He sent me for a non-weight bearing X-ray which came back with no issues visible, so recommended physical therapy. I did physical therapy (mostly stretches and theraband exercises) through June with modest results. The pain had now spread up from my ankle to the left side of my shin and I started to feel tingling neuropathy along the outside of my left leg and into my foot. \n\nSecond Infection ‚Äì Omicron B4/B5 Variant?\nIn early July, after visiting friends (who I discovered later were positive for COVID) I came down with an upper respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, fever, sore throat‚Ä¶ the works.  So, I went into complete bed rest for three days with all the usual supplements + aspirin to treat what I assumed was round two of COVID for me. On the fourth day, I felt better, so I went out to a car show with friends and then out to dinner that evening. The following day, the pain in my left leg suddenly became excruciating and swelling in both feet developed. I also started to have intense brain fog, memory loss, personality changes, suicidal thoughts, and general malaise. I lost all appetite over this week and stopped eating. I experienced extreme anxiety and couldn‚Äôt sleep for any reasonable length of time for several days. \n\nAcute Long COVID Symptoms\nAt this point, things took a rapid turn for the worst. I experienced the whole package of Long COVID symptoms that included full body histamine flush, severe edema in both legs, adrenaline dumps, panic attacks, ‚Äúair hunger‚Äù shortness of breath, feeling like I was forgetting to breath, chills, full body tremors, heart palpitations, left side numbness and neuropathy from head to toe, swollen blue visible veins, gastrointestinal pain, liver and gallbladder pain, shortness of breath, visual disturbances and ‚Äúfloaters‚Äù, fluctuating body temperature, extreme sensitivity to sound and light, dizziness, vertigo, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), left side weakness when walking, electrical shock feelings in my brain, random ‚Äúsmell memories‚Äù (where I‚Äôd experience strong nicotine smoke or other strong smells from prior life experiences), severe PTSD from negative childhood experiences, derealization, depersonalization, tooth nerve pain, trigeminal neuralgia, muscle spasms, and other symptoms that I‚Äôm probably forgetting at this point (the brain has a way of ‚Äúblanking out‚Äù the worst of life‚Äôs negative experiences).\n\nMultiple ER Visits ‚Äì I Am Dying, Right?\nMost of this severe period of Long COVID was a blur, but I ended up having 5 ER visits in as many days, trying to find answers for these symptoms. Labs and imaging came back fine for the most part. Bilirubin levels were significantly elevated at 2.6 (likely viral hepatitis), but everything else appeared normal. One doctor scratched his head and just told me point blank he had no idea what it was, but would give me a 5-day course of steroids and see if it cleared up.  Another doctor thought I had Lyme disease, so gave me a 14-day course of doxycycline (antibiotic). The steroid gave me extreme psychosis and clinical mania symptoms. My primary doctor gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, but I wasn‚Äôt interested in that approach, as I knew the ultimate cause was physiological, not psychological. The antibiotic seemed to have the most rapid positive effect. The night after I started taking it, I woke up during the night drenched in sweat feeling the same way you might after a high fever breaks; exhausted but with significantly improved symptoms. The day after taking the doxycycline, I felt well enough to climb on my bike and ride around the neighborhood. My vision, smell and mental processing had a clarity that I hadn‚Äôt experienced in months. Later, my tick-panel came back with positive titer for Anaplasmosis, a severe tick-borne co-infection of Lyme disease. My working theory is I probably had Lyme+co-infections, but my immune system had fought them off until COVID nuked it into total dysfunction which activated this underlying illness.  \n\nLong COVID + Co-infections Recovery Begins\nI felt better for several weeks until mid August when I over-exerted myself attending a family reunion and crashed hard with a flare up of symptoms. At this point, I had seen my primary doctor who found via testing that I was deficient in Vitamin B1, B12, D and several other vitamins and minerals. I was taking supplements recommended by her and a functional medicine doctor I‚Äôd seen, as well as some of the recommendations from the CovidLongHaulers subreddit. I had also discovered Tom Bunker‚Äôs Facebook group for curing Long Covid via Fasting/Autophagy and had struggled through my first 42 hour water fast, consuming nothing but water and electrolytes. The day after the fast, I felt terrible. However, I felt significantly better over the next few days. It was enough of an improvement that I decided to try it again every two weeks going forward. \n\nI went into ‚Äòtry everything‚Äô mode. It was all fair game.  I tried vagus nerve exercises, meditation, breath work, binaural music, ‚Äúohm‚Äù humming, transcendental meditation, infrared sauna, grounding, red light therapy, cold showers, hot epsom salt baths, massage therapy, foam rolling, an alpha stem device (CES), a low histamine diet, an acupressure mat, sleeping at an incline for silent reflux, cervical neck traction, physical therapy exercises for cervical spine instability (all my joints and neck were cracking and popping and felt extremely weak and loose), extended prayers of thankfulness and requests for healing to God along with Bible reading (mostly the Psalms), a carefully curated supplement stack, a religiously kept bedtime and routine for sleep hygiene, 16/8 intermittent fasting, monitoring my glucose with a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) and more. \n\nSupplements and Drugs I took for Long COVID:\nI‚Äôve linked to the brands/products that worked for me.\n\nLoratadine / Claritin to reduce full body histamine response early in illness\nFamotidine / Pepsid AC to reduce severe neurological and vagus nerve related symptoms early in illness\nMagnesium to help nerve pain and muscle spasms\nBenfothiamine (B1) as I was severely deficient\nB-complex (all the B‚Äôs)\nVitamin D + K2\nZinc\nLow-Histamine Probiotics\nNattokinase and Serrapeptase initially, followed by Lumbrokinase as micro-clot busting agents\nD-Ribose (big energy boost early on)\nNAC for NAD+\nBetaine HCI for low stomach acid (my PCP tried to give me PPI‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt take them)\nPeppermint pills to calm IBS-C symptoms\nLicorice root to heal GI and antiviral, anti-parasitic, antibacterial properties\nSlippery elm bark powder in smoothies to heal GI\nL-glutamine to heal GI\nMastic gum to heal stomach lining and what felt like ulcers, though H.Pylori test was negative\nQuercetin for autophagy and potential mast cell stabilization (MCAS)\nResveratrol\nIvermectin (for Babesia blood cell parasites, prescription required in the US)\nFish Oil pills for Omega 3‚Äôs\nDHEA taken sublingually to fix my hormonal imbalances related to the HPA axis including adrenal insufficiency\nCBD for sleep and anxiety reduction\nAdaptogenic Mushrooms (no, not psilocybin): lion‚Äôs mane, cordyceps militaris, reishi, chaga, maitake, shiitake, and turkey tail\nSlow-release melatonin for sleep\nA toxins binder including bentonite clay, activated charcoal and chlorella\nCistus Incanus tea with stevia, a potential antiviral combination (persistent viral spike-protein theory)\nTurmeric / Curcumin for anti-inflammatory\nGrass fed beef organ meat supplements: pancreas, stomach, intestines, adrenal glands, thymus, liver, etc\nD L-Phenylalanine for cognitive restoration\nBeet root supplement to increase nitric oxide and support liver and gallbladder function\nCustom tick-borne illness herb formula: Japanese Knotweed, Dokudami, Cats Claw, Gou-Teng, Andrographis Paniculata, Sida Acuta, Alchornea cordifolia, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Sarsaparilla\nDiamine Oxidase (DAO) supplement to block histamines\nAntiviral Herbs: oregano oil, red sage, holy basil, fennel, garlic, rosemary, echinacea, elderberry, astragalus, ginger, dandelion root and leaves\nBy September, some extensive labs from my functional medicine doctor came back showing I had Babesia, a tick-borne parasitic infection of red blood cells that can cause anemia.  I also had a low CD4/CD8 ratio indicating I had an immunocompromised state. Rather than throw more high-test antibiotics and antimalarials at my shattered body, I decided to start the herbal antibiotics recommended by the functional medicine doctor, as well as Ivermectin (a powerful anti parasitic treatment effective against Babesia, that has become quite infamous during the pandemic). At this point, I was into my third extended fast and seeing some small daily improvements in symptoms and energy. \n\nAs October rolled around, I completed my fourth extended water fast. My bloodwork had also shown low potassium levels and an imbalanced sodium:potassium ratio. I started supplementing with potassium daily and the combination of these two actions ushered in an incredible boost of energy with a complete disappearance of most of the symptoms. Feeling great, I took a risk and did a full body strength training workout for the first time in months, followed by an infrared sauna session. I waited for the PEM crash.  It never came. I woke up the next morning feeling energetic with almost no soreness in my muscles. \n\nThis is where I am today. I decided to create a website sharing what I feel made the most difference in my Long COVID recovery journey as well as the Lyme+co-infections I am recovering from. The treatments for both post-viral chronic illness and Lyme+co-infections are virtually the same, though the specifics may have some variables mixed in.\n\nIf I had to rank the top 5 things that made a difference for me. They would be:\n\nMindset ‚Äì once I knew I wasn‚Äôt imminently dying, I started fighting to survive with a positive outlook.\nTime ‚Äì the human body is a miraculous living machine, but it takes time to heal from serious trauma of any kind.\nFasting / Autophagy ‚Äì the level of improvement I saw after each extended fasting session was absolutely incredible!\nHPA Axis Homeostasis Support ‚Äì The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has a mind-blowing level of complexity and is still not fully understood by the world‚Äôs brightest immunologists. There are enough clues though, that with extensive lab testing, supplements, hormone therapies, physical therapies, breath-work, sleep hygiene and ‚Äòdoing all the things‚Äô that it IS POSSIBLE to rebalance this vital part of healthy human existence.\nHuman Connections Giving Hope ‚Äì I can‚Äôt tell you how validating it was to find people on Reddit and Facebook groups who were going through the exact experiences as me, having rude doctors telling us it is all in our heads, and worse. We are nothing without community and human connections. Hearing others‚Äô stories of survival, successful treatments, and a return to health is what gave me HOPE in the darkest moments when suicide was a real consideration. I am also thankful for the incredible support from my wife and friends in my life who stepped in to help with all sorts of practical things during the worst of my disability.\nI hope my Long COVID recovery story encourages those still in the thick of debilitating symptoms. And may we all find healing from the deep psychological trauma of this illness.\n\nAll the Love, all the Joy, all the Peace to each of you!\n\n‚Äî Josh Champagne, October 2022",

        "body": "Thank you so much for writing this! I wanted to add that I have been using psilocybin mushrooms to help process the deep psychological trauma that this has become, and to help cope with the loss of my entire support system and family. It is an absolute game changer for my ability to keep a mindset to keep going. \n\n*id like to add that I have to eat twice the normal dose to feel warm and fuzzy. I haven‚Äôt actually tripped out yet and I take 1oz at a time. Cannabis also stopped working. THIS IS A CLUE! I didn‚Äôt over look it and started to find out why they weren‚Äôt working, which led me to begin neurotransmitter testing. I have found my serotonin levels a few ticks above triggering the ‚Äútoo low‚Äù alarm. I found in the microclot theory- those insoluble microclots cause neuro inflammation everywhere. That actives the kynurenine pathways, increasing quinolinic acid, and ultimately depleting your main neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine) from near constant activation. \n\nI believe that is where the feeling of the epic loss of self and soul comes from. To test this, I added 5HTP*, a form of tryptophan (the precursor to serotonin) to my supplements. A month later I recognized a glimmer of myself in the mirror one day. Then I started to care for a plant. Then I didn‚Äôt watch another one die right before my eyes, day after day. (I used to be an avid gardener) then I started feeling a little more connected to my family. That was at a 200mg/day dose. There is a 400mg/day dose that I am going to try after the neurotransmitter testing! I am very excited to try that! I‚Äôve also noticed that cannabis and psilocybin were more effective (not as much as they should be) when I was taking a combination of 5HTP and complete amino acids WITH tryptophan.  \n\n*MEGA IMPORTANT:* You CANNOT take 5HTP while taking an SSRI anti depressant (like Lexapro). It will result in a dangerous and potentially deadly thing called Serotonin Syndrome. (I inched into this territory on accident and at one point was driving in town and didn‚Äôt recognize anywhere. I didn‚Äôt know where I was or have any sense of familiarity. I thought ‚ÄúOMFG I need a permanent person with me at all times now?!?!‚Äù Thank goodness I caught it quick and corrected it‚Ä¶ no permanent damage.) \n\nI think 5HTP and complete amino acids are going to be an integral part of healing in Long COVID, but as we all know‚Ä¶ I think anti depressants are the first thing the doctor puts you on when you try to get help. So there‚Äôs a very high likelihood that most people are on SSRI anti depressants and would need to work with their doctor/medication specialist to slowly taper off the SSRI in favor of 5HTP. I suspect people will get pushback from their doctors/psychiatrists but the anti depressant isn‚Äôt going to work with a serotonin deficiency.",

It‚Äôs only noticeable when he‚Äôs sweaty but the smell is always there if you go looking for it. He knows about it, we‚Äôve joked around about it before moving in together, etc. The best I can describe it is a sharp, acrid smell. Anyway, after about 2 months of living together I (25F) noticed I have it too now. Same as my bf, it‚Äôs only a problem when I‚Äôm sweaty but if I sniff my armpits I can still smell it. This has been going on for about a year now and hasn‚Äôt changed or improved. I don‚Äôt have a problem that he has it but it does bother me in myself as I had a boss comment on it once. Bf doesn‚Äôt mind either way but said he was curious about what he could do to make it stop. Is there anything I can do to make it go away? \n\nSome background info: \n\nI never had a problem with body odor before this past year. Even if I sweated there wasn‚Äôt really a smell. \n\nIf I do a bentonite clay mask on my armpits before I shower the smell will go away for a few days but it always comes back. \n\nI use Native deodorant (with probiotics). I used this for awhile before moving in with my partner though. \n\nI‚Äôve spent the last year healing leaky gut and I started a Candida protocol 2 months ago. I couldn‚Äôt take probiotics without massive bloating and inflammation until about a week ago. Now, I can have a little bit of yogurt without a problem. \n\nI‚Äôve had reoccurring yeast infections and eczema for most of my life, hence the candida protocol. \n\nPartner does have some stomach issues and loose bowels that started a year and a half ago but the smell was present before then. He was vegetarian for 4 years before that and he thinks the stomach issues started when he reintroduced meat into his diet.",

    "body": "(This is a developing post)\nHi, I decided to write about how I got rid of candida over the past two years, and I'm glad to assist anyone who have just started on this journey or having difficulties deciding which supplement to use or how to use them.\n\nYou dont actually need to pay alot on detox programmes. For the past two years my monthly supplement bill is around 50USD-70USD per mth. I did not visit any doctor or went into any physical pharmacy. All I buy thru iHerb.\n\nBackground I graduated in Nutrition and Microbiology, have worked in a lab with human gut bacteria and prebiotic. I had chronic gastric since high school (feeling bloated easily after any meal), diagnosed with liver inflammation back in 2016. I did a lot of reading about Biofilm, Candida, Heavy Metal, Endocrine Disruptors while using various supplements to self treat over the past two years.\n\nCurrently I'm studying sound healing and combining with nutrition/diet modification to help my clients detox, without relying on antibiotics/drugs. I have not visited doctor over the past five years.\n\nBooks I strongly encourage to read (you can find them on pdfdrive.com)\nThe Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush (Andrew Moritz)\nIodine (David Brownstein) \nThe Magnesium Miracle Sodium Bicarbonate (Mark Sircus) \nTimeless Secret of Health and Rejunevation\n\nMy first mistake \nThe first mistake I made is jumping straight to get rid of candida, coming from my days of learning western medicine, the first thing I thought of was killing them and getting rid of them. My first attempt knocked me out so hard I was having fever, cold shivers, headache, runny nose, upset stomach all at once for almost an entire week.\nThat is when I learn about die off symptoms. Basically I tried to kill candida, while they released toxin after they die, these toxins together with the dead cells caused an overload on my system and took me out.\n\nHere I would advise anyone who wanna work on candida to take a brief pause first. Take the time to fix your sleep first. Use magnesium, melatonin, zinc to help fall asleep better and get deeper sleep. Allow our body to have the rest it needs before beginning a proper spring cleaning regime. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3703169/)\n\nSecond thing is to identify the food, water and things we expose ourselves to. Humans are creatures of habit, we tend to eat/drink/use the same thing. Find out what are the things that contributed to biofilm/candida and remove them. (I'm using biofilm and candida interchangeably because biofilm is created by bad bacteria to shield them as antibiotic resistance strategy and candida grows inside biofilm and produces more biofilm) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167820/\n\nCheck your water filter, how much heavy metal is it removing? Is it NSF standards? I'm using Clearly Filtered at my home as it is one of the few filter that removes fluoride. I have an air filter and ioniser/air steriliser to filter/inactivate any allergens or toxin in the air that might interfere with my detox progress. (You need to do your own research on good quality HEPA air filter in your respective countries).\n\nWhile I'm on my sleep supplement, another thing I do is I take baking soda with water every morning (one teaspoon in one glass of water). This helps to improve my body pH (acidic pH is a very good breeding grounds for candida and biofilm formation). https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24611980/\n\nI did oil pulling as well in the morning. (https://www.faim.org/science-based-evidence-for-oil-pulling)\n\nMost of the toxin are stored in fat cells. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6101675/) That's why prolonged fasting causes certain levels of die off symptoms as the toxin is exiting the cells and passing thru the liver, before heading towards kidney (excrete as urine) and most of them exit via colon and we shit'em out. So the next thing I did is to clear out our intestine. (Think of it as cleaning the inside of a rusty old pipe)\n\nThe place I live in do not have any hydro colon therapy available, so I relied on rather simple solutions - psyllium husk, activated charcoal and oranges (or any pectin rich food) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653598004664?via%3Dihub). At this part we have not worked on candida yet, we are just clearing our existing system and unburdening it before the real work begin.\n\nTaking a good probiotic and prebiotic. Stop drinking any alcohol or taking antibiotic as they would only kill them again. Alcohol and antibiotic is one of the reason Candida in our body become resistant and stronger. The biofilm protects them and induced antibiotic resistance.\n\nDo a liver flush/gall bladder cleanse (only once for now, you can‚Äôt do it too frequent as it exhaust the liver) Feed our liver with NAC, Milk Thistle, MSM (look up Phase 1 and Phase 2 liver detox) This step is the most important as it prepares our liver to deal with the sudden release of toxin and Candida die off later.\n\nOnce all these preparation steps are done, we may now focus on attacking the biofilm and Candida. Anytime you feel uncomfortable means the toxic load has become high. Stop everything and go back the sleep part. Your body need the rest to deal with current toxic load before fighting another new battle.\n\nBiofilm can be broken down with enzymes, NAC, Nattokinase and Serrapeptase.\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195670117301020\n\nOnce they are broken down, it exposes the Candida and any bad bacteria hidden inside. That is when we hit it with oil of oregano, caprylic acid, turmeric.\nhttps://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jam.13049\nhttps://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.46804-0\nhttps://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jam.13602\n\nBinders, use this on the next day you took your biofilm/Candida supplement. Bentonite clay, activated charcoal, psyllium husks, pectin are all binders. Spirulina is pretty good too. They will grab the toxin and push them out from your system. Drink lots of filtered water (not bottled water, they have microplastic inside) to help move them out faster.\n\nGo back to liver support supplement and sleep supplement. The liver has fought its first battle. Rest.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5524320/\n\nThe next week do it again. Two days biofilm, two days Candida, two days binder, then sleep and liver supplement. If you have the budget, keep the magnesium and melatonin thruout your entire treatment. Get 9 hours of sleep everyday.\n\nMost of us focus only on the killing Candida part, we forgot about binders, we forgot to focus on sleep and liver care. We forgot to cut off the things that create a Candida/biofilm friendly environment. We forgot to read.\n\nI'm taking a pause for now and resume writing tmr morning. Feel free to ask any questions as it pains me to see ppl spending tons of money trying to fix candida but end up feeling frustration and beating themselves up. ;)\nI just realised I type a lot of text without proper formatting and highlights. Will do it tmr.\nAdding links tmr too for better explanation on biofilms",

        "body": "I have had Candida albicans GI overgrowth since taking Rifaximin (450mg 3/day for 2 weeks) for suspected methane SIBO in March 2022.\n\nAfter a few weeks I started getting quite ill.\n\nSaw doctor after doctor.  No help.\n\nThen saw a naturopath.  He ordered a microbiome test.[https://nutripath.com.au/product/complete-microbiome-mapping/](https://nutripath.com.au/product/complete-microbiome-mapping/)\n\nThe result showed Candida albicans at 78.7 with normal range less than 5.  Good bacteria were depleted.  Also some Streptococcus overgrowth, but nothing dramatic.  On herbal antifungals for 5 weeks.  Visited the hospital Emergency Department weekly crawling up the wall with GI pain, brain fog, extreme anxiety/panic attacks and feeling extremely toxic/intoxicated.\n\nGave the Naturopath the flick, and turned to clinical help - a GP.  Said it was the worst case she had ever seen, so distended.  Put me onto Nystatin which I was on until yesterday - 7 weeks.  It didn't do anything, but I felt felt a bit better - but still lots of bad symptoms, which would go up and down:\n\n‚Ä¢\tVery acute brain fog ‚Äì to the point of not being able to do simple things like thread shoelaces.  Everything requires a lot of effort.  I feel hungover.\n\n‚Ä¢\tExtreme bloating and gas by mouth.  Abdomen is very distended.  Bringing up gas often results in throwing up undigested food in stomach in the morning.\n\n‚Ä¢\tVery bad pain all over my shoulders and arms ‚Äì like fibromyalgia.  I get pain in my arms just trying to stick a fork into a steak at dinner.\n\n‚Ä¢\tItchiness\n\n‚Ä¢\tRed flushing ‚Äì face and backs of hands\n\n‚Ä¢\tSinusitis\n\n‚Ä¢\tHeadaches and migraines ‚Äì first thing on waking\n\n‚Ä¢\tVery bad tinnitus\n\n‚Ä¢\tVery bad neurological symptoms including anxiety and agitation.  Very irritable moods and a feeling of not being able to cope or do anything.\n\n‚Ä¢\tChills\n\n‚Ä¢\tConstipation and diarrhea.  Days following and with constipation I feel extremely gassy and brain fogged.\n\n‚Ä¢\tSore throat\n\n‚Ä¢\tFeeling hungover after 9 hours sleep ‚Äì can be like this all day\n\n‚Ä¢\tFatigue all the time\n\n‚Ä¢\tShaky\n\n‚Ä¢\tMouth feels like I have eaten a ton of sugar ‚Äì nausea and dry lips ‚Äì very white tongue in morning\n\n‚Ä¢\tLots of acid reflux and heartburn\n\n‚Ä¢\tRestless sleep ‚Äì wake up feeling intoxicated in the middle of night\n\nI do not consume any alcohol.  On FODMAP, GF and no milk.  Only drink water.\n\nColonoscopy and gastroscopy on 03 August 2022.  Asked the gastro to perform a duodenal/small intestinal aspirate to grow Candida.  This used to be the gold standard of tests.  This was to confirm the microbiome analysis.  That aspirate grew plenty of Candida albicans and also gram negative bacteria - also Campylobacter, a notifiable contagion in Western Australia.  The latter was possible picked up from new Labrador pup...  Other pathology stool tests also grew Candida albicans.\n\nSpoke to some compounding pharmacists who suggested a certain functional GP (I'm in Perth, Western Australia) who they knew had successfully treated others with Candida and bacterial GI and overgrowth.  Expensive! (AU$255 for 30 minutes).  But highly recommended. Very serious medical professional.  I consider that the Candida has become pathogenic and hyphal - possibly from consuming foods with oxalates which I have ceased.\n\nDr ordered the Great Plains Organic Acids Test and MARCoNS nasopharynx test due to bleeding sinuses and yellow gunk from nose.  The MARCoNS nasal swab grew penicillin and Streptococcus - he suspects I also have GI mould toxicity as a result.\n\nBased on my symptoms, he has put me on the following treatment protocol for two weeks\n\n* Allimax (allicin 180mg) 1 capsule 3 times /day before meals.  This is to break down the biofilm.  Allicin is also a potent antimicrobial.\n* Biocidin (Bio Botanical Research) drops.  1 to 5 drops 15 minutes before meals 3 times per day and 30 minutes after taking the Allimax.\n\nAfter two weeks, repeat for six weeks taking the Biocidin drop every third day.  This is to allow the fungals to penetrate out of the biofilm and kill what comes out (think of whack-a-mole).\n\nTried that protocol last night and extremely brain fogged and dizzy this morning.  Constipated all day yesterday, and went with heaps of solid faeces this morning.  Chest feels very full of something - could be gas, could be undigested food.  Cold shower at 6am no help.\n\nDr says to order the Great Plains Laboratory Mycotox Profile test and DNA test for mould susceptibility.\n\nThink twice before taking Rifaximin, and then make sure you take the right probiotics and prebiotics to keep Candida in check!\n\nHopefully this will be done by Christmas...\n\nPeter\n\nPerth\n\nWestern Australia",

This amazing dirt added spring and made my jerk-ass hair behave. \n\nMixed a few spoonfuls of clay with equal-ish parts apple cider vinegar, applied to wet hair and made sure to scrub my scalp as well as possible. Easier said than done! This stuff is no joke when it comes to cleansing.  It sucked every damn thing out of my hair, including moisture, lmao. \n\nAnywhoooo. Applied,  pasted my hair to the top of my head and put on a shower cap. Added the extra to my face cause ya know, waste not want not or whatever. \n10 minutes later I washed both my face and hair out making sure to get it all out and allowed the water to run down the drain for a good minute. I've heard it can clog up the drains but IDK. \n\nApplied shea moisture mukuna honey and yogurt hair mask, covered and let it sit for 30 minutes. \n\nRinsed, added a little more shea to the tips and applied the homemade flaxseed gel. Air dried and went to bed. \n\nHad defined curls this morning,  all I did was smooth some water in to tame a few fly away and diffuse for a little fluff. Easy peasy, mac and cheesy!",

    "body": "All this happened on the course of 3 years.\n\n* **CAUSES AND START OF SYMPTOMS**\n\n3 infections with COVID, poor eating habits (weird hours), poor diet (lots of fast food, soda, sugar), bad sleep schedule.\n\n* **SYMPTOMS**\n\nBad digestion (low motility), bloating, gas (burps and farts, foul smelling), nausea, dizziness, brain fog, insomnia, abdominal pain and distension, lack of appetite, weight loss, anxiety, depression, constipation (which led to anal injuries). Also Diarrhea. Also a seemingly unrelated constant upper neck (back of head) inflammation that was presumed due to poor posture but could also cause a dysfunctional vagus nerve (leading to bad motility, general bad parasympathetic function). Fainting sensation if hungry.\n\n* **DOCTOR's (WRONG) DIAGNOSES**\n\nGastritis, GERD, Crohn's or IBS due to suspicious marks inside the large intestines, stress. Pysch diagnoses: Depression and \"it's all in your head.\" Eating disorder.\n\n* **DOCTOR's (WRONG) TREATMENTS**\n\n1+ years of PPIs (this destroyed my stomach and made me very susceptible to infections), Budesonide and other remedies for IBS. OTC stomach antiacids. Psych meds: Benzodiazepine (ativan), escitalopram, rivotril, tradozone, mitrazapine, paxil, pregabalin, zopiclone.\n\n* **CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED BACTERIAL INFECTIONS**\n\nClostridium difficile (treated with vancomycin) and, after that, E-Coli (attempted to treat with a bunch of hard antibiotics that made me ill and also didn't work).\n\n* **PROCEDURES AND TESTS**\n\n4 endoscopies, 3 colonoscopies, abdominal CT scan, multiple bacteria-parasite-virus tests, microbiome test (result: big-time dysbiosis), multiple calprotectin tests (ranging from 150 to 6000), zonulin (high - indicator of Leaky Gut), low vitamin D, normal blood and thyroid values, no histamine intolerance, many IGG food intolerances (gluten, wheat, lactose, nuts, processed meats), multiple negative h-pylori. Official SIBO test was not performed because I was always on some kind of antibiotics and it could show inaccurate results.\n\n* **MY OWN (CORRECT) DIAGNOSIS**\n\nOnce ruling out everything else, I concluded I had dysbiosis and SIBO and proceeded to treat myself for it. Benzodiazepine addiction, eventually, that had to be stopped by withdrawing.\n\n* **THE SCHEDULE, DIET AND PILLS THAT CURED ME**\n\n>Mornings\n\nOn empty stomach: cup of ginger tea from root (natural biofilm disruptor), PHGG fiber, powder of artichoke, ginger, celery, apple, lemon, powders of Pro-Prabioma, Probiotic and Pro-Mucosa from TISSO, vitamin D3, Zenyth Leaky Gut powder mix, saccharomyces boulardii.\n\n>Between meals\n\nBentonite clay, activated charcoal (2 hours from any meal or pill). They're natural binders. Electrolytes or ginger nausea pills if needed.\n\n>Lunch\n\nCup of ginger tea before lunch, trimebutine and drops of Iberogast. Betaine HCL+enzymes, a mix of vegetable supplements, vitamin C, salmon oil.  Cinnamon, chromium, DGL licorice, plant aid for liver (Liv 52 - helps detox), magnesium citrate. 2 weeks of rifaximin and nystatin. Then, 3 weeks of natural antimicrobials pills: oregano oil, berberine, peppermint oil, allicin.\n\n>Evening / before bed\n \nGlycerin suppositories to help me poop if needed. Ambien 5-15mg, 0.5mg melatonin and some valerian for sleep. Activated charcoal.\n\n* **THE CORRECT DIET**\n\nNeedless to say, I had to stop all gluten, fresh dairy, processed foods, sugars, greasy foods. \n\nLiquids: 2+ liters of water, ginger tea, occasionally kefir and kombucha. Chicken broth soup with vegetables, 1-2 times a day, organic.\n\nSolids: gf bread, gf oats, gf milk, eggs, granola, gf sugar-free snacks, boiled chicken, rice, a variety of boiled or steamed veggies (kinda FODMAP but also some broccoli, potatoes and other stuff so not strict), gf pasta, white fish. Soy protein powder, no sugar.\n\nDesserts: 95% sugar-free chocolate, natural honey.\n\n* **AFTERMATH AND CONCLUSIONS**\n\nAfter 2 months of correct treatment, I'm almost back to my former self. I still take some natural antimicrobials some days, I find them to help maintain the microbiome and reduce symptoms. Charcoal is the best thing ever invented and I will probably take it forever, it's a natural antimicrobial and bloat remover, use it wisely. Doctors were mostly useless, my hospital stays were a total waste of time and money. I had to figure myself out. I will keep this diet for a long time, slowly introducing more diverse stuff in a way I feel comfortable. Now that I'm functional (maybe even healthy), I'm in no rush to go back to McDonalds or Coca Cola or other such bullshit. Lesson learned. Best of luck to everyone, and let me know if I can help you with advice.",

    "body": "Hey /r/haircarescience. I hope this post is okay. I wanted to share my recent success of using Bentonite Clay as a dry shampoo alternative. Here's an album I made on Imgur so y'all could see the change: https://imgur.com/gallery/2AKEEKY  (Yes, my hair has some fading green streaks in it)\n\nBasically, I try not to wash my hair for like.... days. 4 days or more. When I do I use that OGX biotin/collagen shampoo paired with Maui Moisture conditioner for fine, brittle hair. WONDERS. I do blow dry my hair on medium heat/high power after showers because, as I'm sure all you fine hair people are familiar with, it just goes limp if I air dry it.\n\nSo, in the meantime, when I'm between showers and hairwashes, I use this Bentonite Clay/ACV powder. Yes, it says it's for facials, but I use it in my hair anyway. \n\nI comb it down like you see in the first few photos, powder it on to my part then on the back crown on my hair. Then I hard part my hair on the left and right, powder there and then powder my neckline.\n\nAfter it's all powdered, I massage it through my hair, flip it over and comb through and BAM - it looks like I just washed it/sprayed some dry shampoo through it. \n\nI love using this instead of an aerosol can, because I don't know about y'all, but it always seems like the time I need my spray of dry shampoo the most - I'm out! I've had this tub of powder since December and it looks to be just about half now. You really don't have to use a lot to get your hair reset. \n\nI'm not sure if I covered everything, so please lmk if there are any questions! Thanks for taking the time to work. I hope this helps some people out there. Take care, y'all!\n\n\n**Edit:** Would like to edit and take a second to address the \"don't put clay down your drain\" issue. Seriously, you're going to be using so very little of this clay (especially if you do have fine, fine hair like mine) that honestly, natural hair build up in the drain is going to be more of a problem and idk about you, but I do a Drain-O like once a quarter or so anyway. This routine is not using tons and tons of clay like a ceramic artist would be using. Think about it, I've used *half* that container since *December.* A ceramic artist is going to be using about the entire thing to make one bowl. Of course that would clog a drain!! \n\nBe skeptical, be wary, don't be reckless. But also, I would hate anyone to shy away from this really exceptional treatment for fear of trying! \n\nThanks again, y'all! It's been really nice having discussions and trading tips with you. <3",

    "body": "You know, THE Aztec Clay mask. The super powerful one that you can either mix with ACV or water.\n\nA few years back I tried it out for a while, maybe twice a week, and was scared of using ACV on my face, so I only mixed it with water. At the time I was 21 and just starting to suffer from really bad acne out of nowhere, which I went on to suffer from until now - I'm 24. The mask didn't really do anything to help much back then so I went to just using it occasionally.\n\nFast forward to now. I had a horrible breakout in January, the worst of my life, and I didn't know what to do. I've been really trying to get to the bottom of my acne for the past few years, like *researching*. My dermatologist was little to no help - I didn't want to take Accutane, I wanted to figure out why I went from having clear skin my whole life to having terrible acne as an adult. I never really found something to fully solve the problem, only things that reduced it here and there.\n\nIn the midst of this I was suspicious that I could have PCOS since most of the acne was hormonal, deep cysts on my chin and jawline. I wound up looking back into bentonite clay and found a video made by someone who was transitioning - F to M. I'm, not personally trans but their story stuck out to me because their hormonal acne was caused by the excess testosterone that they were taking... While I clearly don't have enough testosterone to turn my body into a male's, excess testosterone is usually what causes hormonal acne in women.\n\nThis person recommended that you use this mask not once a week, not twice a week, but every single day and sometimes twice a day! WITH ACV. Which most people do not recommend because the mask is so STRONG. But this was the only change that they made in their life and skincare routine and their video documented their improvement to be pretty linear.\n\nI decided to repurchase the mask myself and try mixing it with ACV. After the first mask, I noticed a slight reduction in my acne so I decided that maybe I could try it every other night for what I considered to be an intense regimen. Basically, it wound up stopping any new pimple or zit in it's tracks. If there was one that was about to emerge, it would think twice after I applied the clay! I noticed on the days that I didn't use the mask, I would still start to develop more acne. - For the record, before beginning this mask routine, I was developing new acne every single day - The mask was reducing my acne faster than it was emerging.\n\nSo I decided to start using it everyday... and sometimes twice a day. It wound up turning this cycle in my skin around and I finally got it into a stage of what felt like remission and healing. I was no longer producing new acne and only healing the old scars. I then went into a stage of preventative measures - even though I didn't have any new acne emerging, I kept at my routine of using this mask once, and sometimes twice in a day... and yes, with ACV.\n\nIt basically broke the cycle of my skin producing new acne every single day. If you look at my skin now you wouldn't believe the photos that I took of how bad my skin was in January. My acne is gone. My skin is flawless. I have one scar on my chin. Given there are a few other things in my skincare and lifestyle that help a little... bentonite clay and ACV is definitely one of the primary, if not main factor in healing my acne.\n\nNow, if I miss maybe... two consecutive days of use... I might feel a tiny breakout thinking about emerging, like two pimples underneath the skin on my chin threatening to emerge... but after applying the mask they don't. So I believe that I am still somewhat acne-prone and if I were to stop using the mask daily... I might start to break out again... but who cares... I found a really solid solution. My skin is healthy, it hasn't been damaging in any way.  Even my dermatologist who was instant on my getting on Accutane was blown away at how much my skin had improved.\n\nSo what's the deal with this? Why does it work so well with my skin and why does my skin actually rely on it to stay clear? Of all of the things that I could have to rely on, I definitely don't mind this being the thing that it does...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: I just want to state that it is true that a lot of people do find this to be a harsh mask. My skin is used to regular BP use from my teen years and can generally take harsher treatments. If you're interested in this mask I recommend starting with weekly use and slowly increasing use if your skin tolerates it. Always listen to your body!**\n\n*Btw I think a significant reason that this does not irritate my skin with regular use is that I DO NOT USE FOAMING CLEANSER. I cleanse my skin solely with The Ordinary's Squalane Oil Cleanser... or water and a gentle washcloth. My skin has been far more tolerant of a lot of products since I stopped using any kind of soapy, gel, or foaming cleanser. Before I made that switch, products irritated my skin much more often. Be careful with your acid mantle. The reason I can use it so frequently is that it's the only thing in my routine that has the potential to strip oil from my face... and I always follow up with a facial oil after. Do do not do this at the frequency that I do if you use a normal cleanser.*",

I use it regularly twice a week and when going throigh bad breakouts everyday. It doesn't fix my hormonal acne issue but does reduce it. Hopefully my dermatologist appointment next week will fix it. Prolly with some accutane or spiro. Since it started after putting the IUD in (ain't removing it!) I don't think just a routine will fix it.

I didn't realize that the vinegar was more gentle but now that I think of it, yes; my skin is less red and dried out when I use ACZ.  I leave mine on for a long time as I am dealing with infected ingrown hairs from a botched electrolysis session....2 months and counting.  Once I rinse the mask off, I now bring a clean wash cloth with me and use that to help soften the hardened mask.  I keep the water hot and then hold the washcloth over my face to open up the pores more.  Then I use my Tatcha Oil Cleanser and use circular motions to wash the facial area and it pulls out the oil plugs and the ingrown chunks.  You will feel little hard things coming out.   It's very effective at dislodging.  I follow up with witch hazel toner and snail serum as well as Cerave Moisturizing Lotion with salicylic acid and that burns.  Sometimes I just skip the moisturizer and let my skin breathe.  But I try to use it when I can tolerate it.  The clay really helps alleviate redness and is just good for your skin.  The oil cleanser after is honestly something I learned from Nina Poole.  Thank you Tik Tok.",

    "body": "Hello. Just wanted to share this tip. I am installing a pond and in trying to find the most eco friendly way to do this have come across the fact that clumping kitty litter is made from pure sodium bentonite clay which is what you need to clay line a pond. This makes is a very inexpensive and very long lasting alternative to plastic pond liners which only last a decade or so. Clay lined ponds last hundreds of years. And there are nutrients in the clay that are good for you, and your fish and plants. It is completely non toxic. You must be sure to get unscented clumping kitty litter without any additives like baking soda.\nYou simply line your pond with the correct amount of sodium bentonite for your pond size and then cover it with sand. For my pond size I needed the sodium bentonite clay to be about two inches thick with an inch thick layer of sand over it.\nIt must be sodium bentonite clay because it expands ten times, on contact with water. There are lots of tutorials out there for using sodium bentonite clay to line ponds, like these \nhttps://shop.naturalwaterscapes.com/sodium-bentonite-clay-for-ponds/\n....https://nwedible.com/can-you-seal-a-pond-with-clay-kitty-litter/\nHope someone benefits from this tip. :)",

You didn't go to all that trouble to get shitty grocery market powdered sugar thats mostly just cornstarch anyway.  No.  You wanted to have the best set cakes made from the finest ingredients, and so let's store that stuff properly.\n\nGranted, there is quite a bit of data out there suggesting that as long as you keep it cool dry and dark it would be fine for an extensive period of time anyway, but for piece of mind, we can go one step further removing the one of the biggest negative factors when it comes to preserving *anything*, **oxygen,**\n\nI'm writing this to share my insight with people in hopes that even the smallest bit of information can be useful.   This is not meant to be definitive, but rather hopefully spark discussion as well. If anyone has good stuff to add in the comments, I'll update this post with it.   A big part of this my philosphy in basically anything that I do.   I'm the type of ADHD gal that will do something, then do it again when I get a new idea, and then again, etc. etc.  I will go into something with minimal research on purpose, because I want to make mistakes and learn from them, because sometimes they lead me to novel approaches on a problem everyone else has solved (probably not the case here).  THEN I do hardcore research afterwards and combine my experience with conventional wisdom.  This methodology is stupid expensive but has let me to be pretty dang good at a lot of stuff.  So in this particular instance, I lost roughly \\~130g worth of material in the process of messing around, but now here is the raw simple information.\n\n# Materials\n\n* Nitrile Gloves.   Alot of Nitrile gloves if your dealing with a lot.\n* Surgical Mask or n95 Mask (the surgical is more then fine, I just have a lot\n* Disposable sterile spoons, antistatic if you can afford it.  If you can't get this, just clean your implements as well as you can.\n* (optional) Weigh scale/boats, if that matters to you.  You'll need this stuff anyway for baking pairs of cupcakes, so might as well invest.  This can be fairly cheap.  I just a run of the mill one that's accurate to 1.0 grams but measures up to like 30 pounds, and then a 2nd one that's accurate to .001 g, but only weights up to 50 g.  Both were under 25$.\n* Clean, Unused microfiber rags.\n* Isopropyl in a spray bottle (for cleaning)\n* Food grade Vacuum bags.  Ideally Mylar.\n   * Mylar is less permiable to gasses.  It's also usually opaque by default.  Your run of the mill food saver bag will often, over time, be not so vacuum sealed.  Opt for a thicker mylar bag if you can.\n   * 6x8\" or whatever mm equivalent works great.  You'll want to double bag, which actually affords you a couple options:\n      * You can double bag in some other material bag, ie the bag you got your sugar in, and then use the mylar on the outside.  You can use mylar for both inside AND outside, though in this case I do recoommend getting one size up for the outside so that you don't have to fold the inside bag.\n* Vacuum sealer, ideally chamber style.\n   * So I'm some that's been using different vacuum machines for like 20 years now.  I've used everything from the standard vacuum saver brand yoiu see in big box stores to like really fancy ones.  And I use it a lot.  I typically drive an hour + to my favorite butcher/fishmonger several times a year to get good quality stuff and fill a freezer full of vacuum packed meats/fishes rather then going to the grocer for items in that category.  From this experience alone, and not just this experience this last week dealing with powdered sugar conservation, I can tell you that the chamber style is better over all, as are thick mylar bags.  The main downside is that your limited to the size of the chamber, but other then that,  It's\n      * Less mess\n      * easier to clean\n      * easier to control\n      * usually stronger vacuum\n      * more reliable seal, as chamber machines are usually pricier and have better parts.\n      * less likely to stuck out a bunch of powder out of the bag in the process, there by ruining your machine and wasting your material.\n   * If you can't afford this, regular vacuum bags are still better then no vacuum at all.  But you should make it habit to check it **regularly**.\n* Dessicant.  While most dessicants aren't as effective at freezing temperatures, it's better then nothing.  Some dessicants work better then others, so do some reseasrch an dsee what fits in yoru budget.  The cheap silicon bead ones  or the bentonite clay ons should be fine for the most part.\n* A freezer that goes below zero, ideally between -20 to -5 f. (-29 to -20 c).  If you can get a small dedicated freezer that is only for this, even better.\n* Freezer thermometer.  Don't just trust what the advertising tells you what the fridge is capable of, unless its a really fancy one that has like a built in digital thermostat.\n* Something to line your table.  Could be like a dispoable plastic table cloth or whatever.  I just taped down a bunch of wax paper across my entire work surface.\n\n# Plan first.\n\n* What do you actually need to do?  Are you just storing a few grams? 100? 1000?\n* If what your storing is only meant to last a year or two anyway, just keeping it cool dry dark may be enough.  Keep it in whatever it was delivered in, possibly even just adding another bag to the mix.\n* If what your storing is enough for a decade to a life time, parsing it out into \\~5-10g bags well be worth effort.\n   * This breaks up your supply so that you have less catastrophic risk of the entire supply going bad because it was all stored together.  As the saying *actually* goes, one bad apple, **spoils the barrel.**\n   * You may be tempted to break it down into yearly supplies.  **Don't do this**.  seriously.  Little 1-2 gram bags are way more trouble then its worth.  You'll likely lose a bunch transfering it into a bunch of tiny baggies.  In all honesty, It's actually easier to have a 5-10 g inner bag, take out out what you need, and then **MOVE** that inner bag to a new outer bag and reseal.\n   * If you happen to just have only 5-10g in the first place, just keep it in the bag it came with, and then put that in a mylar outer bag.\n* If what your storing is enough to make cupcakes for the entire city, consider parsing it up into a bunch of 50-100g bags.\n   * Don't get to hung up on perfect measurements.  Your measurements matter when your baking your cupcakes.  When your just storing stuff, just eyeball the amount in the bag.  You'll make less mess and lose less stuff if your not to hung up on making each bag perfect.\n   * In the situation where you parsing out into many many bags, move everything to a new inner bag, and then seal into a mylar outer bag.  Label and date everything.  In situation since you can weigh the empty bags before hand, you can use this information to get the final weight and mark that on the bag if you so choose.    The 6x8\" in bag is pretty good for storing rougly 50-100g.\n   * In a situation where you are moving EVERYTHING out of the original bag, consider actually just folding up the original bag up flat and vacuum packing it into it's OWN mylar bag and label it scraps.  You, powdered sugar clumps and sticks onto the side of most things really easily.  A lot of tutorials out there will tell ya to painstakingly scrap every last bit you can out of the bag.  My advice: **just save the empty bag.**   There will likely be enough residue to in there to last a very long time if you *really really* nead it.\n\n# Basic Process\n\n* **INNER BAGGING**\n   * If keeping original bag,  move contents down to the bottom.  try to spread it into a flat chunk at the bottom, enough to fold over the top of the bag.  DON'T seal the inner bag.  If do, the vacuum won't reach it.  Folding it over should prevent its contents from spilling out.\n   * If transferring to a new bag, do the following:\n      * If it's a soft bag (like a ziplock,), find a contain big enough for the bag to sit in the same way you line a trash bag.  THose little like 1 pint round plastic to go containers you get from restaurants actually works really well (obviously like clean it up really well).  This basically turns your bag into a free standing bowl, thereby freeing up your hands to carefully scoop what you need into the back.  It also make it easier to eyeball, or even measure what your putting in if you got it on a scale.\n      * If using a mylar bag, you can kind of origami it into a square colum shape, and then stick it in like a 1qt to go container to stand it up.\n      * Move contents into the bags however you best can.  I find gentle scraping it out with a steril spoon works.  **SLOW GENTLY MOVEMENTS.**  Otherwise this stuff really goes *everywhere*.\n      * When you bag has reached satifactory quantity, give it gentle taps to settle it evently to the bottom.  fold the top of the bag.  If this the only one, move on the next step.  If you have a bunch, I recommend doing them all at once.  Just becareful not to knock over the finished inner bags as they are not sealed.\n* **PrIor to Outer Bagging**\n   * Switch to new gloves if your current gloves are a mess.\n   * gently wipe down the outside of the bag with a microfiber cloth if you have bits smudged on it..  This makes putting it in the outer bag much cleaner.\n* **Outer bagging**\n   * Slip the inner back into the outer bag and neatly and  flat as you can.  Make sure to conserve the fold over part.  Slip a pack of dessicant in.\n   * Fold over the top of the mylar bag and put a crease, about 3/4-1\" (20-25 mm) from the top.  **It's very important** to that crease straight so that essentially the top portion is as flat together and unwrinkled as possible.  Any wrinkles in that top portion can potentially introduce a leak in the sealed bag, one that might not even be obvious at first but devastasting later.  That top portion needs to stick together like to sheets of paper in the middle of your printer tray.   Also don't seal it folded, the fold is for the crease, which helps flatten the top.\n   * After you've done all the bags like this, once again, switch glovess if needed and then wipe down the outside with a clean unused microfiber rag.\n* **Vacuum Seal**\n   * If your using an external sealer, youll essentially see it seal as it goes.\n   * If your using a chamber sealer and never used one before,, what you'll likely see is it looking like it's NOT sealing.  What happens in a chamber sealer is it builds negative pressure outside the bag, and then right at the end, it sucks that air all at once.   This is the reason chamber sealing is so much more effective.   With external, you get the negative pressure that the pump can produce, at a 1:1 ratio.  With a chamber sealer, that same or better pump produces that negative pressure over a chamber much larger then the bag, so when its release, it effectively multiplies the amount of negative pressure.\n* **Finish Up**\n   * Clean up your equipment, bag and dispose single use items.\n   * Bag, label, freeze.\n   * Consider putting dessicant the freezer.\n   * Consider putting a child safety lock on the freezer, and a sign to tell people to keep out.\n   * Throw you clothes in the wash, take a nice hot bath to congratulate yourself.  Or a shower.\n      * (here's a shower thought.  I knew this dude who had like 6 nipples.  The 2 normal ones, and then like 4 extra tiny ones down his abdomen.  I think it's a rare thing that can happen.  He's totally cis, but if he was trans, would he have 2 boobs or six?)\n\nI may do a video later.  I just wanted to it all written first while it was still fresh in my head, as my last post received lots of positive feedback.\n\n**Product Recommendations:**  \n(if you have other products to recommend, please leave them in comments I will add them.  Especially if you are in other regions like EU, AU, etc.)\n\n**OrganizationIcy104 (moi) recommends:**  \n[Avid Armor Ultra One](https://avidarmor.com/avid-armor-ultra-series-one-chamber-vacuum-sealer-system/) : This is probaly the most affordable chamber sealer that's reliable, and a good size (not to big, not to small).  You can find it on amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CL1B153Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) , though its currently out of stock.\n\n[Mylar Bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CNH9FDKS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) This ones are really solid.\n\n**K\\_T\\_RA:** Here's another video on dessicants and O2 absorbers.

    "body": "About ten days ago I posted a few pictures of a muddy hole in the ground and some details about the wildlife pond I was starting to build. I'm pleased to report that I've made some progress and went from having a muddy hole in the ground to....a not-muddy hole in the ground! \n\nWhat I did in the last week: I cut down a big dead tree that was right next to the pond (now a stump in the rock garden) I dug down another 6-12 inches all the way around and made a hole in the deep end that was 3 ft +. I lined the bank with flat stones. I put 120 lbs of unscented cat litter (bentonite clay) into the bottom and and on the sides, wetting it and making a clay seal about 2 inches deep, which I mixed and smoothed by hand, mashing it between the stones on the bank, and compacting by wallowing with my feet. Over this I put another 2 inches of clay that was dug up from around the property (also compacted by foot), followed by a layer of river pebbles that I had left over from another project (again, compacted by foot)\n\nInside the pond I made a few small caves, one in the bottom of the deep spot and a couple on the sides. I put a piece of rotting wood as part of one of the caves and a dead log that goes out of the water as part of another. \n\nI started the gardens that will go around the pond. I transplanted 2 types of ferns and some jack-in-the-pulpits from the woods around the house into the corner garden, which is fairly shaded. I also found some wild strawberries and wild geraniums that I placed around as well. Lots of rocks, more to come.\n\n There is a shaded side with a bush that I left there and although it's not aesthetically pleasing per se, i put a bunch of the rotting bark and small pieces from the dead tree as well as leaves from last fall. This will (I believe) create an area that is a great natural habitat right on the border of the pond and increase the ability of the pond to serve as a part of an already vibrant ecosystem.  I remember a comment someone on this sub had made awhile back about someone's pond \"you've created a pond in the middle of a desert and wildlife will have a harder time finding it\" or something to that effect,  and that stuck with me. \n\nStill to come...water? We had some heavy rains in the last week while I was working and it filled up twice (before the liner was in) and drained by the end of the next day (last picture shows what it looks like with water in it, just for fun), but no rain since i finished the liner. More plants, around the border and in the marginal areas (between the two large rocks with bare spaces in between, this is where the runoff enters the pond and is usually damp and gets decent sun, here I plan a patch of joe pye weed and a patch of swamp milkweed. Then, once water is in the pond, plants as well,  of course. I'm still feeling it out as far as what will go in, someone had suggested lizards tail and I'll probably give that a go, along with some hornwort and water celery to start. \n\nWildlife update: one morning when the pond had water in it, I saw a bird (I think it was either a mourning dove or catbird) at the shallow edge taking a drink and a tiny splash). It's a start! \n\nThoughts? Concerns? Advice? I'm really excited about the input I got on my last post, and would love to hear what everyone thinks of the project. ",

    "body": "**Introduction:** Hey everyone, how‚Äôs everybody doing? I haven‚Äôt posted here in a while, so I thought I‚Äôd share what I‚Äôve done and learned up until this point in hopes that someone else can take something away from it. This sub has been super helpful in my brain fog journey and i will be forever grateful for that. This is going to be quite long but I promise you its worth the read, so lay back and maybe save this post and come back to it later if you don't feel like reading it now, I wont judge  :) If you'd like to skip over my rants and get straight to what's helped, feel free to scroll to the bottom to the \"everything that has helped\" section.\n\nI‚Äôd like to start off by sharing my symptoms and everything I‚Äôve discovered since then. I developed brain fog overnight roughly 7 years ago when I was 16. My symptoms ranged from short-term memory issues, concentration problems, cognitive decline, severe food sensitivities, poor hearing, sensitivity to certain fragrances, poor sleep quality, SIBO, undigested food in stool, POIS, sharp headaches, ear ringing (tinnitus), blurry vision, and vertigo. I‚Äôve had most of the basic blood tests, and everything has come back normal. I have a few theories on what caused these symptoms, and I‚Äôll get into them in the following paragraphs.                                                                                                              **what has helped reduce symptoms;** Diet wise, eating only specific fruits, vegetables, meat, and rice. I stick to foods as close to their natural state as possible. If you have any symptoms related to your gut or experience symptoms after eating, the foods you‚Äôre consuming might be an issue. Common foods that cause gut inflammation and brain fog include dairy, gluten, processed carbs, sugar, nuts, and even certain fruits and vegetables if you‚Äôre really sensitive. A good way to test this is to go on a restrictive diet for a month like keto and then reintroduce foods, that way You'll know which ones cause symptoms. IBS and SIBO are common diagnoses for people experiencing brain fog, and I was personally diagnosed with SIBO. These conditions are caused by an imbalance of bad and good bacteria in your gut, and they are usually secondary symptoms to the root cause. I took a few rounds of antibiotics, which significantly reduced my brain fog, but it eventually came back. For now, I stick to a restrictive diet. Diets often require a lot of self-discipline, and I‚Äôve had a hard time sticking to a select few foods. Most of our serotonin is made in the gut; if your gut microbiome balance is disrupted, it can make you feel depressed and anxious. An unsuspecting person might feel these things and go to their doctor, who could prescribe antidepressants that may worsen things or, at best, just treat the symptom, not the actual cause. This is the case for many people who take antidepressants. Low vitamin D, poor diet, and even stress can cause depression, so consider these factors before starting antidepressants. But sometimes they do work and can help; it really depends on the person.                                                                                              \\*\\*Hidden killers;\\*\\*If you‚Äôve been tested by doctors and everything comes back normal, you have to look deeper. We‚Äôre not as medically advanced as we think, and there are many deep-rooted issues that we can‚Äôt detect through most basic tests. We‚Äôre constantly exposed to toxic products, and there are thousands of chemicals in our air and food. Mold is also a hidden killer. It‚Äôs no wonder people are experiencing strange symptoms that can‚Äôt be solved. Our bodies aren‚Äôt capable of handling so many toxins.\n\nI‚Äôve lived in a moldy house for most of my life, and I suspect that‚Äôs what‚Äôs contributing to, if not causing, most of my symptoms. My symptoms were alot worse when i was living ina  moldy home, I felt better instantly after moving out. Mold isnt always obvious, check your house!! Black mold is extremely toxic, so it‚Äôs important to check if you have it. Mold releases what are known as mycotoxins which enter your gut, brain, fat tissue and cells. This can alter cognition and prevent you from absorbing nutrients from food properly along wiht hundreds of other symtoms.                                                                       **Dental health;** Dentistry is another big one. Amalgam fillings and root canals can be toxic to our bodies. Amalgam fillings contain mercury, which slowly leaches into the body in small amounts over time. This can cause various symptoms. Amalgam mercury fillings have been banned in multiple countries due to their potential dangers and side effects. Root canals, if not done properly, can fill with bacteria over time and cause havoc on your immune system. If you have these, they‚Äôre worth getting checked. The good news is that these usually aren't the root cause of symptoms but are contributing factors so dont freak out if you have any but keep in mind they can contribute to your symptoms.                                                                                                           **Mental health;** Negative self-talk and self-esteem issues often accompany brain fog. Since developing this condition, I‚Äôve beaten myself up, telling myself I‚Äôm dumb, not good enough, a poor speaker, and that I‚Äôll be stuck like this forever. At times, I‚Äôd feel powerless, ashamed, and defeated. It‚Äôs easy to fall into that loop. It‚Äôs important to be aware when you find yourself doing that. Remind yourself, you are not your thoughts. It isn‚Äôt your fault you developed brain fog, and you are not stupid. This is a temporary condition, and you can and will get through it. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap of negative self-talk and doubt. I know it sucks, but you are the only voice you‚Äôve got, so believe you can get through it. It‚Äôs easy to think you‚Äôre doomed, but I promise there is a solution out there waiting to be discovered. Stress and brain fog go hand in hand; if you have brain fog, you‚Äôre probably stressed out about it. It can be extremely helpful to shift your focus onto a hobby or activity you enjoy, like working out, meditating, or swimming. If your attention is constantly on how badly you feel, that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre going to feel. Attention is arguably your most powerful tool, so shift it wisely. Meditation and breathwork are helpful practices. I'm not insinuating you should bypass your pain, but don't linger on it.\n\n**Western doctors and conventional medicine;** If you‚Äôre looking for your conventional doctor to solve this for you, you'll be in lingo forever. They can be of help, but many of these conditions and symptoms are newly discovered, and doctors may not know how to test for or treat them. It‚Äôs going to require a lot of research, alternative medicine, and maybe a functional doctor, but you have to do the work‚Äîno one is going to do it for you. If you think you‚Äôve tried everything, you haven‚Äôt. There‚Äôs always something you haven‚Äôt tried.                           **Marijuana and Psychedelics;** I've found mild success from THC and Psilocybin mushroom microdosing. Smoking weed can be super helpful for reducing stress but if your anxious, weed can amplify that and you may have a negative experience, that doesn't mean weed is bad, it may not be for you but its worth a shot. I realized that weed didn't make me anxious, it relaxed me enough that i was able to see my already anxious state and amplifies it. It simply communicates, \"hey this is how anxious you normally are but you're not always aware of it\" take this as an opportunity to sit with the anxiety. Microdosing mushrooms can be helpful in shifting your focus in the sense that it takes you out of the 'im doomed' perspective, its a really great tool for shifting old and limiting thoughts and perspectives that may be hindering your growth. At the end of the day it is just a tool that can aid you but it is not a long term solution. These substances are to be taken very cautiously, if you consider them, do your research and start really slow.                                                                                             **Taking notes;** If you‚Äôre lost and have no idea where to start‚Äîand I know how hard this can be with brain fog and memory issues while trying to figure out why you have them‚Äîuse tools like taking notes and journaling to your advantage. If you‚Äôre forgetful, write things down, keep track of your symptoms, and any new changes and treatments. It‚Äôs a good feeling knowing you have it all down and out of the way. Remember, change is cumulative; it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll fix this overnight. It‚Äôs okay to start off really small. Make your bed in the morning, clean your room if it‚Äôs messy, research your symptoms, and take notes when you can. Be willing to try new things. Before you know it, you‚Äôll have learned so much.                                                                                                            **Helpful communities;** there‚Äôs a world of conditions, causes, and treatments that you may not know exist. There are goldmines of helpful groups and info on Facebook. Almost everything I've learned has been from FB communities. There's thousands of people going through very similar things as you sharing what's helped them, it can be so helpful to talk to others so you know you are not alone. Join Facebook groups (if you want links to some good ones, I‚Äôll send them to you) You'll get access to extremely helpful guides and ways to treat your brain fog, I don't intend to advertise or sell anything, most of these methods are fairly cheap and nobodies profiting but you !                                       **Everything that has reduced my symptoms;** Coffee enemas have been impeccably helpful in reducing brain fog. For those of you who don‚Äôt know what this is, it‚Äôs a procedure that involves inserting a tube into your rectum, with a bag above you filled with a coffee solution. You‚Äôll insert the tube, let the coffee in, and hold it for about 10 minutes. Afterwards, you release. The purpose of the coffee is that the caffeine stimulates the liver to dump old bile and toxins, and you also get a nice caffeine boost. It isn‚Äôt as painful or uncomfortable as you might think. This can be immensely helpful for anyone suffering from gut issues.\n\nThe next cleanse that has significantly helped me is liver flushes. The purpose of a liver flush is to push out toxic stones that accumulate in your gallbladder and liver over time. You can‚Äôt see them, but everyone has these mini stones; I‚Äôve seen them myself during liver flushes. To do a liver flush, you‚Äôll drink 1 liter of apple juice daily or malic acid in 1 liter of water. The purpose of the malic acid is to soften bile ducts and make it easier to flush the stones. You‚Äôll drink this mixture for 6 days. On the 6th night, you‚Äôll drink a solution of Epsom salt water, olive oil, and lemon juice. The next morning, you‚Äôll flush everything. I thought it was hocus pocus until I tried it and saw what came out. I felt pretty incredible afterward, so it does work. If you want a more detailed guide, feel free to ask me\n\nThe next thing is meal spacing. Your body has ideal times for digesting and processing foods. Snacking whenever you want is super tempting, but it isn‚Äôt good for your metabolism or cognition. It can make you feel sluggish and slow. There‚Äôs optimal timing for eating foods, and fasting between meals is essential to give your body time to rest and digest. For best results, eat 2 to 3 meals daily with a 6 to 12-hour gap between meals. I find eating once in the morning, anywhere from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., then fasting until about 6 p.m. and having another meal works well. Also, for quality sleep, it‚Äôs best to avoid eating about 3 hours before bed. Your body needs the energy for resting, and I always feel worse in the morning if I eat before bed.\n\nIf you have SIBO, IBS, or any stomach-related condition, antimicrobial herbs and natural antibiotics like oregano and garlic can be life-saving. For me, I‚Äôve had a bad case of SIBO, and cycling these natural herbs with my foods has led to noticeable improvements in my mood and energy levels. Methylene blue is another chemical that‚Äôs helped with my energy levels and mood; it works as an alternative to antidepressants. A good probiotic supplement can be helpful if your microbiome is out of balance.\n\nDetoxing supplements and binders are also important. We are exposed to thousands of chemicals, microplastics, heavy metals, and mold in our air, food, and water every day, which makes it harder for our bodies to recover and heal. Natural binders like activated charcoal, shilajit, and bentonite clay can be super helpful for binding to toxins in our bodies. These should be taken away from food by about 1 to 2 hours.\n\nNasal rinses have been mildly helpful for me. If you have any sinus symptoms, a nasal rinse could help. There have been many posts in this sub with success from nasal rinses. Our nasal passageways are directly connected to our brain, and many people have found success with rinses. I won‚Äôt give a specific rinse, but I will say it‚Äôs worth looking into.\n\nAntifungals have also been resourceful. I take ivermectin and itraconazole, which are meant to target fungus, mucus, and parasites. Detoxing via the sauna has also been useful. If you have access to a gym that has a sauna, using it a couple of times a week for 10 to 20-minute sessions can be very helpful. Saunas and steam rooms penetrate deep into your tissues and allow your body to sweat out toxins that have been stored for years. Get access to one if you haven‚Äôt already.\n\nMy brain fog has been reduced by about 60 percent. I still have lingering symptoms and brain fog, so I‚Äôm still discovering new methods and ways to treat myself. I‚Äôve made immense progress by being open-minded toward Eastern medicine and non-traditional ways of healing, and I think everyone can benefit from these. Most doctors don‚Äôt know about these healing methods; you‚Äôve got to take your health into your own hands if you truly want to heal. I didn't go into detail for most of these methods because the post would be way too long, if you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments or DM me.",

So I genuinely think that Brain fog is stemming from us eating bad and not getting the necessary nutrients the body needs to operate. The food we eat today even healthier foods lack minerals and nutrients that‚Äôs in the soil. It really crossed my mind when I was watching a tik tok video from a expert dr/ nutritionist dr Wallach(passed away) and he said how the body needs these essential minerals amino acids fatty etc or the body will be imbalance. So I took his advice and I have supplemented a multi vitamin that consist of vitamin d calcium vitamin k and magnesium I got a omega 3 supplement, Shilajit or Fulvic acid (contains 80+ minerals) and pure organic sea salt. As well as I have supplemented Ginko Bilbao and gotu kola specifically to help the Brain function and its been about 2 or so weeks that I have been on this routine as well as drinking from non microplastics and avoiding bad processed food not entirely but cutting back and I have noticed drastic improvement!! I‚Äôm telling you guys look into deficiency and really ask yourself have u been getting the necessary nutrients you need for your body to be optimal",

I have hypersensitive skin but I personally never had a problem because I always mix with Bragg's apple cider vinegar. I was curious to use water instead of raw ACV. Wow, I looked like a cooked lobster for almost an hour after using Aztec Secret. I decided to look up bentonite clay and discovered that its pH is between 8 - 9.7 (depends on brands: [Living Clay](http://www.livingclayco.com/livingclay1.html)'s bentonite clay is 9.7 and [Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/4032831/4581040.htm) is between 8.3 to 9.1 - I am not able to find pH info on Aztec Secret) which it is slightly alkaline than [baking soda (pH 9)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/). Our skin is between 4.5 to 5.5.\n\nUndiluted apple cider vinegar's pH is between 4.25 to 5 and when it is mixed with bentonite clay, the pH will be neutralized.\n\nDistilled/pure water's pH is 7 (neutral) but the problem is that we all normally use tap water. It might range from 6 to 8 - it depends on county and city. Distilled water or tap water with bentonite clay, it still leans to alkaline.\n\nIt is super important to mix bentonite clay with raw ACV to balance out the pH.\n\nInteresting information on pH scale: [pH 10 is 10 times more alkaline than pH 9 and 100 times (10 times 10) more alkaline than pH 8.](http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/184ph.html) Can you imagine from pH 5 to 9? That's around 400 times or... 100,000 times? Meh, my math might be off. Hope someone here can chime on the difference between pH 5 and 9. (*Answer: 10,000 times*)\n\n---\n\nClay's pH:\n\nCalcium Bentonite (aka Aztec Secret): 8 - 9.7\n\nFrench Green (aka Illite Clay or Sea Clay): 7.75\n\nFuller's Earth: 7.5\n\nRhassoul (aka Red Moroccan or Red Clay): 7 - 7.5\n\nDead Sea Mud: 7\n\nKaolin (all colors): 6\n\nMoor Mud: 4.5 - 5.5",

Before when I used water, it was such a process to churn the mask into a goopy uneven paste. With acv, I barely had to mix it and it felt like liquid velvet as I applied it to my skin.  \n\nI never experienced a red face post-mask, (when mixed with water) but also didn't have noticeable results.  However, after just one acv mix, my pores are very visibly improved. The skin where I'd applied the mask was pink once I washed the mask off, but pink as if I had just exercised, not irritated or inflamed, and was back to normal and *glowing* 20 mins post mask removal. \n\nAnyhow, internet info can be a crap shoot and this might be the first time I have greatly benefitted from skincare advice.

    "body": "A year ago I was so fatigued & sick that I was unable to get out of bed. The POTS & dizziness were so bad that I fell over / fell into walls trying to get to the bathroom or to the kitchen. 31F - first infected in September 2022. Symptoms: POTS, dysautonomia, heat intolerance, histamine intolerance, fatigue, brain fog, blood in stools, panic attacks, anaphylaxis reactions, dissassociation, heart racing & chest pains.\n\n*IT GETS BETTER.*  \nThis post is for anyone who is feeling as disheartened, desperate & depressed as I was this time last year. I promise you. It does get better. You CAN & you WILL get better!! I believe in you!!\n\nNow, a year later, I am able to: cook three meals a day, go out for walks, hang out with my friends, sing and play guitar, concentrate on computer work for hours at a time and start seeing clients again. I've also started going to the library, expanding my diet, and doing yoga every morning. *This is not to brag, this is to give you HOPE!*\n\nI am estimating I'm at 70% recovery because I am not quite up to driving myself, running, working out or eating at restaurants yet. But I am hopeful to get there in time. My dietitian thinks it will be 6 months to a year.\n\nBecause healing takes TIME. Don't try to rush it!! Let yourself rest.\n\n**Things that have helped me the most:**\n\n**1. Visible App** - [pacing & heart tracking monitor](https://www.makevisible.com/) (before, I was overexerting myself constantly without realizing it. This app tracks your pacing points for the day and notifies you when to rest!)\n\n**2. Low Histamine Diet** **&** ***increasing calories***\\*\\*!!\\*\\* (My dietitian explained that sick/inflamed bodies burn more calories at rest than healthy bodies. Once I upped my caloric intake to 2800 -3000 calories a day, most of my fatigue went away. WOW! Literally, I just need to eat way more food. [Use Cronometer t](https://cronometer.com/)o find your recommended daily calorie amount, then add another 15% for yours!)\n\n**3. Mast Cell Stabilizers** (Vitamin D supplement, Low Dose Naltrexone, am starting Quercetin this week, Stinging Nettle tea later)\n\n**4. Detoxing** - Drinking a gallon of water a day & using binders when feeling really bad or reacting a lot. (charcoal pills, bentonite clay and now I'm trying aloe vera every morning for GI. Binders help remove unwanted viral debris, built up histamines & damaged tissue & toxins)\n\n**5. Green Smoothies** - [Goodbye AutoImmune Disease Protocol](https://www.goodbyelupus.com/?s2-ssl=yes) (I am doing the hypernourishing version as I have not yet built up enough veggies to go on a full veggie diet. But the formula is one pound of raw veggies a day + a half cup of chia OR flax seeds, and drinking a gallon of water. Plus whatever meals you eat. Doing this daily gives me WAYYYY more energy!!)\n\n**6. Radical Resting** - [Yoga Nidra, ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mM5Oks8yZc)meditation, [listening to healing frequencies](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qmMhFz7XZ0BpdwbiH10MyHAPUQunfkX&si=vzpbjUSxSi82B3yn), chanting & taking baths. You should be resting as much as possible. Several times a day. (Try intentional activities to calm the Vagus nerve, return your body to homeostasis & activate \"rest & digest\" where your heart rate slows & tummy gurgles. I do a form of \"resting\" before and after every meal to digest better)\n\n**7. MindBody Connection** - listen to audiobooks & read books to heal you mentally, spiritually and emotionally. Cut out socials & upsetting media. The book [\"You Can Heal Your Life\" by Louise Hay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFa-JH4SnHo) is a good place to start for this. (I realized that I had a lot of unprocessed trauma - which was basically keeping me from getting better. Once I started to heal my heart & release the past, love myself & make peace with life, I felt SO MUCH BETTER)\n\n**8. Family & Furry Friends** - lean on your support system, let people love on you and care for you. Embrace snuggles with pets. Be grateful. (I moved back in with family so I could rest, heal & stop stressing about rent. I know this is not an option for everyone... But take it easy as much as you can)\n\n**9. Gentle Movement** - stretching, Qi Gong, gentle / yin yoga. [There are POTS friendly & bed friendly yoga videos online ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5WNCvXRnBY)to get you started. Dry brushing, baths, and massages also work if you're not up to that yet. ([I made a playlist of easy & relaxing movement videos on YouTube.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qmMhFz7XZ3pCqhpvlhhPR9R2kdFpuOD&si=zpYnWRYN167THEpK) Now I just pick one a day and melt into poses to ease tension & stretch out my muscles, tone my body and calm down. Great for your lymphatic system)\n\n**10. Electrolytes** - the more salt, the better!! I use [LMNT raw unflavored](https://drinklmnt.com/products/lmnt-recharge-electrolyte-drink?variant=16358367232034) in my water bottle, drink organic coconut water throughout the day & pour a ton of salt (all types, pink himalayan, iodized & sea salt) onto every meal that I eat. This has helped a lot with the heat intolerance, too!\n\n**11. Habitica** - [Gamified habit tracking app for daily activities](https://habitica.com/static/home), habits & to-dos (you can go on Quests with friends, get pets, collect gear & more - this gives my brain constant hits of dopamine, makes me feel \"productive\" - even if it's just putting on compression socks - and keeps track of what to do next / what needs to be done. Really helps with the brain fog!)\n\n**12. Functional Medicine** - an intergrative & supplement, lifestyle based approach to healing is what I needed most. The FM Dr helped me more than anyone else! (Functional medicine looks over your entire medical history, living situation, injuries, past illnesses, and all symptoms to assist you in healing. Highly recommend. Most of this info came from the functional medicine doctor)\n\n***NOTE:*** *I am not telling you what to do, or giving any sort of medical advice. Just sharing here what worked specifically for ME. Long covid shows up differently for everyone and we all have different situations & coping strats. Here is my YouTube playlist I use daily for healing, stretching, Vagus Nerve resest & POTs:* [*https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qmMhFz7XZ3pCqhpvlhhPR9R2kdFpuOD&si=xlaHRWDH6X0npLAz*](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-qmMhFz7XZ3pCqhpvlhhPR9R2kdFpuOD&si=xlaHRWDH6X0npLAz)\n\n**What DID NOT work for me, personally:**\n\n1. Acupuncture - gave me the worst panic attack of my life. EDIT: I went during a bad flare up, so it's possible it was just bad timing! Just didn't work for me.\n2. Ketotifen - I felt SO drugged. It was bad. Had to quit.\n3. Working Out - Trying to \"push through\" made my symptoms SO much worse. And I would have a crash for days afterward. Nope.\n4. Specialists - the cardiologist, the ENT, the long covid specialist, the allergist, the GI doctor... NONE of them knew what to do!! UGH.\n5. Carnivore diet - pretty sure this is what gave me blood in my stools. Or maybe it was the antihistamines? Not sure.\n6. Antihistamines - loratadine & zyrtec did nothing but cause more side effects for me. I know, I know! Everyone says to use them! But it really just did not work for me. I am hypersensitive to medications, unfortunately.\n7. Laying Around ALL Day - resting is important, but your body needs movement, too. Staying in bed all day made me so weak, so atrophied & depressed that I lost a ton of weight. Seriously, just adding some gentle movement like bed yoga or reclined / recumbent leg lifts or arm lifts was LIFE CHANGING. It made me feel so much better. Just start small!!\n8. Being Angry, Afraid, Bitter - these emotions are the most inflammatory & damaging to the immune system. They will not heal you. They actively hurt you. Using Visible showed me that every single time I got angry, I was actively DAMAGING my body by my heart rate skyrocketing and kicking my nervous system into fight or flight. Getting angry, upset or panicked for even just one hour used up the same amount of energy that a whole day of calm attitude & gentle activity would. It's mind boggling.\n9. Blaming / Victim Mindset - shifting from a \"victim\" mindset (poor me, my life sucks, it's other people's fault, etc) into an \"empowered\" mindset (I'm going to do whatever it takes to get better, every damn day) got me going again. Focusing on how sick I felt and how shitty this illness is... only ever made me feel worse. Once I started focusing on tiny \"wins\" throughout the day (I got out of bed - YAY! I brushed my teeth - YAY! I took a nap - YAY!) it got easier to be grateful, to celebrate tiny steps, and start healing.\n10. Being Online - getting offline did wonders for my mental health. I limit my screen time everyday and it's been very healing. I started reading books, hanging out with my cat, picking up old hobbies again like painting and poetry and laying in my hammock. It's made me more present, creative and grateful for my life instead of just doomscrolling.\n\n*NOTE: I recognize that some of this may not be true for you and some of these points may be triggering \\^ so just take what works for you wherever you are at \\^ I am NOT judging you. There were months I was not able to go outside, was justifiably upset, and did not have energy to do anything but lay in bed and play games on my phone. That's fine. If that's where you're at, do what works for you. But as soon as I started feeling better and having more energy, these are the things that moved the needle the MOST for me on my healing journey. So I am sharing in case it helps you, too!!*\n\nWe can & WILL overcome this illness!!\n\nHang in there, friends <3",

This was 3 ER visits and trips to the cardiologist. \n\nI flew to Taiwan since health care there is infinitely cheaper and had the opportunity to go to one of the top acupuncture hospitals. I went to perform acupuncture the third time and this time I had gone during one of my extreme flare ups. He was the only doctor to tell me that something is definitely wrong, and proceeded to warn that due to the severity of my LC this one was gonna HURT. Within 10 mins my heart was completely still and at peace, and all my symptoms had left. I then had to take a couple months supply of Chinese herbal medicine and within 3 months of that experience I was more or less healed. \n\nThe only symptom to LC that stayed is my caffeine / alcohol intolerance which is probably a blessing in disguise. \n\nThough it didn't work out for you, I hope others read this and give it a try!",

    "body": "\n\r\n(TLDR at bottom of post for severe readers) \r\nBefore I dive into the meat of my post, I just want to commend everyone here for your courage, fortitude, and will to fight for a better future despite being dealt one of the most unlucky and shittiest hands life can throw at you. By fight, I mean Just existing and waking up to another day of suffering, and doing it over and over again. That is enough with this disease to be strong. \r\n\r\nI honestly don‚Äôt know another illness which can cut through the very core of a human being‚Äôs spirit like ME/CFS can. Living, but dead, is the best way I could describe my life for many years, merely existing, and it drives me insane how casually most doctors have been in their approach in caring for all of you, not to mention government organisations in many countries across the world who have seriously harmed and even killed many sufferers due to a lack of care and priority. After going through this and reading many horrific stories from all over the world, I‚Äôm convinced The dealing of ME/CFS by various authorities and professionals in the field is definitely somewhere at the top of the list as one of the biggest modern day crimes and injustices against humanity. Middle fingers to all the doctors I encountered along the way who flat out denied there was anything wrong with me. None of you deserve this level of trauma.\r\n\r\n**My History in the lead up to ME**\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm 31, Male and have been living with ME since I was 25. Prior to ME, I was a very active, outgoing and happy person that loved life. \r\n\r\nHowever, I did have a long history of severe health issues. At age 9, I contracted a bacterial infection called Clostridium Difficile, causing severe gastroenteritis which led to extremely severe ulcerative colitis, a permanent life long condition, within a span of months. I was messed about with doctors, putting me on all sorts of antibiotics which failed and only achieved nuking my good gut microbiome for the rest of my life.\n\r\nPCP‚Äôs/GP‚Äôs were lost and sent me to the Children‚Äôs Hospital, where I spent almost half of the year away from home and school, handled by more negligent and incompetent doctors, and because high dose steroids weren‚Äôt doing the greatest job - they begun to weigh up the option of removing my entire large colon altogether so that I would have to live with emptying my poop in a bag (attached to my belly) everyday of my life. Thankfully my Dad‚Äôs friend referred us to a gastroenterologist in my city who is world renowned - and he was the one who actually identified the C Difficile despite multiple negative stool tests. \r\nAfter numerous [fecal transplants](https://www.childrenshospital.org/treatments/fmt), my colitis completely disappeared along with the infection, and I was able to go back to school and be an active kid and live a somewhat normal life.\r\nFMT was great, and while it did heal my colitis and give me energy, it did seem to introduce several added health nuances by the time I reached puberty, especially when I needed another to address a minor relapse a few years later.\n\r\nBrain fog, joint pain, loss of social wit, post orgasmic illness syndrome [POIS - yes it‚Äôs real]( https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome), occasional lethargy, food intolerances and GERD to name a few things which is abnormal to be suffering from at age 15.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms waxed and waned and for the most part, and despite all these issues, I was still a happy boy who enjoyed a very good period of health and energy from age 17-24, getting to really enjoy my later high school and college years, was full with sports, family, nice social life and career.\r\n\r\nAt 24 years old I begun noticing greater than usual fatigue/lethargy which I put down to a very demanding work and travel schedule. My buddy and I had a trip to the USA planned which we had dreamed about for many years, as I‚Äôm an avid basketball fan and we were going to watch a few nba games and just enjoy being overseas for the first time.\r\n\r\nOn the plane ride there, I experienced my first crash, after waking up from a nap mid-flight. Initially thought it was just anxiety from being on a long flight for the first time, but the symptoms would soon become what I knew to be daily life and the first of many crashes. Uncontrollable shaking and muscle weakness, tachycardia, orthostatic intolerance, heavy limbs, extreme fatigue, air hunger, feeling of impending doom, terrible flu like malaise, etc.\n\r\nMy dream holiday suddenly became a 3 week nightmare, using steroids under my doctor to artificially mask the symptoms where I could, in order to survive on the other side of the world with a very mysterious health issue, that just seemed to appear suddenly out of nowhere.\r\nUpon returning home and sleeping heavily for weeks, I felt remnants of my normal self again, however everytime I worked out I would come home to debilitating flu pain and all the symptoms mentioned. Still, for the next two years the illness would present on the mild-moderate end of the scale, and for the most part I could avoid too much PEM by avoiding exercise, stress and keeping my working hours part time over full time, but I would have to literally work and do nothing on my days off to get by.\r\n\r\nTwo years into ME, we had a major water damage event at home due to a severe thunderstorm. Mold began to set into the drywall (which was unknowing to me at the time), but coincidentally my ME rapidly became much worse over the course of a few months, with new symptoms setting in resembling MCAS and craniocervical instability.\n\r\nOne night after operating the A/C and recirculating that air, I woke up in a pool of sweat, shaking uncontrollably almost like a seizure, with my brain and body feeling as if they were set on fire.\n\r\nFrom there my neck area (where base of skull is) felt forever changed, stiff, scarred, painful like someone had made a knife‚Äôs incision there. Along came Disequilibrium, vertigo, feeling like a very heavy bobblehead, tunnel vision, worse orthostatic intolerance/pots, and PEM triggered by the mildest activity.\n\r\nSuddenly I went from doing 8K+ steps a day/driving to as little as 300-400. I was now mostly bed bound, struggling to speak for minutes, listen to music or YouTube videos, watch TV, and even just taking a phone call from a doctor would completely wipe me from the plain of consciousness for weeks, and the cognition required to understand people was like that of a retirement home resident.\r\n\r\nMy brain was constantly on fire, and any of the mentioned activity would \r\nquickly trigger insane nausea and all over body muscle weakness and tremor.\n\r\nI began to make new enemies, especially with heat, as well as air conditioning, everyday house chemicals and modest amounts of noise/light. My life was suddenly falling apart and as the months went by i came to terms that i was disabled in the prime of my life (mid 20s). \r\n\r\nFive years later, I‚Äôm doing a lot better and although I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself ‚Äúcured‚Äù, I am back to moderate, and very close to mild now. I can do 4-5k steps a day (1-2k on a bad day), look after myself and live on my own, listen to music, call friends, go for a walk outside in the sun, and on an especially good day ‚Äì walking outdoors and lifting small weights etc. without any PEM or payback. I am still however not fit to work and get off disability payments - and My Mum helps with heavy lifting like the meal prep and cleaning, so I‚Äôm lucky to have her.\r\n\r\nInstead of leaving the sub altogether I thought I would take some time out to detail the journey to this major improvement from very severe to moderate, and I hope it helps to inspire some hope to those very badly affected.\r\n\r\n In saying all of this, I completely understand everyone‚Äôs ME is different, and that not everyone has the resources (like finances, caring family/support network) to partake in all of this like I was fortunate enough to.\n\r\nAlso, I acknowledge that the best outcome for all of us is science finally providing us with an evidence based pathway to get better (Bc007?), instead of throwing coins into the ocean and praying it will hit the right fish, in a sea full of grifters where trustworthy practitioners are scarce, and not to mention expensive. We are left to fend for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat was behind improvement (in order):\r\n\r\n**Identify and treat CIRS/Biotoxin Illness/Mold Avoidance ‚Äì moving to a low chemical low mold environment:**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was obvious given my sudden worsening over the period of months that followed the water damage at home, and the fact that I soon developed MCAS-like symptoms.\r\nMy family were able to fight our home and contents insurance provider to fund a  remediation using the CIRS aware building biologist that I developed a relationship with that year.\r\nBut sadly, while it did help in some way there wasn‚Äôt a big difference. Moving out to a place that was much cleaner with no history of water damage is what made the difference over a couple of years.\r\n\r\nIf you want to find out if your living space could be a contributor to your ME, it‚Äôs recommended to do an ERMI dust sampling test, which identifies and differentiates molds which produce toxic volatile organic compounds, to those that do not (like the ones abundant in nature). They are available to order from [Envirobiomics](https://www.envirobiomics.com/product/ermi/), super efficient company to deal with but test is universally expensive.\r\nYou also need to source an MD who is aware of mold toxicity, most functional medicine doctors are and will usually order you a urine mycotoxin test from ‚ÄúRealTime Labs‚Äù, which can assess your internal mycotoxin burden.\n\r\nStudies that have been done on this illness show that some people have the type of genetics which impairs the ability of the innate immune system to clear these threats from the body, and instead, they take up residence in the gut microbiome and other cells/tissues, continuing to produce toxic metabolites that cause a chronic low grade inflammatory response which can cause symptoms of fibromyalgia, me/cfs etc. as the immune system exhausts the body of its reserves by being constantly over activated. Connective tissue damage is also very common which can lead to cervical spine instability in patients without hypermobility (more on MMP-9 later in the post).\n\r\nIt‚Äôs also recommended to use binders like activated charcoal/bentonite clay to help remove the mycotoxins from the body, once you‚Äôre out of the environment as slowly as possible, as this causes worsening of symptoms. When I started my binding routine, my calprotectin level ‚Äì which is a measure of intestinal inflammation, went from 430 to 5000!! Due to the mobilisation of the mycotoxins I‚Äôm guessing (along with worsening of all of my symptoms), and it went back to normal towards end of the protocol. \r\nThis is just a basic rundown from my side and I highly recommend anyone that suspects their environment to be a contributor to look at Neil Nathan‚Äôs book ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù for a more comprehensive rundown.\r\n\r\nThe mold rabbit hole does seem very anti-science and quacky from the outside looking in, and I admit myself that I heavily brushed it off as complete BS when I developed a robust understanding of my ME.\n\r\n But I had the resources and nothing to lose by trying it given how bad I was, and I‚Äôm thankful I did. My latest urine mycotoxin test shows all values at 0 and completely aligns with the improvement in my symptoms, and there was even a time after the remediation In my first house where I felt a bit better with less PEM, and a few months later started getting all the symptoms back, still with the thought in my mind that the house was remediated and much cleaner. I continued to worsen despite pacing, and we soon found out there had been a recent and major silent leak in the bathroom right next to my bedroom which created mold behind the drywall, go figure. \r\n\r\nBy far one of the most difficult and inaccessible things to do is address the mold issue if you suspect it‚Äôs a factor. It involves the heartache of letting go of a lot of possessions that cannot be salvaged/cleaned, actually finding housing that is safe in this day and age, etc. it‚Äôs very overwhelming so I understand not everyone can do it. Wish we just had a drug that could dampen the innate immune system safely since that seems to be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nSome example studies on mold toxicity can be found [here](https://realtimelab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2.-Detection-of-Mycotoxins-in-Patients-with-Chronic-Fatigue-Syndrome.pdf), and [here]( https://realtimelab.com/learning-center/).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Address MCAS and block inflammatory mediators:**\r\n\r\nThis begun to work better after dealing with the mold issues and getting out of the bad environment, in Neil‚Äôs book I mentioned the large majority of mold patients he sees go on to develop mast cell activation issues. \n\r\nA lot of people don‚Äôt understand that failing to combine a h1 blocker with a h2 blocker drug does not do much to reveal if you‚Äôre responsive and may have mast cell/histamine issues.\r\nFor example, They go on an easy to obtain over the counter h1 blocking anti histamine medication like ceterizine without taking a h2 blocker like famotidine or nizatidine, which are both prescription only drugs. \n\r\nI can‚Äôt locate the source, but Dr Nancy Klimas (well known me/cfs research figure) states that taking the two drugs together (for eg ceterizine h1 and famotidine h2) produces a 10-fold anti histamine effect, compared to taking one by itself. \n\r\nIt‚Äôs a relatively inexpensive and low risk thing to discuss with your doctor to trial if you have dysautonomia or mast cell type symptoms, MCAS doesn‚Äôt always present as anaphylactic type issues.\n\r\nI haven‚Äôt really required to take other things for MCAS other than PEA (palmitoylethanolamide) which is a stabiliser supplement and LDN. Addressing mast cells also helped to improve my hyperadregenic pots to an extent, and there is some research on the link between MCAS and dysautonomia. \n\r\nIf you do end up being responsive to MCAS drugs, the good news is there are [many different drug therapies to trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4903110/)\r\n\r\n**Managing IBS-C:**\r\nAnother co-morbidity with my ME that has been pretty prevalent for most of my life following the c diff infection in early childhood.\n\r\nBut I can‚Äôt stress enough how important it is to go to the bathroom regularly to prevent a build up of toxic metabolites produced by the gut microbiome into the body‚Äôs circulation. \n\r\nI had huge issues with gut motility when my Me became severe/very severe in my moldy house, so it‚Äôs imperative to find a way to address it if simple measures fail, such as being tested for a GI motility disorder like gastroparesis.\n\r\nIf this is an issue for you, a basic regime you can try to start with which works ok for me now, (besides managing all of the above) is magnesium oxide (iherb), liposomal vitamin c, lemon in warm water first thing in the morning, prunes, and psyllium husk powder.\r\n\r\n**Aggressive Rest/Pacing with help of a Garmin Watch**\r\n\r\nI get it, it‚Äôs pretty much near impossible to get quality rest when your ME is pretty bad, due to the nature of the illness and a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system. \n\r\nSo unless the neuroinflammation is being assisted in some way, it‚Äôs super hard.\n\r\nPacing is pretty much vital and the only real lifeline that we have, making the illness hell on earth. No matter what I took to relieve things, if I didn‚Äôt pace I would get nowhere and the medications rendered ineffective. \r\nI suspect I have adhd and im always super restless and find it impossible sometimes to be still and rest properly.\n\r\nOne tool that helped guide me with pacing a lot was a Garmin Vivoactive 4s watch (or any Garmin with HRV and body battery feature).\r\nheart rate measurements alone aren‚Äôt enough, it also tracks heart rate variability and then calculates a simple to understand ‚Äústress reading‚Äù from 0-100 which is measured and fluctuates each second. \n\r\nFor example - I could have a heart rate of 76 which looks low and under control, but my stress score at the same time could be 80 - which reads as in the ‚Äúhigh stress‚Äù range. It simply means your HRV is low, and that you need to stop what you‚Äôre doing when you can and slow things down.\n\r\nTo understand this concept better I need to also explain ‚Äúbody battery‚Äù and how it connects into ‚Äústress score‚Äù in terms of managing your activity levels for the day.\r\nI have a system in place where I don‚Äôt allow my body battery to get below 40 before bed, but everyone will be different depending on severity.\r\nSo shortly after I wake up and start my day, if I see my battery creeping near 60 and into the 50s, I slow things down and go to bed and lay flat for the next 3-4 hours, to allow the battery to recharge. The battery score will recharge when your stress score is consistently from 1-25 lying down, which is the blue or ‚Äúrest‚Äù range. Anything above that is in the orange colour and categorised as low, medium or high stress which depletes the battery, and obviously the higher the stress for a period of time, the faster the battery depletes. \n\r\nOn days in PEM, you will find that being in bed does not recharge your battery at all and even depletes because your stress score is not in the blue or ‚Äúrest‚Äù showing bad HRV. This is simply the sympathetic side of your autonomic nervous system primed and in action because of the physiological processes underpinning an ME crash. \r\n\r\nStill, having the stats in front of you is a helpful gauge to see if you can do a bit more that day, or you have to pull back and how much to pull back. It‚Äôs helped me avoid a lot of unnecessary PEM ‚Äì especially having assisted me in telling the difference between what energy is real and what is fake (running on adrenaline ‚Äì very important) and that gave me some confidence. Very severe ME patients will not see much in the blue at all even at rest, signalling that long term aggressive rest is required as well as further medical interventions with a good ME doctor. And of course, this does not track cognitive/mental exertion. \r\n\r\nThe main four things that helped me try and stay in the blue more often in order to get more quality/efficient rest on a physiological level: \r\nI. low carb small portion eating, \r\n\r\n2. better quality sleep (talk about this soon)\r\n\r\n3. identifying and managing all co-morbidities as best as possible (for example if my IBS-C is bad it will stimulate my HR), \r\n\r\n4. and of course pacing, if I don‚Äôt pace correctly my sleep will suffer, which is a hallmark PEM symptom.\r\n\r\nGarmin also offers an app called Garmin Connect, which also helps to log all your data and track worsening or improvement over time to validate how you‚Äôre feeling over a period.\r\n\r\n**Addressing sleep problems:**\r\n\r\nAlmost every one of us with ME have encountered sleep issues, whether it fluctuates in severity or is intermittently there.\n\r\nThis is something that improves very very slowly overtime when all or some of the above are looked into. For myself, after getting a lot of the neuro and systematic inflammation under control, the long term consistent sleep was like the process of cleaning up a city in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. \n\r\nBut it‚Äôs pretty much a crucial factor in determining whether or not you will see your condition improve in the long run.\r\nIdentifying and treating MCAS for one, was vital for me, which not only involves the use of medications and supplements, but also avoidance of triggers as best as possible (I can do a seperate post on MCAS if anyone is interested as info is quite complicated) -\r\nThis is due to the fact that When histamine levels are overblown and left unmanaged, it is a significant obstacle to better sleep - the body releases most of its histamine at around 2-3am, so take notice when you commonly wake mid-sleep, it could be a sign of unidentified and unmanaged mast cell issues. Before all of this I had frequent insomnia.\r\n\r\nEven now despite my improvement, if I have one night of bad sleep, my nervous system and POTS goes nuts, and I just feel my ability to function and do my chores for the day is very low. \r\n\r\nWhat do I personally recognise as bad sleep? It‚Äôs not always laying in bed awake. My Garmin watch tracks the amount of REM, Deep Sleep, light sleep, and time awake via heart rate and movement tracking, and refreshes the data for me to view in the morning. With 8 hours sleep, a bad sleep would look something like <2hrsREM and <30mins deep. Based on personal observation, Anything above that is considered decent and I don‚Äôt feel like too much of a zombie the next day.\r\n\r\nI still use a number of sleep aids. My first line approach is taking 1mg of melatonin, and if that doesn‚Äôt work and I feel some inflammation in my body (which is a significant disruptor of sleep), I take [CytoQuel - a supplement from Researched Nutritionals](https://www.researchednutritionals.com/product/cytoquel-cytokine-support/) which contains various anti inflammatory ingredients such as curcumin, NAC, Resveratrol, and Black Tea Extract - which can help to tame neuroinflammation that keeps the brain in an awakened state. If all else fails, I take some Benadryl, but I try to use it very sparingly as even though it is a potent mast cell stabiliser, it has been linked to negative long term side effects such as dementia/Alzeihmers.\r\n\r\nI have not taken the following, but you may also want to look into something like guanfacine or clonidine as a sleep aid, which is commonly prescribed by sleep specialists to help take the nervous system into a more relaxed state.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs like a 1% everyday compounding approach and if you can at least have a consistent sleep schedule of the same time in bed everyday, using the warm display setting on phone to block blue light etc. in a year or two it could make the difference between dying after going outdoors for 5 mins to be able to sit out and tolerate for a little longer which I know for me anyhow, was something I dreamed about after not being outdoors for years. But again, it‚Äôs impossible to achieve this if other modalities aren‚Äôt managed well and inflammaton out of control. Took 4 years of treating those other things first and foremost, then the consistent sleep was attainable. \r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs fairly common to wake up feeling like absolute crap when your body finally starts to get consistent sleep at first, due to a new body system I‚Äôll discuss below under the LDN heading.\r\n\r\n**Very Low Dose Naltrexone:**\r\nThis was the final step that pushed me to where I am now, and I‚Äôm confident it would not have worked in the slightest if I had introduced this before everything else. \n\r\nI‚Äôve come to the realisation that LDN and its use for ME/CFS is very poorly understood by most doctors giving it for this purpose.\r\nHeard way too many stories of MDs starting patients that are sensitive to medications on 0.5mg, and wondering why the hell they became much worse temporarily, and for more severe people sometimes permanently.\r\n\r\nThere is new research out of Australia that LDN helps to boost/support the [glymphatic system, a system in the body that encourages drainage of waste and other compounds from the brain which too much of are theorised to play a role in contributing to the onset of neurological diseases such as MS and Alzheimers](https://www.mcmc-research.com/post/the-glymphatic-system).\r\n\r\nThis is also thought to be why LDN can calm down glial over- activity in the brain, which is why some patients report improvements in light and sound sensitivities, overall fatigue and sense of wellbeing.\n\r\nBut I‚Äôve found that just like detoxification with my mold illness, ‚Äútoo much, too soon‚Äù, can have detrimental effects and strain the nervous system further, sending people to get worse. As Neil Nathan states in his book ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù patients have been told ever too often to push past herxheimer reactions in order to get to better health, but in patients with compromised mitochondria and energy system like ME, it is simply a dangerous exercise to push past negative effects for too long.\r\n\r\nI have severe medication sensitivity, and started on just 0.1mg of LDN, and had one of the worst crashes of my life, and only said I would persist for 10 days and stop taking it if there were no improvements in that period - luckily the crash was short lived and I am permanently staying on 0.2MG now, where I feel my energy has improved decently, with nausea associated with sound and light sensitivities ‚Äì mostly gone. I can also eat high histamine foods again that used to be problematic with MCAS. \n\r\nThere is also a concept of LDN usage called ‚ÄúULDN‚Äù short for ultra low dose, where you would start as low as 0.01mg.\r\nI encourage anyone that‚Äôs ready willing and able to start LDN to join an LDN Facebook group, there are great communities with experts to help you with the scary experience of getting on. (theres a lot of good advice here too).\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs very different to most other drugs, where less is more usually. Doctors are all trying to get patients to the 4.5mg instead of acknowledging the truth that everyone has a different optimal dose.\n\r\nBut again, it doesn‚Äôt work for everybody and was more of a last line therapy for me when I had taken care of a lot of other things, I doubt it would have been effective had I not addressed mold which was a huge problem leading to a consistently unchecked inflammatory response. \r\nBear in mind a lot of the scientific studies done that prove ldn does not work are having very sensitive patients on super high doses, which can mitigate any positive effect on a sensitive person with ME . There is a large study pending out of Griffith University in Queensland Australia. \r\n\r\n**A Note on CCI:**\r\nMy CCI seemed so severe for many years that I was fearful and was 100% convinced that the fusion surgery done by Jeff Wood And Jen Brea was the only way out to better days. \r\n\r\nWhenever I would stand up, it felt like I Could not hold my head up without it sinking forward, creating excruciating feeling of tension, disequilibrium, jaw pain, vision issues, choking sensation during sleep and the feeling of impending doom the longer I stayed out of bed, which would signal oncoming brutal PEM. \r\nIt felt as though my body was constantly attacking the delicate connective tissue structures at the base of my skull, and it was one of the worst feelings in the world that took me from mild/moderate to very severe me. If I sat on a long car ride to the doctor without a collar, I would have the worst PEM I‚Äôve ever felt and be bed bound for weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter my first covid shot, the inflammatory response was so bad that I was basically begging my parents to find the money to help me travel to Spain to have surgery with Dr Gilete, who had recently diagnosed me with possible CCI and confirmed AAI via a remote consultation as he looked through and took measurements of my upright MRI.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm here to tell you that despite all of this traumatic experience, I haven‚Äôt thought about the surgery once in the last year.  \r\nOn a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being worst), The associated symptoms improved from about a 8-9 to a 3-4. \r\nIf I went and jogged tomorrow I would definitely disrupt the instability, as power walks and landing my feet hard on the concrete outdoors has triggered some of it back temporarily, (as well as get shaky from increased MCAS in summer temperatures) however, I can live within my means now without it crossing my mind so it seems a lot more stable, and strong due to inflammation staying away from that area for a long time, so I really feel just finding a way to turn down or dampen the inflammation to your unique personal situation is the current best method for this unless it is mechanically so bad that surgery is the only option (which is rare and comes with significant risks).\r\n\r\nAs part of mold illness and some other inflammatory causes, there is a biomarker called ‚ÄúMMP-9‚Äù or \r\n‚ÄúMatrix metalloproteinase-9‚Äú which was quite high in my bloodwork when my CIRS was really bad. Since treating, and my neck feeling somewhat relieved, the levels are well within the normal range. [MMPs, in concert with other host proteinases and glycanases, destroy proteoglycans, collagens and other structural ECM molecules]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41584-023-00966-w#:~:text=in%20all%20arthropathies.-,MMPs%2C%20in%20concert%20with%20other%20host%20proteinases%20and%20glycanases%2C%20destroy,and%20receptor%20molecules%20and%20thereby)\r\nThere is also some [ongoing research]( https://thismighthelp.de/doxycycline/) that low dose doxycycline can help bring those levels down, there are studies in the above link which may be something worth considering to show your doctor if you have instability. At the low dosages, it has no anti microbial effects on the gut, just as an immune system modulator. \r\n\r\nTreating MCAS is also pivotal as that is a well known contributor to cci and collagen degradation, [as spoken about by well known neurosurgeon Dr Paolo Bolognese in a presentation](https://postimg.cc/5YHb3DWz). Mast cells do not just release histamine, but several other dangerous inflammatory mediators into circulation such as cytokines, prostaglandins etc. which can all cause damage to joints tendons and ligaments. \r\n\r\nFor anyone that may be wondering, I have not trialled regenerative medicine to address the remaining leftover damage such as prolotherapy, PRP etc. as even though it is available in my country (outside the US), I have personally made the decision not to as it is far too dangerous for a professional that is not too literate on cci/AAI to inject anything into c0/c1 or c1/c2 - which are proximally too close to vital structures such as the brainstem which can invoke more serious long term consequences. There are clinics in the USA more experienced with cci that I would rather take a gamble on sometime in the future. Besides, even if you had regenerative therapy done, if your inflammatory mediators are still firing away and out of control, chances are your repair work will be undone in a short time, and money down the tube. It‚Äôs something to potentially look at down the line once that part gets better\r\n\r\n\r\n**A note on FMT/Probiotics and Antibiotics:**\r\n\r\nA very interesting topic that is garnering more attention in medical research. There have been some profoundly eye opening discoveries in regards to the gut microbiome in recent years, including the existence of a ‚Äúgut-brain axis‚Äù, whereby the bacteria in our guts are a factory for the production of neurotransmitters that can flow up to our brain, which could be a major driving factor towards psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression, as well as neuroimmune illness. When you say ‚ÄúI have a gut feeling‚Äù, it‚Äôs quite literal in some way.\r\n\r\nOther facts associated with the gut microbiome include the immune system ‚Äì where 70% of our immune cells are manufactured in the gut, and 95% of the body‚Äôs serotonin. Certain bacteria in the gut can create other neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, adrenaline, GABA, etc. and almost play a role of orchestra for the picture that we know as our health. \r\nIt also explains why there are wildly varying stories of improvements (and worsening) associated with BOTH probiotic and antibiotic use, since they both alter the gut microbiome in some way. \r\n\r\nWhen I had my FMTs for colitis, I decided to take some more during the initial phase of my ME/CFS onset, when I was starting to lose hope that I could continue working and lose income due to the severe crashes that would result. Full time became part time, and part time was beginning to look dire after a while.\r\n\r\nAfter about 7 FMTs from a good donor, my energy was through the roof and allowed me to continue working with minimal PEM ‚Äì but sadly, the effects were short lived for 6 months and I reverted back to baseline and eventually had to stop work altogether.\r\n\r\nDuring my vaccine reaction in 2021, I shifted to the worst state I had been in my life and was borderlining on being a profound ME patient. I was prescribed ivermectin by my gastroenterologist to take for 10 days and miraculously I was back to baseline and walking freely again after 3 days of taking. I took it at a later time once a week and noticed a shift in my microbiome in that I had better moods, less inflammation and tolerated more foods that I was intolerant to prior.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm mentioning all of this not for the purpose to tell you to trial all of this, because it could have easily swung the other way and I was on the good end of the luck spectrum. The point in case that I‚Äôm trying to make is everyone has their own unique microbiome signature, and what antibiotic or probiotic helped me by chance could severely hurt another patient. The science of this is completely in its infancy, a lot has been discovered but even more is yet to be identified, kind of like space beyond earth. Thousands of unidentified bacteria, viruses etc. and how they all interconnect to support or falter bodily processes.\r\nIf you are recommended any of this, please be very weary towards the risks. If you have the finances, it can be worthwhile to do a GI-MAP test to see what your gut microbiome composition is, as there are several notes in the analysis that can help in which way to tackle things, but again the research is in the infant stages and nothing is guaranteed. \n\r\nFMT is great and low risk if the clinic is reputable (especially if you have IBS with ME), however most doctors would only advise it if you had a life threatening infection like me (c-diff 99% cure rate), due to the relative unknowns. Earlier in the post I referred to it saving my life as a child, but also introducing new problems which could have very well contributed to the onset of MCAS later in my life. But a promising topic for ME researchers to look into due to the ability to have a paradigm shift by manipulating your microbiome environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Well that‚Äôs a wrap from me, the post is already a bit too long.**\r\n\r\nI understand that this post most likely doesn‚Äôt apply to the profound patients, many of those who are even too sick to read and type on the ME subreddit. My deep sympathies are with you and your families, just because you‚Äôre not here, you‚Äôre not forgotten. \r\n\r\nAlso, due to the cyclical nature of me/cfs, I realise this improvement could be short lived. Not to mention that not all of you belong to this ME subset I am in. But while it‚Äôs not a complete recovery story, I am feeling happy with my current state after being on the very severe end of the spectrum. \r\n\r\nI just feel part of my purpose now is to give back to the community that gave to me, I‚Äôm forever grateful for all of the information shared as well as bonds developed during a super rough time in my life. Hopefully the info gathered during my journey is useful in some way, Will get back to all questions you may have and my DM‚Äôs are open. \r\n\r\r\n\r\nLastly, a special thanks to my beautiful Mum for helping to be my carer all of these years and also support me mentally while dealing with adversity of her own. And a shout out to everyone in the community living with shitty parents, I will never understand those that will not fight for their children and I just wanna say I see you and hope you improve overtime. \r\n\r\nTake care everyone\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\nWhere I was (2017-2023)\r\nNo Music: more than 10 seconds would feel overwhelmed by simultaneous layers of the song - instrumental, vocals , melody etc\r\n\r\nTV- the worst offender, the music sound effects and motion of the video used to make me nauseous, weak, brain irritation and MCAS \r\n\r\nNo phone calling and minimal speech.\r\n\r\nupright walking: not able to be up more than an hour at a time \r\n\r\n300 steps a day, 20 hours in bed/ day\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere I am: (2023-2024)\r\nCan listen 2-3 hours per day music  with no issues at all. \r\n\r\nnow can watch full basketball games, watch movies in 30 min spurts and even play video games\r\n\r\ncan do phone calls now and be upright 6-8 hours daily\r\n\r\n3000-4000 steps a day without PEM\r\n\r\n\r\n\rWhat helped:\r\nPacing using Garmin watch, Mold avoidance and treatment, identifying/managing MCAS and other co-morbidities (IBS/dysautonomia/CCI), very low LDN, post inflammation phase I followed up with sleep optimisation.

        "body": "thanks for posting. Your post has given me a lot of new ideas for areas to explore. posts like yours are literally the only reason I'm still a part of this subreddit. My story is very similar to yours, but i haven't recovered as much, yet (canadian medical system is as fast as an iceberg).\n\nI've gone from severe to right between mild/moderate with a few different issues still waiting to be treated but have been at this quality of life for 2 years now. It's wild seeing how similar our outlooks/experiences are on these different areas. My meaningful improvements came after similar measures to yours. I still have untreated mild cci, possible mcas, possible lyme, and a few other things but I did tethered cord surgery, cut out gluten/dairy/high sugar food, decreased portion sizes, among 100+ other things I tried (most things didn't work or made me worse). My LDN dose is 10mg because i found i had to keep increasing it to be effective, but I'm an outlier there. I think I'll eventually make a post similar to yours when I'm more in the mild/fully in remission category, but I'm not quite there yet.\n\nI have ONE suggestion it sounds like you're not doing that might be helpful for you like its been helpful for me: barefoot walking. Not wearing padded shoes forces you to use an additional axle of support (ball of your foot), and it reduces pain in your neck dramatically more than padded shoes ever can. It took me months to get used to but has been huge for me. My neck has been showing substantial improvements even without surgery/regenerative medicine. Theres a few people that do research in that area specifically outlying the benefits if you're interested: christopher mcdougall, daniel lieberman.

One of those was the ASIHC that I'd seen so many rave reviews about (and for the record, I'm pleased with the results after my 1st application). Nothing, here on SCA or on other sites/forums, had posted a warning about removal of the clay. However, during the removal process my fianc√© had the sudden realization that he was /pretty/ sure bentonite clay was the clumping agent in cat litter. \n\nICYDK, you don't flush dirty cat litter because the clay in most litters will clog your plumbing. That clay is usually bentonite. So, if you're just washing ASIHC off in the sink/shower/bath, you're risking huge clogs forming in your plumbing. We ended up just heating a large bowl of water, washing off in the bowl, and dumping the grey water outside. \n\nIs this a commonly known thing I had managed to somehow completely, and inexplicably, miss? How is everyone else removing and disposing of their mask?",

    "body": "I was doing some research about elevated mercury levels and really went down the rabbit hole of heavy metal toxicity in the body.\n\nI did a full write up but here's the summary. Let me know what I've missed. Would love to know more about this beyond my own research\n\n.\n\n**How Heavy Metals Got In Your Body**\n\nMercury is found in certain fish and dental amalgams and is linked to neurological conditions, fatigue, and immune dysfunction. Larger fish tend to have higher mercury levels, while smaller fish like sardines and anchovies have the lowest levels.\n\nArsenic is found in groundwater, rice, apples, and many pesticides. High levels of arsenic can be found in non-organic rice and apples from China. Arsenic exposure increases the risk of cancer, skin conditions, and heart disease.\n\nAluminum is linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and is found in antiperspirants, cookware, and processed foods.\n\nLead is found in older homes with lead-based paint and pipes, contaminated soil, and some food products. Lead exposure can cause brain damage, kidney damage, and nerve system damage, and is particularly harmful to children.\n\nCadmium is found in batteries, cigarettes, and some food, and it weakens bones and kidneys.\n\n.\n\n**Heavy Metal Toxicity Warning Signs**\n\nHeavy metals can cause inflammation in the brain and nervous system, disrupt mitochondrial function, irritate the gut lining, trigger autoimmune conditions, exacerbate respiratory issues, disrupt hormonal balance, and increase the risk of cancer and autism.\n\nFatigue, brain fog, headaches, digestive issues, trouble sleeping, and joint pain can be signs of a toxic load in the body.\n\nI appreciate these are wide-ranging and could be influenced by issues away from heavy metals. This is why testing is an important step.\n\n.\n\n**How To Test For Heavy Metal Toxicity**\n\nWhen testing for heavy metals look for non-spot tests to avoid acute spikes that could provide adverse results.\n\nLook for accredited lab tests (CLIA-certified is the standard in the US).\n\nBlood tests primarily detect recent or ongoing exposure to heavy metals ‚Äî especially lead and mercury.\n\nUrine tests detect metals excreted through the kidneys (e.g., arsenic, cadmium). Ensure these are 24hr tests.\n\nHair mineral tests detect concentrations of heavy metals in hair strands over a period of weeks to months. Important to avoid contamination (such as shampoos).\n\n.\n\n**Steps To Remove Heavy Metals**\n\nStudies show that chlorella detoxifies the body of heavy metals like cobalt, strontium, barium, and thallium.\n\nCilantro helps bind to heavy metals and stimulates liver function.\n\nInfrared sauna use can facilitate the elimination of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury through sweat.\n\nHerbs like garlic, milk thistle, cilantro, ginkgo biloba, and turmeric can also stimulate the body‚Äôs detoxification of heavy metals.\n\n.\n\n**Long-Term Behaviors To Reduce Bodily Heavy Metals**\n\nLimit exposure to heavy metals by filtering drinking water, switching to stainless steel and glass cookware, and choosing natural, aluminum-free deodorants and cosmetics.\n\nDietary optimisation includes consuming organic meat, wild-caught fish (especially salmon and mackerel), grass-fed beef, liver, steamed organic vegetables, organic fruit, and high-fiber foods.\n\nCertain supplements like zeolites, apple pectin, bentonite clay, dandelion, and N-acetylcysteine can aid in detoxification.\n\nSweat detoxication can be heightened through cardiovascular training or sauna use.",

My Lithium, Arsernic, Cadmium, and Mercury all looked great.  Lead was reasonable too: not quite as good but still within the \"okay\" range.  Zinc, copper, magnesium all looked good, but my iodine was too low.  I repeated an iodine serum test from LifeExtension and got the same result, so this was useful test.  I now realize this is because I almost never use table salt.  I lightly supplement iodine transdermally now. \n\nAnyone else test other things, through which provider and why?",

(*Hint: it‚Äôs not usually just a guy with a digger.*) \n* Are short-term costs worthy of the long-term gain?  \n \n\nIn today‚Äôs post, [Spiral Ridge Permaculture](http://www.spiralridgepermaculture.com/)'s  Cliff Davis, a southeastern permaculture design expert, consultant,  lecturer, homesteader and ‚Äúapplied farming ecologist,‚Äù will guide you  through everything you need to know about installing a pond on your  near-perfect piece of land.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### The Significance and Far-Reaching Benefits of Ponds\n\nPermaculture design has become infamous in drought-ridden  regions, such as Australia and the Middle East, for restoring barren  landscapes to fertile oases through specific systems of water capturing,  planting and other land design and animal management principles.\n\nCliff describes his role in permaculture design as, ‚ÄúDesigning  regenerative human settlements that mimic nature and the intelligence  behind ecosystems. As a permaculture designer, I use the land‚Äôs ecology  and eco-intelligence to design more effective and resilient farm  systems.‚Äù\n\n**Here‚Äôs how it relates to building a beautiful, fertile, functional pond.** \n\n‚ÄúWhen most people think of a pond‚Äôs purpose, they think of them  for fishing, irrigation, or watering livestock‚Äîwhich is their primary  function in the southeast.‚Äù\n\nBut, according to Cliff, a permaculture-designed pond, or  system of ponds, can offer so much more to both the land and its  inhabitants.\n\n‚ÄúProperly designed and positioned ponds create microclimates  within a property. They help humidify the landscape‚Äîwater holds a lot of  heat, so if you can have a pond ecosystem near your orchards or your  house you can stabilize more of the environment around those areas and  even prevent frost and delay flowering in spring.‚Äù\n\nCliff also explains that besides creating remarkable  microclimates, ponds help create biodiversity by recharging the ground  water table and providing habitat for frogs and wildlife that help keep  the ecosystem in check. \n\nPonds positioned on slopes (known as ridge dams) can also help  sustain your land and livestock during times of drought (a memory fresh  in the minds of Southern landowners everywhere).\n\n‚ÄúWhen you begin to view the significance of a pond from this  perspective, it helps you start to think about how many functions you  can get out of this thing you‚Äôre about to spend thousands of dollars  on.‚Äù\n\nNow that your mind is beginning to brim with possibilities,  let‚Äôs take a look at Cliff‚Äôs step-by-step tips for successful pond  integration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Step 1: Decide what function(s) your pond will serve\n\nBefore you start dreaming about your pond‚Äôs location, landscaping or size, Cliff recommends asking yourself the big question: *Why do I really want a pond, now and in the future?*\n\n‚Äú**You don‚Äôt want to just build a pond, you want to build an eco-system.**  You can irrigate and water livestock from a pond, but you can also use  it to create an aquaculture, raise geese, fish, mitigate drought and  create microclimates. So there‚Äôs a lot to consider in the function of  your pond.‚Äù\n\nTake some time to carefully consider and research your big WHY before you start calling up contractors. \n\nThis will determine a number of crucial design aspects such as  the pond‚Äôs ideal location, size, expert advice required and the type of  aquaculture you want to create.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Step 2: Determine whether or not your land and soil are suited for a pond\n\nThough a pond can be installed on nearly any type of land, your soil has to be compatible or the water won‚Äôt hold. \n\nCliff refers to soil that holds water as ‚Äúplastic soil.\"\n\nIn the Southeast most of us have clay, which is ideal for  ponds, but if your property has sandy, rocky, or dispersive soil you may  have to truck in clay such as bentonite clay, which gets expensive.\n\n‚ÄúAt that point you have to do a cost-benefit analysis to see if  it‚Äôs really worth it for the long-run, because there are other  water-capturing features you can consider.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhether or not your land is suited for a pond also depends on  what kind of usage you want out of it. If you want to gravity feed water  with piping for irrigation using a ridge dam (a pond positioned mid to  mid-high slope), then having gentle hills is a must.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe best landscape is where you can get the most uses.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Step 3: Do your due diligence (and avoid the biggest mistake aspiring pond owners make)\n\nAs a permaculture design consultant, Cliff has been called in to assess and fix a lot of ponds-gone-wrong.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a couple-acre pond built that didn‚Äôt hold water. If  you can imagine that‚Äôs kind of like pumping a 500-foot well dry, and  that‚Äôs a major problem in the design process.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat I typically tell people is due diligence is the best thing you can do in the beginning.‚Äù \n\nCliff references one of his permaculture design mentors, Darren Doherty, co-author of the much-anticipated ‚Äú[The Regrarians Handbook](http://www.regrarians.org/)‚Äù, who explains **there are 28 steps to building a pond - and during the first 14 you‚Äôre not even digging.**\n\n‚ÄúManaging water on a landscape is one of the most important things we design for.‚Äù\n\nHere are 4 key tips to ensure you've done your due diligence before you build a pond:\n\n**1. Do ‚Äúdry-runs‚Äù with help from a professional**\n\n‚ÄúGet a hold of the [National Resources Conservation Service (NRSC)](http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/)  or your local extension office, find out who the geologist is and talk  to them about your soil and the possibility of putting in a pond in your  area. Do exploratory pits to see what the soil looks like. If it‚Äôs  rocky, then most likely it‚Äôs not going to work so well because you can‚Äôt  build a pond with dispersive soil.‚Äù\n\n**2. Consider rainfall AND watershed**\n\nThough rainfall is an important consideration, Cliff emphasizes  you must also account for watershed when determining the best location  for your pond. \n\nWatershed is an area of land that feeds all the water running  under it and draining off of it into a body of water on your land. In  this case that body of water is your pond site.\n\n‚ÄúYou have to do a study of the area and the watershed that is  going to be filling up the pond. That‚Äôs very important, because I‚Äôve  seen ponds that don‚Äôt fill up because there‚Äôs not enough watershed to  fill that size pond, so you have to size your pond accordingly.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd you have to build the spillways (for overflow) to be able  to handle a lot of water coming out, like a 100 year flood, so it  doesn‚Äôt spill over the back of the dam wall. Those have to be designed  and built very well.‚Äù\n\n**3. Want a clean, clear and full pond? Beware of trees.**\n\n‚ÄúThe other thing I notice when ponds won‚Äôt hold water is they have a lot of the trees growing on the backside of the dam wall.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good, because the trees will either wick the water  from the pond or can cause capillaries from the backside of the dam into  the pond leading to multiple drainage issues. Then if the tree dies,  the roots die, causing a piping network that can drain water.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you want the pond to hold water and for that water to be  clean, then it‚Äôs best not to have trees around the dam wall at all (no  pun intended).‚Äù\n\n**4. Don‚Äôt forget to check on legalities**\n\nIn most areas there are legal restrictions on how close your  dam or pond can be built to an existing creek, stream, river, reservoir,  etc. Ignore these to your peril because you could get sued.\n\nThen there‚Äôs the what-if factor, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recommend building a  big dam wall up above your house. If you have your house on a slope with  the dam above it and the dam wall breaches it could completely destroy  what‚Äôs beneath it. And you have to consider your neighbors too.‚Äù\n\nYou also need to research permits, review your insurance policy  and determine whether or not your pond will be used for fire  protection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Step 4: Finding and hiring your pond building and design team\n\nThough you may think you can just hire a machine operator to  dig a hole (or dig it yourself), you may need to consult with  contractors, designers, operators, geologists, insurance agents and even  engineers before you break ground.\n\n‚ÄúFirst, find the portfolio of the contractor who‚Äôs going to build this thing.  You‚Äôre paying someone $100-$150 an hour so you want to know exactly  what they plan to do to your land and what they‚Äôve done in the past.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAsk them questions like: Do you know what freeboard is on a  pond (that‚Äôs the difference between the water level and the still weight  on the dam wall)? Do they know about keying in a dam? How do they build  the dams? I highly recommend studying and researching how dams are  supposed to be built for yourself.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSometimes the scale of the pond will demand different  consultants or different people working on it. If your pond will be more  than 2-3 acres you may have to hire hydrological engineers‚Äîand  remember, **engineers don‚Äôt cost you money - they save you money.‚Äù**\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in implementing permaculture design  principles into your landscape, a regional design expert like Cliff can  provide a wealth of knowledge and recommendations for your unique land.\n\nThough there are DIY options for pond building, Cliff recommends getting help when you need it:\n\n‚ÄúEven though DIY is kind of my MO, I would say don‚Äôt be too  cheap to hire the right people to help you. You‚Äôre making a major change  to your landscape that you‚Äôre going to have to live with forever, plus  ponds are very costly to fix if they‚Äôre not installed right in the first  place.‚Äù\n\nBottom line, be your own advocate in researching the specifics  of building your pond, but seriously consider seeking help from the  experts when it comes to the physical task of building it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Step 5: Introduce plants and wildlife carefully\n\n‚ÄúFirst of all, keep ducks off your pond at first (using  fencing) because they‚Äôll consume all the plant material that wants to  grow in there.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs soon as the pond‚Äôs built you need to get some really good  perennial grass, like fescue, on the backside of the dam wall. You want  to get that covered and mulched right away to help stop any erosion of  the wall.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou can start planting aquatics on the edges. Contact your  fish and wildlife department for help determining stocking rates, and I  highly recommend talking to your local extension agent for advice and  options.‚Äù\n\nCliff also warns against letting cattle or other livestock walk  directly into your pond at any stage in its life, as this destroys the  aquatic life and introduces bacteria and parasites that disrupt and  pollute the pond‚Äôs eco-system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Ponds within a sustainable water infrastructure\n\nFor farmers interested in using a pond or ponds to capture and  utilize water sustainably, Cliff emphasizes it is important to view them  as only one piece (albeit an important piece) of your water  infrastructure.\n\n‚ÄúThere are multiple ways to capture and recycle water, such as  cisterns off of your barns that collect run-off, grazing your animals  better and building topsoil faster so it can hold water in the system.  So when you think of water don‚Äôt just think of ponds, think of using  them within a tool belt of water infrastructure.‚Äù\n\nAs you can see, integrating a successful pond into your  landscape involves a lot more than just digging a hole and figuring out  how to fill it. It takes research, planning, strategic design,  investment and team work. \n\nBut when built the right way for the right reasons, a pond can  offer beauty, recreation and sustainable functionality to your perfect  piece of land.\n\nTo learn more about Cliff and his permaculture courses and  workshops, upcoming lectures, permaculture and pond design consulting,  internships, and his farm visit: [www.spiralridgepermaculture.com](http://www.spiralridgepermaculture.com/). \n\nFurther reading: To learn more about designing and building your ultimate pond, Cliff recommends: [www.regrarians.org](http://www.regrarians.org/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Article Source](https://rethinkrural.raydientplaces.com/blog/how-to-build-a-pond-or-lake-on-your-property)",

typical coffee is now grown in the sun and is a leading cause of different types of pollution, deforestation, massive water usage, and cheap labor done by the global south. shade grown coffee, however, is the traditional way of growing coffee, these ‚Äúfarms‚Äù mimic forests and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and taste so much better! here‚Äôs a great video about the disastrous effects typical coffee has: https://youtu.be/Dp8ol4RRRiA (this channel is amazing)\n\n- if decaf is your thing and you like dates, save the seeds from dates, follow a simple recipe for date seed coffee. it tastes just like coffee, just a bit nuttier and sweeter, and has no trace of caffiene like decaf coffee does.\n\n- make food at home more often\n\n\n- dumpster diving baby. corporate stores that sell anything sometimes throw out hundreds of items a week for various reasons. you can often find food, clothes, and countless other items in these dumpsters, they are often bagged separately from trash and the items themselves are packaged, its not a gross thing like its often portrayed. you can bask in the luxury of enjoying products from large corporations without supporting them in any way, give these things out to people who need them for free, and stop these things from rotting in a landill. many people are able to avoid buying food entirely. for maximum luck keep track of where, what day and what time you were able to score. check out r/dumpsterdiving\n\n\n- grow some crops! no matter where you live, you can grow plants or even build highly efficient garden, indoors or outdoors\n\n\n- plant species that are native to your location to support the environment\n\n\n- if you live on a property with a yard, you can designate your lawn as a certified national wildlife habitat by providing a few things for native species, here‚Äôs a link on how: https://bellevuewa.gov/sites/default/files/media/pdf_document/backyard_wildlife_habitat.pdf\n\n\n- when eating out, eat in to avoid plastic takeout containers\n\n\n- bring your own containers when eating out for leftovers, or keep some in your car at all times\n\n\n- make your own products if able, stuff like toothpaste, deoderant, soap, makeup, etc\n\n\n- ecobrick if you have the time! ecobricking is where you cut clean plastic up into pieces about half the size of your finger and shove the pieces in a hard soda bottle (sprite, gatorade bottle, no flimsy water bottles). with the back of a wooden spoon. it gets so dense its similar to a brick, you can drop it off at a location that accepts them or ship them off, these bricks are used to build furniture, houses and schools! or you can use these to build yourself\n\n\n- download Too Good To Go, its a great app where places that sell food can give out food that wouldve gone in a landfill at the end of the day. these surprise bags usually go for $2-$5.\n\n\n- if you are confident enough (or if you work at one of these places), you can go to any place that sells food near you, and ask if they throw out food at the end of the day. if they do you can ask to speak to the manager and tell them about the app Too Good To Go. food stores can list ‚Äúbags‚Äù in any time frame that suits them for a discounted price. so they are still making a profit but simultaneously helping disadvantaged people by giving them fresh food at a heavily discounted price, instead of it going into the trash.",

Bought me a 2lb bag as a gift, when we talk on the phone she's always encouraging me to make face masks, bathe in it, consume it in smoothies. It cures everything and it's better than medicine because you don't know what companies and pharmacies put in medicine, they're just trying to make money off us. Don't ask how we know and trust the company that put clay into this bag of clay, because that company is definitely NOT trying to make money off anyone. The logic is beyond me. I think to myself, I guess I have clay masks for the rest of my life bc I'm not eating this shit. Tell her thanks for the gift and move on.\n\nThrough a random series of clicks (a family member sent me a link for Watch the Water, which I had never heard of and subsequently googled what it's about, bc f\\*\\*\\* if I click that link). I learn that the water supplies of our country are being poisoned with snake venom (news to me) and see a list of (familiar) things that cure and protect you. Zinc.  Ivermectin. Hydroxychloroquine. Vitamin C. Bentonite clay. Wait a second, bentonite clay is involved in Qanon conspiracies? Further looking shows me that it doesn't just cure snake venom, it can also \"detox the vaxx\". Maybe I'm late to the party learning about this.\n\nI now believe that she has been secretly trying to \"de-vaccinate\" my sister and I by encouraging us to use bentonite clay PROFUSELY. She's never been someone that gave gifts as gifts, so it's actually not surprising that there was an ulterior motive. Just... sigh.",

I did some research and suspected some kind of GI issue (I feel like I‚Äôve always had stomach problems my whole life, I‚Äôm 26). \n\nAfter the test came back and I was positive for candida. My FMD recommended I do a candida cleanse by lowering my sugar and carb intake, along with taking grapefruit seed extract (which is a great anti-fungal agent). I took the grapefruit seed extract for the entire month of august and pretty much just did low carb, low sugar. After my supply was done, I didn‚Äôt notice much of a change. So I decided to get serious and kick this cleanse into overdrive.\n\nI didn‚Äôt actually start any kind of true protocol to heal myself until early October of 2020 when I wanted this sluggish feeling to go away. From there, I went straight to NO SUGAR, & LITTLE TO NO CARBS for a whole month. I Followed with a powder from Quicksilver Scientific called the Ultra Binder that includes Activated Charcoal, Bentonite Clay, aloe, & chitosin. I didn‚Äôt drink any alcohol, I stopped including any fermentable foods in my diet like vinegar, I stopped taking my probiotics, I took about 2-3 tbsp of coconut oil daily, and I did daily intermittent fast. \n\nWhen my binder detox ran out, I SLOWLY started to incorporate fermented foods back into my diet. I still didn‚Äôt do any sugar but i went from no carbs to low carbs & continued that same routine for about an additional 2 months with everything from above. I included small amounts of alcohol here and there. This whole process took about 3-4 months of some strict diligent restoration of my gut. \n\nI noticed I started to feel a lot more energetic in late January, early February of 2021. My GI distress was slim to none and I could eat food without feeling bloated or gassed. \n\nI ordered another stool test through my physician around that time and the test results came back negative! She was very surprised and very happy for me. I went from a 75% Dysbiotic gut flora down 0%! \n\nCandida is in all of us, but it only becomes a problem when it grows out of control. So if you‚Äôre suffering from some of the same issues I was, i understand completely but understand that you can heal yourself through yourself, without any pharmaceuticals that usually give you nasty side effects. \n\nGood luck on your journey, the struggle of how strict a candida diet can be will be well worth it.",

    "body": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- Michigan's environmental agency said Friday it has approved construction of an underground tunnel to house a replacement for a controversial oil pipeline in a channel linking two of the Great Lakes.\n\nThe decision, a victory for Enbridge Inc., comes as the Canadian company resists Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's demand to shut down its 68-year-old line in the Straits of Mackinac.\n\nEnbridge disputes her claim -- echoed by environmentalists and native tribes -- that the pipeline segment crossing the 4-mile-wide (6.4-kilometre-wide) waterway is unsafe. But Enbridge had earlier sought to ease public concern by striking a deal with Whitmer's predecessor, Republican Rick Snyder, in 2018 to run a new pipe through a tunnel to be drilled beneath the straits connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.\n\nThe project requires permits from the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Liesl Clark, director of the Michigan agency and a Whitmer appointee, said the company's application satisfied state legal requirements.\n\n\"We have issued permits designed to ensure that if a tunnel is constructed, it will be in strict compliance with relevant statutes and adhere to stringent protections against impacts to the Great Lakes,\" Clark said.\n\nEnbridge has pledged to cover all costs of the US$500 million project, which it says will be completed by 2024.\n\nThe tunnel \"will make a safe pipeline even safer,\" spokesman Ryan Duffy said, describing the permit approval as \"an important milestone\" for a project \"virtually eliminating the potential for any release from Line 5 into the straits.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups and tribes fighting to decommission Enbridge's Line 5, which transports oil and natural gas liquids used in propane between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, also oppose the tunnel. They say it would pollute the waters, harm fish and damage shoreline wetlands while boosting use of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.\n\nThe permit approval is \"a huge disappointment,\" said Liz Kirkwood, executive director of Traverse City-based For Love of Water, saying there was \"compelling evidence of significant environmental harm.\"\n\n\"There are much smarter alternatives to building a tunnel under the largest freshwater body on the planet,\" Kirkwood said, adding that the decision probably would draw legal challenges.\n\nState officials emphasized that the tunnel project was a separate legal matter from the dispute over the existing pipeline, which was laid in 1953. The underwater segment splits into two pipes, 20 inches (50.8 centimetres) in diameter, stretched across the bottom of the straits.\n\nCritics contend the pipes are vulnerable to a rupture that could contaminate Great Lakes waters and miles of shorelines, a hazard that became more urgent after a barge anchor was dragged across them in 2018, doing minor damage.\n\nWhitmer last fall ordered a shutdown of Line 5 by May, saying Enbridge repeatedly had violated an easement allowing pipeline operations in the straits. The company is challenging the order in federal court and said recently it would not comply.\n\nEnbridge insists the lines have never leaked and remain in good condition. It has taken steps to prevent future anchor strikes and says the tunnel project would eliminate that danger.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel unsuccessfully challenged in court a law authorizing the tunnel agreement that was enacted shortly before Snyder's term as governor expired.\n\nOpponents then urged rejection of permits for the project. Engineers who studied the company's application documents at the request of environmental groups said Enbridge hadn't taken enough core samples and that uneven bedrock formations could lead to boring machine breakdowns.\n\nThey also raised warned about potential collapse of the tunnel, methane leaks that could endanger workers, and bentonite clay used for lubrication and stability that could pollute the lakes and bottomlands if released.\n\nLeaders of the state environment department said they hired a consulting firm with tunneling expertise to assist a nine-month review of Enbridge's plans that included consideration of critics' objections.\n\nIt found the project would have \"minimal impact\" on water quality and wetlands, said Teresa Seidel, director of the department's Water Resources Division. State law didn't allow for consideration of the project's potential effects on climate change, she said.\n\nOne permit allows Enbridge to build the tunnel beneath submerged lands and to disturb wetlands on the north shore of the straits, where a road will be widened.\n\nAbout 0.13 wetland acres (0.052 hectares), an area the size of one-tenth of a football field, would be damaged. Enbridge will compensate by conserving 1.3 wetland acres (0.53 hectares) and supporting other protections.\n\nA second permit will regulate wastewater from the project, which will be treated at an onshore plant. About 1.4 million gallons (5.3 million litres) will be discharged daily into the lakes and will have to meet quality standards, including heat limitations, to protect fish and other aquatic life.\n\nEnbridge must notify the state if the plant exceeds 65 per cent of its operating capacity. If it hits 100 per cent, construction work will be halted.\n\nThe project still needs a Clean Water Act permit from the Army Corps. Among issues for federal consideration is the recent discovery of a possible underwater Native American cultural site in the area of the pipeline. The state permit requires avoidance of damage to such sites.\n\nAdditionally, the state Public Service Commission will decide whether to allow placement of the new pipe in the tunnel.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/enbridge-line-5-tunnel-approved-by-michigan-regulators-1.1556169",

I‚Äôve been down an uncountable amount of rabbit holes over the past 20 years and finally in 2019 I pulled it together, left religion, and started looking into the actual science behind some of the greatest mysteries of humankind. One of these ‚Äúmysteries‚Äù is the conspiracy of chemtrails.\n\nI bring up chemtrails specifically because I have a family member whom I talk to regularly and they just can‚Äôt help but bring this up. Every goddamn phone call turns into me being recommended to drink Borax, bathe with Bentonite Clay, and to make sure I have Black Salve on hand all to detox from the supposed chemtrail spraying.\n\nFunnily enough, I live in a part of the States where these so-called chemtrails are extremely elusive. So elusive, in fact, that they are virtually nonexistent. I also reside in a very hot climate and was told how Borax can help ‚Äúregulate‚Äù your body temperature which in turn can help you tolerate extreme heat and as an extra bonus it also makes you feel 20 years younger. Fucking really? Ah yes, it ‚Äúgoes back thousands of years..‚Äù Right..\n\nOne night in particular I was sent a somewhat cryptic message about some ancient magic book. So I gave this person my honest thoughts on ‚Äúmagic‚Äù and all hell broke loose. So I called them out for using fallacious arguments and I was called a ‚Äúhardcore atheist‚Äù and was told how close-minded I am. I‚Äôve never seen someone type so fast in my life. They demanded that I respond but kept right on typing and even went as far as attempting to predict how I was going to respond and then acted like they had won the argument. WTF!?\n\nWhen I called them out for using a straw man argument they denied what they said was in fact a straw man and then proceeded to inform me a straw man argument was when you give someone the ‚Äúrun-around‚Äù creating a question that has no answer. WTF!?\n\nIn the midst of their rage typing I had produced what I thought was a well thought out and reasonable response but at the end of it all I decided to not respond at all. I‚Äôm confident they felt as though they had won the day so I just let it be.\n\nMy legitimate question to you guys:\n\nIs it possible to educate a serious conspiracy theorist on how to be reasonable and how to come to good conclusions? I really feel like it‚Äôs possible after coming out of it myself but these people make me feel like I‚Äôm the one something is wrong with.",

Today is June 20, 2025, and I‚Äôm finally at the point where I can say I trust my instincts more than any specialist who brushed me off. If you‚Äôre struggling with something mysterious, I hope this helps you feel less alone‚Äîand more empowered to keep digging.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è The Symptoms No One Took Seriously\n\nFor years, I‚Äôve been dealing with a constellation of symptoms no one could explain:\n\t‚Ä¢\tLoud, constant buzzing in my brain (like cicadas or electricity)\n\t‚Ä¢\tBlack, tarry discharge from my ears\n\t‚Ä¢\tSevere sinus pressure, tightness near my skull base and neck\n\t‚Ä¢\tBrain fog, disassociation, anxiety, crying spells, night sweats\n\t‚Ä¢\tFlank pain I couldn‚Äôt explain for over a year and a half\n\t‚Ä¢\tStretch-mark-like rashes, wrinkling of skin in water, yellowing nails\n\t‚Ä¢\tMood crashes, emotional flatlining, and panic episodes that feel medical\n\nI‚Äôve been misdiagnosed with stress, anxiety, and even just ‚Äúmom burnout.‚Äù\nBut I knew something else was going on. And I had to fight for that knowing.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüß† My Gut Knew Before Anyone Else\n\nLike a post I recently read, something inside me just kept whispering,\n\n‚ÄúTest your body. Follow the thread. Don‚Äôt stop.‚Äù\n\nSo I did.\n\nI started uploading my labs and symptoms into ChatGPT. I mapped my life‚Äîsymptoms, stress, timelines, even emotional breakdowns‚Äîand realized something had been brewing for decades. Maybe since childhood. I had a seizure at 11 with no explanation. I swam in murky lakes, was raised in a home that was later renovated (with possible mold exposure), and lived in a high-humidity region.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüí° The Suspicions: Mold, Fungus, Biofilm & Blocked Detox\n\nAs I got sicker, I started building my own theory:\n\t‚Ä¢\tThis was a chronic fungal + bacterial colonization\n\t‚Ä¢\tIt was embedded in biofilm in places like my sinuses, ears, and lymph\n\t‚Ä¢\tIt was affecting my nervous system, mood, immune function, and skin\n\t‚Ä¢\tI might have MTHFR or COMT issues‚ÄîI don‚Äôt detox well\n\t‚Ä¢\tThe infection may have walled itself off in my skull base or Eustachian tube\n\nLike the woman who found mold in her ice machine, I started wondering:\n\n‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm still being exposed daily? What if it‚Äôs in my environment?‚Äù\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüß™ Relief That Told Me I Was Right\n\nEvery time I started treating it‚Äîjust intuitively‚ÄîI got some relief.\n\n‚úÖ When I used fluconazole, symptoms backed off\n‚úÖ Caprylic acid, oregano oil, apple cider vinegar, monolaurin, and berberine made the buzzing ease\n‚úÖ Pau d‚ÄôArco tea or extract made things move (literally loosened biofilm)\n‚úÖ Saline + iodine nasal rinses finally let things drain\n\nBut nothing stuck long‚Äîbecause like the Reddit post, I might still be actively exposed. I just haven‚Äôt found my ‚Äúice machine‚Äù yet.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What I‚Äôm Doing Now (My Personal Protocol)\n\nI‚Äôve had to treat myself like a science experiment while staying broke and uninsured. Here‚Äôs what I use in rotation:\n\nüíä Supplements & Tools\n\t‚Ä¢\tOregano oil caps\n\t‚Ä¢\tCaprylic acid\n\t‚Ä¢\tMonolaurin (1000 mg caps)\n\t‚Ä¢\tApple cider vinegar (caps or diluted shots)\n\t‚Ä¢\tBerberine\n\t‚Ä¢\tPau d‚ÄôArco tea/extract\n\t‚Ä¢\tIodine (Lugol‚Äôs, diluted for nasal use)\n\t‚Ä¢\tNAC (when tolerated)\n\t‚Ä¢\tMagnesium + potassium for nervous system calm\n\t‚Ä¢\tChlorophyll or spirulina\n\t‚Ä¢\tBinder rotation: activated charcoal, psyllium, sometimes bentonite clay\n\t‚Ä¢\tLumbrokinase (planning to rotate in)\n\nüåø Detox & Lifestyle\n\t‚Ä¢\tCold plunging (lymph support + inflammation)\n\t‚Ä¢\tInfrared sauna access (when possible)\n\t‚Ä¢\tScalp treatments (retinol worsened biofilm at times)\n\t‚Ä¢\tSerrapeptase (initially used, now rotating with Lumbrokinase)\n\t‚Ä¢\tCastor oil packs on liver + lymph\n\t‚Ä¢\tMold-free diet when I can: low sugar, no fermented foods, no grains\n\t‚Ä¢\tBleach baths for skin fungal control\n\t‚Ä¢\tNo retinol in squalane on face anymore‚Äîit worsened forehead symptoms\n\t‚Ä¢\tPrayer, journaling, and intuitive tracking‚Äîyes, seriously, it‚Äôs part of it\n\n‚∏ª\n\nüåÄ What I Know Now\n\nThis isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust in my head.‚Äù\nIt isn‚Äôt anxiety.\nIt isn‚Äôt burnout.\nMy body has been screaming the truth the entire time. And like the woman who said:\n\n‚ÄúI could have healed‚Äîif I hadn‚Äôt still been exposed.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¶I believe the same is true for me.\n\nIf you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre deep in the spiral of symptoms no one understands, please trust your gut. Document. Track. Use what tools you have. Listen to your body. The answer might be something hiding in plain sight.\n\n‚∏ª\n\nIf anyone wants to talk or trade ideas‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre dealing with the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù mystery, MCAS, chronic fungal infection, or sinus/Eustachian biofilm‚ÄîI‚Äôm here.\n\nYou‚Äôre not crazy. You‚Äôre just early.\n",

Well about a year of living here i started getting rashes, then i started getting melanoma spots. Yes! Melanoma spots. . Went to the derm, they did the surgery... About a few months later kept getting more ... About 2 years living here came headaches, dizziness, constipation AND diarrhea.. \n\nBrain fog, fast heart rate with palpitations, chest pains, the alice in wonderland feeling.... Joint pains, swollen occipital lymph node on the right side... And a myriad of other horrible symptoms... I went to the hospital 13 times since october of 2024 where they said it had to be anxiety or panic attacks. Blood work is all normal... But the anxiety diagnosis was BS to me because i know myself and i know my body... I hadn't seen a doctor prior for about 2 years because i felt fine before i moved into this house... We can't even leave this house currently because we exhausted all of our expenses.\n\nIts like my soul and body just knows that mold is the issue.. i see it in many spots and i just know. But cant afford a mycotoxin test because even those can be expensive... Im upset because my mother doesnt think mold can be serious but she herself was fine before moving into this house as well. \n\nIt definitely is a rocky road to travel on and i hope that we can get past this.",

I have:\n\n* detoxed without using antiperspirant or deodorant for 2 weeks\n* Used armpit masks multiple times - both a charcoal mask and Calcium Bentonite Clay Mask\n* Used an armpit detox exfoliating scrub from Ulta\n* Washed armpits every day with unscented soap, and shaved armpits every other day.\n* Tried every deodorant brand under the sun: Arm & Hammer, Native, BeautyCounter (yep - spent $30 on deodorant), Tom's, Schmidt's, a local brand that sells natural deodorant. I am currently trying Native's Sensitive formula. It's been two weeks and I stink after an hour or so.\n\nI have read blogs, articles, Reddit posts on tips/tricks about switching to deodorant. I know some folks say this change can take a while but 7 months? I want to stick with deodorant but I am really insecure about how I smell (I understand I will eventually smell after time, but I need a deodorant that can last me 5-7 hours, not 1). Last night I swiped on Native, put on a dress and went to a bar (I was standing with a group, not dancing or anything active). After an hour my dress was damp and I could smell my BO. I thought, \"That's it.. I'm done. Going back to antiperspirant\" because it's not worth feeling this bad about my body! I know once I use antiperspirant, the whole 7 months of work will be ruined so I thought I would check here before I throw in the towel.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? If so, what'd you do? If not, I am still open to any and all suggestions!! Thank you\n\n*Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind and thoughtful responses. I really appreciate all of the advice and knowledge shared on this post. Here is what I have done since I posted:*\n\n* *I bought Crystal Deodorant - snagged the last one at the store... boo-ya!*\n* *I ordered Routine samples online - emailed the folks and they gave me free samples. I only had to pay for shipping!*\n* *I bought Glycolic Acid, and it was gross, sticky and didn't help my Native sensitive deo any more or less. So I returned it and plan on getting the Ordinary brand and seeing how that works.*\n* *I do eat meat and dairy, and I am going to keep a food diary to track meat and dairy intake.*\n* *I already drink tons of water a day - over 100 ounces but a very good thing to mention as some people don't drink water at all*\n* *I will try the crystal and the Routine, and if both fail, i will move onto the next suggestions on this thread.* \n\n*Thank you again everyone!*",

There are a few brands that make them,  and I've definitely found the solid ones way better than other formats.\n\nOnly time they struggle is when I have that stress sweat thing going (this is a thing,  right?), and I think the only thing that would help would be antiperspirant in those times.",

Does your house have any smell at all when you first go in the door. Musty mildew moldy earthy? That is critical to healing.\n\nCritical step 2: How long have you been sick? If you have been sick for years, biofilms can build complicating things.\n\nCritical Step 3: Are you under or overmethylated.\n\nHives, Red skin, Itchiness, Lots of tears, saliva, and feeling understimulated is Undermethyalation. Methylated vitamins Like low dose methylated nutrients found in Seeking health Multivitamin One (low dose) are best for you.\n\nQuercetin, Turmeric, Ginger can be helpful for undermethylators.  Be aware! They can give some with slow MAO gene too much seretonin,  resulting in vivid colors, laughing too much, and dry eyes. See how you tolerate them, I do not.\n\nOvermethylators are the opposite,  \nNot getting red when scratching the skin, Dry eyes or mouth, Insomnia, not able to calm down, even Vivid colors! Seeking Health Multivitamin MF (methyl Free) can help a lot. Niacinamide 500 Mg up to 2000 mg a day (2x500mg twice a day) can really help remove the anxiety, insomnia and relieve dry eyes. Glycine which is inside collagen and gelatin can help with overmethylation by Methionine.\n\n  \nB complexes are not advised! Multivitamin One by Seeking health has all the extra A D E K and Minerals with the B vitamins IN THE PROPER DOSE! B Complex is like putting gas and oil in your car, but forgetting to put in transmission fluid and brake fluid. We need All the vitamins and mineral together In a good multivitamin, not a single high dose of these nutrients is needed.\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\* YOU MAY HAVE TO START ON DIGESTION, THEN HERBAL ANTIBIOTICS THEN AFTER INFECTION AND HISTAMINE IS LOWERED , THEN START NURITION.  STRESS SUPPORT CAN BE STARTED RIGHT AWAY\\*\\*\\*\n\nYOU CAN TAKE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL  OR BENTONITE CLAY ONE HOUR AFTER HERBALS TO ABSORB TOXINS \\*\\*\\*BEFORE\\*\\*\\* THEY ENTER BLOOD STREAM  \nLong term use can cause bile deficiency. \n\nYou can add one supplement at a time and check response!  You can take a day or two break and have just meat a potatoes for a day or so, or even soup, and get your baseline. If you feel better, Some supplements may be reacting and it's not just \"die off\".\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Nutrition.  \nThe body needs key nutrients to function. Without them, it cannot function correctly. For Example, Vitamin C deficiency can have bleeding gums, hemorrhoids (collagen needs vitamin c) and scurvy. Vitamin B1 deficiency can cause Panic and Anxiety attacks, insomnia, extreme stress, and others.\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Vitamins and Minerals  \nVitamin A, B1,2,3,5,6,9,12, Biotin Pantothenic acid, Vitamin C, D ,E K1 K2,  \nMinerals  \nWithout magnesium, the body loses ability to make GABA and relax the mind, also causing muscle tension, spasms, twitching, pain, and cramps. Potassium is KEY as well. 2000Mg a day MINUMUM.  \nZinc, Copper, Iodine, Selenium, Magnesium, Manganese, Calcium, Potassium, Boron, Molybdenum,  \nChromium, Trace minerals as well.  \nWe need all of the amino acids from glycine to methione, and all the essential fatty acids like omega 3 in fish oil/salmon.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Digestion  \nThe body needs the correct PH of stomach acid. If the PH is too high, Food does not digest correctly and vitamins/minerals like zinc, cannot be absorbed.  \nHCL Acid as betain HCL  \nPepsin  \nEnzymes for fat carb and protein digestion\n\nBile acids  \nSome enzymes are fungal produced and are not good for mold patients, It is best to use porcine/bovine enzymes as a trial. Now foods pancrease 2000 or Standard process zypan works good for me.  Enzymedica seems to bad for me.\n\nIf the gallbladder is sluggish and has sludge stones, the body cannot RID ITSELF OF FAT SOLUABLE TOXINS. Bile MUST be flowing, Especially for MOLD.\n\nOx Bile / Tudca can help give the body bile to dissolve cholesterol stones blocking the LIVER AND Bile ducts. The LIVER makes BILE. It is only stored in the gallbladder and concentrated. People have had their gallbladder removed only to get a gallstone inside their liver, causing relapse of pain.\n\nThe body needs Taurine, Glycine, and Choline to make bile acids. Deficiencies in these can affect someone greatly.  \nGallbladder flushes can help tremendously. The flushed I have done have changed my life.\n\nAfter overeating, eating food you don't tolerate or taking lots of antimicrobial or just general constipation, A Vitamin C flush can work miracles. I prefer Potent C Guard by Perque or for less cost, I use C Salts major brand in 3 flavors or Unflavored. 2 Teaspoon every 15 minutes in 4-6 ounces of water until you use the restroom.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Herbal Antimicrobials/Infections\n\nMany patients have multiple infections. Mold, Lyme, Candida, Sibo, with many different strains and types of pathogens.  \nI prefer and overcame with FC Cidal, Dysbiocide, and Silverbiotics patented Colloidal Silver.\n\nNow foods candida support, MCT oil, Monolaurin, and Biocidin can help. Biocidin can be bad for people with overmethylation and slow MAO due to the drying eyes and excess serotonin. See how you tolerate it.  \nNutridyn Nutricidin is very potent broad actions essential oil capsules. I started them before I did all these other areas of this 5 pillar protocol. I feel I do not need it anymore. It hit the infection hard, maybe to hard at the beginning. Everything needs to be working good in the body , to truly heal and detox. That is why this protocol was created.\n\nActivated charcoal can help soak up bacterial LPS (toxins) and some mold.  \nBentonite clay seems to be much better at absorbing mycotoxins from mold and helped me must better than activated charcoal after using it for 6 months.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Stress and Genetics support.\n\nThe body goes into flight or fight after long term infections, nutrient depletion, and the emotional stress building from being sick so long. Obsessions, insomnia, wired but tired, Not able to relax mentally, and being exhaused are all criticld RED FLAG warning signs.\n\nTo heal the body MUST be able to into the rest and digest parasympathetic system. The fight or flight adrenal respons causes the immune, digestion, hormonal and repoductive systems to turn off. The body is in survival mode, It does not care about these sytems when chased by a lion.

Then you can crash right into a tree. Why? You missed brake fluid.\n\nYes I know it is complicated and frustrating.

        "body": "I took methyl B vitamins just once and it gave me extreme insomnia and a severely slow gut. I took one serving of a methyl b complex without b6. I'm suffering 2 months of extreme insomnia.\n\nI'm not the only one. I've had so many redditors message me and say the same.\n\nThere's even people on YouTube comments from years ago saying they're suffering the same after taking a methyl b complex.\n\nThese vitamins aren't a joke and can do serious damage if taken by the wrong person.\n\nI'm hopeless and not sure what to do anymore.\n\nI'm SIBO methane positive but I've never ever had slow motility (I go once every 4-5 days) and the insomnia and severely slow gut motiltiy started on the same night.\n\nPolite and important note - Don't mind me saying - you're recommending supplements (every supplement under the sun it seems) - these are not harmless if taken by someone who doesn't need them. So many cofactors are needed for B1 for example like B2 (B1 depletes B2 and magnesium is needed for B1 absorption etc) - one thing can cause a deficiency in another... Genuinely great that it worked out for you and it's no hate on your success - I just wanted people to know not to go around messing with vitamins thinking they're harmless and won't cause additional problems or side effects - vitamins are JUST AS POTENT and side effect potentials are JUST AS POSSIBLE as with pharma meds. Methylation cycles are not something minor to mess with. It caused me severe insomnia (read my post history - I'm still dealing with it).\n\nMy post is not to shi* on your success or advice but to warn people if they take these vitamins, that they're not guaranteed a risk free outcome. In other words... Follow at your own risk.\n\nEDIT: I have severe insomnia and slow gut motility ever since taking a methyl b complex without b6 (no b6 please by tiny pioneer brand) - I scratch my skin and it goes red immediately. So am I overmethylating or undermethylating? If you google the symptoms.. Both overlap.\n\nApparently the best way to find out if you're overmethylating or undermethylating is a whole blood histamine test.\n\nAnyway my comment is not to criticise OPs success. But pls.. Learn from my story and be careful (have a look at my post history).\n\nAnd I tried the niacin and glycine thing..made me worse.",

        "body": "Dr. Hulda Clark Gallbladder Flush Protocol:\n\nNOTE: Do not attempt to flush an inflamed Gallbladder. SUPPLIES: ÔÉ± Fresh, Unopened Pint of Organic Olive Oil (you will use ¬Ω cup (120 ml) for the flush) ÔÉ± Several lemons or grapefruits for fresh-squeezed juice ÔÉ± Epsom Salts 4 tablespoons (60 gr) ÔÉ± (2) Clean Pint Glass Jars w/ Lids\n\nTHE TREATMENT: Eat a no-fat breakfast and lunch such as cooked cereal, fruit, fruit juice, bread and preserves or sweetening (no butter or milk). This allows the bile to build up and develop pressure in the liver. Higher pressure pushes out more stones. Limit the amount you eat to the minimum you can get by on. You will get more stones. The earlier you stop eating the better your results will be, too. In fact, stopping fat and protein the night before gets even better results. Finish eating by 12 noon with only sips later.\n\n2:00 P.M. Do not eat or drink after 2 o'clock. If you break this rule you could feel quite ill later. Get your Epsom salts ready. Mix 4 Tbsp (60 gr). in three cups water (720 ml) and pour this into a safe jar. This makes four servings, ¬æ cup (180 ml) each. Set the jar in the refrigerator to get ice cold (this is for convenience and taste only).\n\n6:00 PM. Drink one serving (¬æ cup ‚Äì 180 ml) of the ice-cold Epsom salts. If you did not prepare this ahead of time, mix 1 Tbsp. in ¬æ cup (180 ml) water now. You may rinse your mouth, but spit out the water. 8:00 P.M. Repeat by drinking another ¬æ cup (180 ml) of Epsom salts. You haven't eaten since two o'clock, but you won't feel hungry. Get your bedtime chores done. The timing is critical for success.\n\n9:45 P.M. Pour ¬Ω cup (120 ml) olive oil into the pint jar. Squeeze the grapefruit by hand into the measuring cup. Remove pulp with fork. You should have at least ¬Ω cup (120 ml) . You may use lemonade to make a full ¬Ω cup. Add this to the olive oil. Close the jar tightly and shake hard until watery (only fresh citrus juice does this). 9:50 P.M. Drink the potion you have mixed. Drinking through a large plastic straw helps it go down easier. Take it to your bedside if you wish. Get it down within five minutes (15 minutes for very elderly or weak persons)\n\n. Lie down immediately. You might fail to get stones out if you don't. The sooner you lie down the more stones you will get out. Be ready for bed ahead of time. Don't clean up the kitchen. As soon as the drink is down walk to your bed and lie on your right side with your right knee pulled up close to your chest for 30 minutes. Go to sleep. Call your health care professional if you have severe nausea or pain under right rib cage.\n\nTry to think about what is happening in the liver. Try to keep perfectly still for at least 20 minutes.

You may add another ¬Ω tsp. citric acid to it (or capsules) and get even more stones. Half an hour later eat fruit. One hour later you may eat regular food but keep it light.

You don't need to spend $$$ and get a Mason Pearson brush, any type of boar bristle or mix is fine. \"scritch and preen\" is another method, you can google/youtube it. This is preferably done at night, and if you can, get a satin/silk pillow to sleep on.\n\nFor us ladies with fine hair the transition is much longer, but be patient! I was so frustrated at the 3month mark since everything I've read here on reddit or online mentioned that was the typical benchmark where your scalp normalized sebum production. The more you wash/shampoo your hair, the less your natural oils can properly do their work. i'm on day 3 and my hair has so much volume (never in my life could i achieve this pre no-poo) and doesn't look greasy at the roots at all.

        "body": "Most people covered the basics (transition can take months, stick to one or two methods, stay calm, try lo-poo if needed). However, there are a few more things to keep in mind.\n\n1. With almost any no-poo or lo-poo method you will need to manually loosen and remove all of the sebum and dead skin from your hair and scalp. Learn to scritch and preen, and invest in a decent boar bristle or sisal brush. Also learn how to properly brush your hair in small sections from root to tip using said brush. This will all help to redistribute and remove your natural oils. In the shower, scrub your scalp with your fingertips even if you're not using any product and then manually preen sections of your hair from root to tip to help wring out the oils.\n\n2. If you have hard water (most people in the US do), certain methods may NOT work for you. (You can tell if you have particularly hard water if there's a lot of mineral buildup in your shower or washing machine.) Hard water unfriendly methods includes WO and the use of certain products that can leave a film in your hair. Acidic rinses like diluted vinegar or lemon juice can help, but not all hair types enjoy them. You can try rinsing with bottled water (though this can get pricey) or installing a water softener in your shower.\n\n3. If your are a naturally oily person, WO and other methods meant for drier skin may NEVER work for you. Everyone is unique and we all produce differing levels of natural oil. If you're more oily than most don't fight it; instead seek out methods designed for oily scalps (clay masks, egg washing, certain shampoo bars combined with vinegar rinses). \n\n4. Your hair will always feel more \"waxy\" or oily with no-poo than with shampoo, even after the transition period. This is because you're not stripping the natural sebum and are instead coating your hair with it. This may sound gross, but it's far more protective than any hair mask. If you absolutely cannot deal with having slightly oily hair at all times, seek out lo-poo methods (sulfate free shampoos, shampoo bars, etc.) that will give you a squeaky clean feeling.",

Below you will find my **very** in depth routine, reviews, products I want, and more. I have been up and down trying to control my skin and I'm finally at the point where I'm happy enough with it. I still have imperfections, but if I could only have this skin the rest of my life, I would be more than okay with that. I don't have a good before (cause hey, when you have acne like I did you AVOID pictures.) I had the large pustules with multiple heads in one area, deep cystic acne, and so much PIH. THIRTEEN years is what is has taken to get the skin I have today. A lot of money has gone into my skin. I have wanted to give up SO many times. I am here to say, I see those of you who feel hopeless. This post is less about celebrating my clear skin and more about to illustrate how HARD one needs to work to get it. For some people, less is more. For others, more is necessary. What's important is listening to your skin and giving it what it's asking for. This is what I'm currently doing for my skin. As I notice negative changes, I adapt. I try new products constantly. I empty a bottle and pick up something else. Because this might work now, but the next one may work better. To help me keep track of the products I'm using and when to use them, I use SkinSmart. It allows me to see my skin history over time and how products/environment/life events affect it.\n\n\nSkin type: normal/dry\n\n\nSkin history: super fair skinned and never cared about sunscreen until I was mid twenties. I grew up on a working ranch and like to kayak/etc. So yeah, sun damage. Mostly in the form of freckles and tight feeling skin if I'm not moisturizing. Living in North Texas (sun and pollution are issues.) Work in front of a computer all day. Glasses/contacts. I suffer from seasonal allergies and usually when my allergies flare up I get acne due to the extra face contact and I get milia on my cheeks. I am on an oral contraceptive (combination hormone) and usually skip my periods. I don't struggle with acne anymore, but occasionally get something cystic on my chin that is large, painful, and deep or blackheads on my lip I pissed off that flared up. I do struggle with closed comedones on my forehead and have always chocked it up to poor skin texture until I saw my doctor. Now I say anymore because back in the day, ya girl needed some help. Neither Accutane or Differin made a difference then. I've been on a thirteen year journey and have finally found pretty clear skin. I luckily avoided scarring (by not picking/popping/aggravating any of it.) So I only had to deal with uneven skin texture and hyperpigmentation. Until last year, I was on tret 0.1% to help treat everything and this was the real game changer I think. I've had a handful of peels done at my derm, resurfacing treatments, and some other random stuff. It has not been easy and don't be too hard on yourself. Remember, YMMV!!\n\n\nSkin concerns: dull skin, CC's, PIH, large pores, flushed appearance, mild scarring, allergy induced milia, aging, and KP.\n\n\nNon-routine skin choices/behaviors:\n\n* Drinking at least 48oz of water a day\n* Pillow cases/face towels changed every two days\n* Makeup is always removed by a wipe prior to cleansing (I have various wipes, lol)\n* I don't pick at my skin, will use (sterilized) tools when extracting\n* Conscious of face touching\n* Makeup brushes/blenders are washed weekly\n* Admittedly, I have a terrible sleep schedule. Usually up after midnight and at work by 9am.\n* I am pre diabetic so I already limit carbs/sugars and it's improved my skin a lot!\n* Face towels changed every other day\n* I use a lot of different lip balms, some of my favorites are Vaseline Lip Therapy, Burt's Bees, and Eos.\n* Taking a probiotic specifically to help with skin health\n* Using Amlactin Daily on my KP spots and exfoliating in the shower, huge improvement!\n\nI recently saw my derm and got a script for BP + Clindamycin and 0.05% tretinoin. The routine below is what I've been following BEFORE getting on these. I followed with my new routine as well.\n\n\nDaily AM:\n\n* Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-one (blue, no rinse, applied w/ a cotton ball)\n* Clean & Clear Essentials Deep Cleaning Toner (0.5% salicylic acid, applied w/ hands)\n* Olay Mist Ultimate Hydration Essence Energizing (Vit C and Bergamot)\n* Yes to Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer (Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri/Sat)\n* Sunday Riley C.E.O.

No serums, no other actives. Just gentle products. I've used a lot of these before and really like them! I'll carry my rose water spray and Johnson's Baby Lotion with me to use during the day to keep my skin hydrated. I will also probably exclusively use my Vaseline Lip Care these first few weeks and up my water intake even more.\n\n\nAdditional products I have that I may or may not have tried yet. Most I obtained either as samples with a purchase or in a subscription box (I get a skin care focused Ipsy Plus and Facetory Lux Plus.) I'll include reasons why I am excited to try them, hesitations, my initial thoughts, and where I would plant them in my existing routine:\n\n[Generation Clay Purifying Pink Clay Mask](https://generationclay.com/shop/purifying-pink-clay-mask/) ($29 USD) - So this has a slight rose scent and I'm a sucker for floral scents in my skincare. It is a kaolin/bentonite clay blend. Clay masks are supposed to be good for oil control and helping to shrink pores (if your large pores are because of excess sebum production.) I will use this on Mondays and remove either with a wet konjac or the low setting on my spinbrush/using a manual brush to help loosen up the dried clay. It has an aggressive minty sensation when you apply it. It subsides pretty quickly so don't be alarmed! This mask dried me out a bit but not so much that it was uncomfortable. I had a noticeable reduction in pore size after one mask.\n\n**Aperire Spa Relief Be Frozen Pore Mask** - The package, with the exception of the name, is entirely in Korean. Luckily, Facetory sent me a handy guide so I can talk about it. This mask has menthol in it. I thought the pink clay was aggressively minty? Prepare thyself! Just like with any clay mask, don't panic when you try to take it off! I like to use a wet konjac or a brush to help work the clay off. I would use this on Mondays. I tried hard for where to find this in the US, no luck. I got it in my Facetory Lux Plus Summer 2019. If anyone has a link, please share!\n\n[Hey Honey Sweet Treat Wild Berry & Honey Yogurt Recovery Mask](https://www.heyhoney.com/wild-berry-honey-yogurt-recovery-mask-sweet-treat/) ($48 USD) - So this is a gel type mask and I plan to incorporate it right where \"paper/gel masks\" fall. Though it's a \"recovery\" mask, I will likely save it for when I've been ultra stressed, sleep deprived, or partied too hard.\n\n[Soroci Lycomato Super Restorative Sleeping Mask](https://www.facetory.com/products/soroci-lycomato-super-restorative-sleeping-mask) ($16 USD) - I will switch to this when I've used up my FAB sleeping mask and then make a decision on which to purchase full size. I got both as samples so I want to compare and see which works better for me. I love this brand so I am excited to try a sleeping mask from them.\n\n[Garnier SkinActive Glow Boost Illuminating Moisturizer](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garnier-SkinActive-Glow-Boost-Illuminating-Moisturizer-2-fl-oz/124296677) - Came as a sample with my micellar water. I like the scent and the brand has always been good to my skin. Still haven‚Äôt tried it yet but once my skin is adjusted to the tret I will likely use this as an AM moisturizer.\n\n[Commleaf Rose Blooming Mist](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/commleaf-rose-blooming-mist-70ml/1539227372/) ($25.30 USD) - I use this whenever my skin needs moisture during the day, has a lot of irritation, or just looks blah. I definitely like it better than the Mario Bandeau rose mist. I have used it as a hydrating toner and as an essence. Definitely a HG product!\n\n[Pure Foret Centella Multi Lotion](https://www.stylekorean.com/shop/pureforet-centella-multi-lotion-150ml/1539852527/) ($25.19 USD) - The word is Centella Asiatica extract has acne healing properties. I don't suffer from the big pustules or too much cystic acne anymore. I used this recently when I had a breakout and oh no, it smells awful. My skin felt really nice after and the smell dissipated rather quickly. I won't be using it in my regular routine, but may switch to it when I have breakouts. It‚Äôs best as your final layer since it‚Äôs a thicker cream. The only thing I‚Äôd put on top would be a sunscreen or an occlusive!\n\n**Daiso Sake Milky Lotion** - This was an impulse buy. Cute bottle and all. I haven‚Äôt tried it out yet but this is a pretty watery moisturizer and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll like it. It was only a $1.50 so if it sucks (and it probably does) I won‚Äôt really feel guilty throwing it away.\n\n[BRTC Vitamin Powder Cleansing Tea Bag](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/brtc-v10-powder-cleansing-tea-bag-2-types-vitamin/info.html/pid.1073648197) - I‚Äôm actually super excited to try this! But also sort of nervous? The directions say you can use it a few different ways, as a cleanser, a mask, or to soak in (like bath or foot soak.) And I guess I‚Äôm worried I will do it wrong. It‚Äôs a sachet of different things (I‚Äôm not very technical, sorry) and you either let it steep like tea or use the pouch as a foaming net to cleanse. I have like 5 of them so I need to just take the plunge. \n\n\nMasks in my drawer: (I have a problem, not sorry)\n\n* The Beautiful factr. Water Shield Barrier Mask\n* XOY Calendula Mask\n* Meg. Two Step Jelly Mask Firming and Radiance\n* Nohj Intra Gold 24K Modeling Mask Pearl\n* Ischia Miracle Marine Collagen Magic Gel Siren Mask\n* BRTC Aqua Rush Pearl Mask\n* Keeome White Mulberry Hydration\n* Reason Y Jet Setter\n* Naisture Aqua 3 Step Moisturizing Mask\n* Naisture Aqua 3 Step Brightening Mask\n* The Medius Heart Ppyoung Ppyoung Eye Patch\n* ToGoSpa Coconut Lips Lip Love\n* ToGoSpa Bamboo Charcoal Eyes\n* Taste Beauty So Meowgical Hydrating Face Mask\n* Taste Beauty Just Peachy Hydrating Face Mask\n* Maskology Under Eye Gold Gel Mask\n* Maskology Colorshine Peel Off Mask\n* Riley Rose Peony Collagen Mask\n* lookATME Look At My Foot Heal Mask\n* by nature Calm + Restore 2-in-1\n* SooAE Hydration Alert Sensor Mask\n* Maskology Watermelon Moisturizing Mask\n* SooAE Cactus Soothing Gel Mask\n\n\nItems you see that are my husband's‚Ä¶\n\n* Biore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips\n* Clean & Clear Dual Action Moisturizer (0.5% salicylic acid) - guilty of using this when I‚Äôm desperate, but usually it is way too drying for me\n* Clean & Clear Night Relaxing Deep Cleansing Face Wash\n* Freeman Pore Cleansing Volcanic Ash Peel-Off Gel Mask\n* (He also uses the Clean & Clear Essentials toner. His routine is minimal if at all, lol.)\n\n\nI swear by the [Bliss Drench & Quench Cream to Water Hydrator](https://www.ulta.com/drench-quench-moisturizer?productId=xlsImpprod17921136) ($20 USD). The jar is very light so it feels cheap, but it's a great product. I've noticed if I'm heavy with it, it will cause pilling. But a light coat is all you need. I've been using it as my night mask but I'll probably be switching that up soon. Not because it's not great, but it's not giving me the moisture boost I want overnight. (I will likely finish the Yes to Tomatoes and use the Bliss in the AM.) But this product just sort of melts into your skin and that's what I really love about it. I can feel a lot of moisturizers on my skin, whether it's a sticky/tacky feel or sometimes like oil/sebum.\n\nSince adding the **jade roller** I have noticed a reduction in my pores. No other products added with it. I also feel like my face is slimmer now. I feel like that's due to it being cooling and helping depuff. I got mine at five below and am happy enough with it. Will definitely upgrade cause this one squeaks sometimes and I'm wanting a pink one, lol.\n\nThe **spin brush** I have is actually from five below. For $5 it's actually a decent brush. I complain I can't get new heads but for $5...I will say that the kit comes with an exfoliating disc (nononono don't use that on your face,) and sponge disc (what is the purpose?,) and a massager disc (which I definitely use on my home facial days.) It's cheap, it's not waterproof, but it gets the job done. I get a new one every month to keep the head fresh. I also use an [Ecotools face brush](https://www.ulta.com/facial-cleansing-brush?productId=xlsImpprod16601265) ($5.99 USD) that I really like. The bristles on both of these are really soft. I haven't noticed any microtearing as I use a pretty light hand with either tool.\n\n[First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Hydra Firm Sleeping Cream](https://m.sephora.com/product/ultra-repair-hydra-firm-sleeping-cream-P393076) ($38 USD) - Admittedly, I am not impressed with this yet. It has a strange smell I can't quite place (eucalyptus, duh) and I don't know if I don't like it yet. Thirty minutes later and it still has a feel on my face. I know sleeping masks are supposed to be heavy, but this is different. In the morning my skin was almost still tacky, but very hydrated and supple! Likely won't purchase the full size unless there is a killer sale on it. - I wrote this before I started using it two or three times a week. I've noticed a big improvement in my skin since using it! I actually really like the product and found it worked best if I put some kind of humectant under it. (I usually use my rose water spray.) May be a new holy grail. I am still going to try out the Soroci mask and see which I like better before buying full size.\n\n[Yes to Tomatoes Daily Balancing Moisturizer](https://www.target.com/p/yes-to-tomatoes-daily-balancing-moisturizer-1-7-fl-oz/-/A-11269650) ($8.69 USD) - This is my current AM moisturizer, but I will not be repurchasing. It is too light and when using acids it doesn‚Äôt provide enough moisture and my skin gets flaky. Now that I‚Äôm switching to tret, I may need to just push it aside and not use it. If you have oily skin it is awesome because it‚Äôs not too heavy. But for those of us on the dry side (whether dry type or normal with acids/etc) we shouldn‚Äôt put any stock in it.\n\n[Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF 50 + / PA +++](https://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Sunprise-Finish-SPF50/dp/B00WE3XGAC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=etude+house+sun+milk&qid=1562453391&s=gateway&sr=8-1) ($10 USD) - I love this product. You‚Äôll have to pry it from my cold dead hands. It‚Äôs cheap, works well, and is perfect for my ‚Äústays inside/works in an office now‚Äù life. If I was going hiking/spending all day in the sun, I‚Äôd still wear it and just add a hat. I wish it was ++++, but beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. No whitecast (but also I am so pale it‚Äôs dumb) and just melts into your skin. I used to see people say some sunscreens turn to powder after application and I was like, say what? Now I see! And it is amazing. My makeup sits over it nicely, though I only use concealer where needed and powder. I can‚Äôt attest to how a full coverage foundation would sit on it.\n\nSo I actually really like the [Bliss Fab Foaming 2-in-1 Cleanser and Exfoliator with Bamboo Buffers](https://www.target.com/p/bliss-fab-foaming-oil-free-gel-cleanser-6-4-fl-oz/-/A-53085418) ($9.99 USD) for a basic routine. It has a very mild exfoliant so it doesn't NEED a brush or other type of tool. It's not overly drying, my skin feels clean but not...sticky (stripped) after cleansing with it. Before starting an advanced routine it was definitely my go to. I am considering switching to a cleanser without any exfoliant (so I don't need two for the days I use a chemical exfoliant, and the answer to this was the **CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**) and possibly something I can use in the whipping device I got. I love the way foam feels on my skin (and this doesn't foam into a whip like I wish it would.) Though it will always remain a favorite and definitely on the HG list.\n\nYou'll notice I have a few **peel off masks**. I bought these before I knew they're sort of useless. They are fun for get togethers and if my husband wants to participate. However, they don't serve much of a purpose unless you just don't exfoliate. If you want real benefits, use paper, clay, or mud masks.\n\n[Sunday Riley C.E.O. Vitamin C Rich Hydration Cream](https://m.sephora.com/product/c-e-o-c-e-antioxidant-protect-repair-moisturizer-P416139) ($65 USD) - This moisturizer is kind of sticky. It has a light citrus scent, to be expected of a vitamin C product. I've got to complain that I can't get the seal off easily. I am guilty of leaving these on my masks and less used moisturizers to help save the shelf life. The one on this one creates a seal and it hard to get off. It comes in a heavy glass jar, which tbh scares the hell out of me since I am a klutz. Just due to the price, I doubt I will keep buying it. I got it in my Ipsy Plus box June 2019. I would rather use a vitamin C serum that is not the last thing on my skin. The feel of it went away when I applied my (mattifying) sunscreen.\n\n**Curology 4% Niacinamide, 1% Clindamycin, 4% Azelaic Acid** My flagship formula. I was hoping they would put me back on tret, but this is what I got. It's helping with my flushed appearance some and gotten rid of my CCs on my forehead. It does absolutely nothing for my allergy induced milia. Now that my derm has prescribed me the BP + Clindamycin I will probably get TO Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% and the TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% and just cancel my Curology. My provider is against putting me on tret so I had my derm write me a script for it. I have little reason to stick with Curology now.\n\nSpeaking of Curology, **The Cleanser** and **The Moisturizer**. I fell IN LOVE after the first use. But the price? Nah. Also, I am likely not keeping my subscription so I needed to find some dupes. So The Cleanser is super creamy and non-stripping, if anything my skin feels a lot more hydrated after I cleanse with this. I‚Äôd heard some murmers about possible dupes and purchased the [CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser](https://www.target.com/p/cerave-hydrating-facial-cleanser-for-normal-to-dry-skin-fragrance-free-12oz/-/A-13977968) ($11.99 USD) and oh my god, this is such an amazing face wash. I think I like it more than the Curology one! The moisturizer was a little harder. So I did some digging and purchased [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream for Extra Dry Skin](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-neutrogena-hydro-boost-hyaluronic-acid-gel-face-moisturizer-to-hydrate-and-smooth-extra-dry-skin-1-7oz/-/A-16600134) ($16.99 USD) and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll look back. It doesn‚Äôt leave a feel on your skin like the Curology one does but my skin feels just as hydrated after using it. I used it before when it came out and never purchased again because if I‚Äôm being honest, I thought too much moisturizer was my problem with my acne.\n\nI need to be a little honest, the [Olay Mist Ultimate Hydration Essence Energizing](https://www.target.com/p/olay-mist-ultimate-hydration-essence-energizing-with-vitamin-c-and-bergamot-facial-moisturizer-3-3-fl-oz/-/A-75563795) ($9.99 USD) and [Olay Mist Ultimate Hydration Essence Calming](https://www.target.com/p/olay-mist-ultimate-hydration-essence-calming-with-aloe-leaf-and-chamomile-facial-moisturizer-3-3-fl-oz/-/A-75563802) ($9.99 USD) are really just water-y feeling. I know it‚Äôs a water-type product, but those of you who have used good facial mists know what I mean by this. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but it just lacks the feeling of benefit. I don‚Äôt notice a difference other than the momentary boost in hydration. I will not be purchasing these again, though I do like the scents they come in and the bottles look nice. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a very beneficial product when the **Commleaf Rose Blooming Mist** is such a game changer for me.\n\n*Just a note: I know this sub discourages derma rolling, I am working along with my derm for this. I do not advise anyone do derma rolling without the supervision of their derm or just having the derm do it for you. I purchased a high end product (that I will not be linking) at the advice of my derm. So no, I won't tell you how to do it, where to get it, etc. I will say that if you struggle with things such as: circulation, skin texture, acne scarring, and tight skin, talk to your derm about if adding it is right for you.*\n\nSkin Wish List: Products I'm DYING to try, why and where I plan to use them.\n\n* [Nurture by Nature Beauty Sleep CBD Infused Hydration Mask](https://www.nxnbeauty.com/catalog/?productid=1372)\nI have heard a ton of amazing things about CBD in beauty [source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/natural-skincare/cbd-oil-benefits-for-skin-can-help-acne-anti-aging.html) and have been wanting to add it into my routine. What better way that as the final step? I don't generally use sleeping masks/packs or occlusives in the summer due to my increased water intake. But they're basically a nightly thing during the colder months. So I'll wait to buy a bottle until it gets cold here (I'm in Texas so it'll be November, lol.) It's only $19 and I've seen some well received reviews on this company's products.\n* [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-caffeine-solution-5pct-egcg-30ml) \nCaffeine is great for puffiness and dark circles. While I can't drink caffeine due to it making my jittery, I hope that applying it to my face will have benefits. I would replace my eye cream with this. I would give my eyes extra moisture by tapping my moisturizer on.\n* [Glossier The Balm Dotcom](https://www.glossier.com/products/balm-dotcom?utm_source=FBIG_US_Broad_Women_18_65&utm_medium=paidsocial&utm_campaign=US_Broad_LAL_ACQ&utm_content=Marcela_BDC&g_ref=fe96da46dc4a93) \nI have heard so much about their products. I'm a little hesitant to buy a $12 lip balm but the page claims you can use it on your face too as an occlusive. Has anyone done this before?\n* A skincare fridge!\nI've had my eye on this [one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NGMTKQ3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_jkebDbB8PMH0W) for some time now, mostly because it's cute and the right size. My bathroom is on the opposite end of my house from the kitchen. I also share that fridge! Many products keep better in the fridge (such as vitamin C, organic compounds, etc) and many others are just more refreshing when cold! This is sort of my end goal in skincare to preserve the products I'm not using daily such as serums and masks. Seeing as how most mini fridges like this run at this price, it'll probably be a gift to myself after a few more months of solid routine consistency.\n\n\nWhere I source my products:\n\n* [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/)\n* [Target](https://www.target.com/)\n* [French Pharmacy](https://frenchpharmacy.com/)\n* [Soko Glam](https://sokoglam.com/)\n* [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/women.html)\n* [Facetory Luxe Plus](https://www.facetory.com/)\n* [Ipsy Glam Bag Plus](https://www.ipsy.com/)\n* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/)\n\n\nIf you made it this far, congrats, you're probably also obsessed with skincare or absolutely fed up with your acne. Thanks for taking the time to read and feel free to ask questions! I'll try to link a picture of my current (before this round of tret) skin for y'all to see! I suck at reddit formatting so I'll probably have to edit this as soon as I post it. Also, ask about anything, seriously. I want y‚Äôall to have good skin too!",

        "body": "Glossier BDC is straight up Vaseline with really yummy fragrances added to it all in a cute tube. \n\nI love my little skin fridge. I keep all L-AA products in there as well as my eye creams. It doesn‚Äôt fit much else but I did manage to jam 2 full size sleeping pack jars and I always keep a couple of samples of REN Calming Masks in there. That product in particular feels amazing when they are chilled. The rest of my sheet masks and rinse-off masks are in my regular fridge.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt exchange your eye cream for the TO caffeine unless you have zero issues with hydration and/or don‚Äôt apply Tret anywhere near your eyes. It‚Äôs meant to constrict the blood vessels (which honestly after 4 bottles, I gave up on it as I saw FAR more of a difference using Sulwhasoo Ginseng Eye Cream and zero results from TO‚Äôs caffeine) and really doesn‚Äôt offer much in terms of hydrating that delicate area.\n\nEdit: There‚Äôs no way I would put BDC on my face because of the added fragrances. If those don‚Äôt bother you, then it would be the same as using Vaseline. When my skin was dehydrated, I used to use equal parts Dr. Jart Cicapair Cream + Cerave Healing Ointment and it worked so quickly.  As much as I can‚Äôt stand Cerave, the blue tube actually worked well as an occlusive. Someone in the sub had recommended it years ago and it was my HG for quite a while. Stratia Ultra Gold also helped (and still helps) with extra hydration. It scares me to think of it not being available - I‚Äôve never found any other light moisturizer that even comes close to the efficacy or slip.\n\nEdit 2: I have birthday cake, rose, coconut, and mango in the BDC so I don‚Äôt hate it. I went through a Glossier phase and had to have ‚Äúall the things‚Äù and they all just kind of take up space now as I have other balms and masks I reach for first. They do taste pretty damn good.",

        "body": "Great post! Your skin looks beautiful! You more than deserve it! I use a lot of bliss products too! During prime day on amazon I saw it was half off (I think) so I purchased the What a melon toner, pore patrol cleanser, pore patrol warming scrub, jelly ball cleanser, and lemon and sage body wash. I very rarely like everything from one brand but I want to try everything they have. Especially the overnight green tea mask with azelaic acid and the mint chip one. https://www.blissworld.com/masks/\n\nI received the Sunday Riley ceo cream too, I actually feel like it leaves a powdery velvet texture. I don't like that it's scented but it hasn't bothered my skin so far. I don't use it as much as I want to. I need to write down a routine because I end up using one active and forgot that I wanted to use something else that night.\n\nI rarely see anyone mention the other category of skincare and I think its awesome that you included it and made such a great detailed post. I use a fresh washcloth to pat my face down after I wash it. I change/wash my pillowcases every couple days and my sheets and pillows I don't put my face on, I wash weekly. I originally bought a satin pillowcase and then came across an article about the material you should be sleeping on and you want something that is absorbent. So I purchased a silk pillowcase and its definitely my favorite pillowcase, and I use organic cotton pillowcases as well. \n\nI use organic free and clear laundry detergent and wool dryer balls because fabric softeners are da debil, and don't belong anywhere near our skin especially our face. I wash my washcloths and pillowcases together and use unscented wool dryer balls, and the rest of my clothes I will use dryer balls with essential oil like lavender or ylang ylang.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home. Please be careful with your skin and your health!**\n\n*If you see that I am replying to something out of context (eg. listed in a routine), please report this comment so my handlers can remove it.

It apparently takes quite a few days, up to a week, before it becomes fully water permeable so I am still losing about 4,000 gallons a day at this point. Only time will tell if the pond works or not.

Anthony still has a mortgage and yet owns a BMW.\n* Ken Coleman - A guy with no hiring experience, no business degree, and a work history that is almost entirely on political campaigns. **Role:** Teaching people how to make better career moves. (I guess stumbling into a Ramsey co-host position is a good career move, but I don't think that makes him an expert in the field lol)\n* Rachel Cruz - Someone who grew up in a wealthy home and was offered job opportunities at her father's extremely successful business. **Role:** Teach people struggling with money how to budget better.\n* Christy Wright - Employee who has never run any business. **Role:** Teach women about how to start and run a business.\n* Dr. John Deloney - The only qualified person to be in his position, besides Dave. Kind of a dry personality and too much of a \"yes man\" mentality with Dave, but at least he makes sense in his role.\n\n* And finally, \"Dr.\" Joshua Axe, chiropractic quack who hasn't even had a [valid chriporactic license since 2013](https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/may/q-ideas-lyons-joshua-axe-immunity-coronavirus.html).

For all of the ailments Dr. Axe would diagnose the general public with, [he convienently offers dozens of pricey supplements and essential oils to help](https://store.draxe.com/collections/popular-products)!\n\nThere's no way this company is gonna survive when Dave eventually has to retire.",

I had to beg my GI to help me figure out the cause of my digestive issues as the colonoscopy didn't reveal anything and he actually suggested I just take imodium to alleviate the horrible stomach cramps and intense attacks of diarrhea?!  When he suggested I could try a breath test he sent me to another doctor because he didn't do the breath test at his office but this other doctor did. \nAfter the results came back as sibo this doctor wrote me a script for antibiotics that I would take 3x a day for 30 days. That same year I experienced my mom almost dying from C-diff that was induced after a course of intravenous antibiotics.  I was very hesitant to start the antibiotics and was attempting to control my symptoms with diet when someone suggested I try a course of bentonite clay that can be purchased from a health food store. I bought a $20 bottle of Sonni's #7 detoxificant which is clay in a liquid solution that you mix with a glass of water and drink every day for 1 to 2 weeks. I only did it at night before bed on a mostly empty stomach for 1 week and it literally changed my life. I could eat pretty much anything and even wash it down with wine and no digestive issues!? It lasted over a year and I started having sibo symptoms again so I did another course of the Sonni's #7 and once again,  no more bloating gas painful cramps explosive diarrhea etc. \nI realize that this may not be a cure all for everyone who has this issue. It did wonders for me and my hope is that someone else will have the same experience. I know how debilitating this issue is and how mysterious the cure seems to be. If you've tried everything else I dont think there is anything to lose by giving this a try.\nOn a final note, when I informed my original GI doctor that I alleviated my symptoms with bentonite clay he barely acknowledged what I just told him!? Needless to say, I dont use him anymore.",

I scrubbed my armpits raw but it still didn't feel like normal skin. For some reason I decided to see if I could squeeze it out and I was horrified. Old deodorant was coming out of my armpits like white heads. Except it was deodorant. Same texture and similar smell to a ripe gym shirt. I couldn't get it all out. I even did a bentonite clay mask but the shit just kept coming. The worst part is I hadn't even worn deodorant for a few days due to skin irritation so only god knows how long this has been accumulating in my skin and how long it will take to come out. \n\nI never want to wear normal deodorant again. I used coconut oil this morning but when I sniff my pits closely I can still smell B.O. I have been keeping my arms clamped all day. Do I just have to accept the fact that humans are intrinsically stinky or is there something that won't accumulate under my skin that is effective? Thank you.",

The first batch I didn‚Äôt do any of those, and kind of just threw everything together. \n\nHere is the recipe I followed:\n‚Ä¢ 3lbs Kirkland Honey\n‚Ä¢ 1 Gallon of Spring Water\n‚Ä¢ 1/4 Teaspoon Yeast Nutrient \n‚Ä¢ SafAle BE-256 Yeast\n\nThe Yeast I typically use is a wine yeast, but I prefer sweeter meads. So I tried out this ale yeast, giving me a gravity reading of 1.050, and ending off at 1.010. No need to back sweeten, as the yeast did not consume all of the sugars. After it was done fermenting, I let it age for a month, before adding Bentonite Clay to clear it up the rest of the way.\n\nAbsolutely Delicious \n\n",

We were planning on casting the full thing, but did not have enough sand to fill in the 2nd half of our mold.\n\nTo make the mold, I downloaded a 3D model and cut it in half length wise, and then cut it into sections to fit onto my 3d printers bed. I then glued the pieces together and packed the sand around it.\n\nOur crucible was a (brand new) propane tank that we cut the top off. We tried using charcoal for the heat source, but then moved to propane which worked much better. The \"furnace\" we made had almost 0 insulation, we just put the crucible on some bricks from my buddy's fire pit.\n\nDuring the pour, we realized out mold wasn't level and the metal didn't get all the way to the end of the blade. We just quickly melted more aluminum and poured it into the missing area and then blasted it with a torch to weld the 2 parts together.\n\nAnyone know where I'd be able to get a ton of casting sand? I used play sand mixed with bentonite clay for my green sand, but the play sand was a bit too course. Not sure where to get finer sand either, lowes didn't have anything from what I saw.\n\nOpen to suggestions and tips for my next attempt!",

    "body": "Sooo.. Where to begin? I began getting acne around senior year of high school. Mostly forehead and chin breakouts, but didn't really do anything to take care of it. The most serious I ever got about taking care of my acne was the Clinique 3-Step system, and it completely tore and dried up my already super dry skin.\n\nMy skin progressively started getting worse over the next few years, and I began getting hormonal acne on my cheeks and jawline (places I NEVER used to get acne.) I'm talking huge deep pimples and breakouts that would never subside. I also began getting acne on my back and chest (never took pictures of these unfortunately :()\n\nhttp://imgur.com/1McgnF3\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/sq4g2bH\n\n Up until about half a year ago, I had given up on trying to cure my acne as nothing I tried was helping.\n\nThen, in May of this year, I decided to go to my GP and get on birth control (Gianvi, or generic Yaz.) The birth control immediately (within a month) cleared up my back and chest acne, but I saw no improvements in my face.\n\nIn mid June, I finally went to the dermatologist and she prescribed me Spironolactone. I can honestly say this is a miracle drug. My derm warned me that I might not see improvements for around 3 months, which was true in my case. Before those three months I was getting discouraged as I wasn't seeing any improvements and honestly wanted to give up on skin care once again. \n\nHowever, around three months on Spiro, I also discovered this subreddit... and realized I'd been doing everything wrong. I (of course) was exfoliating the crap out of my skin with the St. Ives Apricot Scrub as well as other scrubs such as the Biore unclogging. I was using Cetaphil Daily Cleanser which was drying out my skin and wasn't doing me any favors, and various moisturizers that weren't doing anything for my dry, peeling skin.\n\nAfter spending weeks on this subreddit, I decided to make some changes. I bought tons of new products and completely changed my \"routine.\"\n\nSOOOOOO, without further ado, here is my current routine:\n\nMorning:\n\n- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n- Cerave in the tub\n\nand I have 3 different nightly routines:\n\nRoutine 1:\n\n- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n- St. Ives Exfoliating Pads\n- Cerave in the tub\n\nRoutine 2:\n\n- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n- Stridex in the red box\n- Cerave in the tub\n- Layer of vaseline\n\nRoutine 3:\n\n- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser\n- Apply neem oil all over with a cotton ball\n\n\nI also use the Aztec Bentonite Clay Mask with Apple Cider Vinegar and a couple drops of honey once a week, and the Nexcare acne patches on my whiteheads (these things are incredible!! Definitely check them out!)\n\nWithin 3 months, my new routines and medicine have completely changed my skin. I have gotten compliments on my skin for the first time in my life and finally feel confident leaving the house without makeup on :)\n\nObviously, my skin is no where near perfect now. I still have so much improvement to come (hopefully)! I no longer get huge breakouts along my cheeks/jawline. I only get a couple deep pimples every now and then that whitehead quickly and go away within a couple days. My main concern at the moment is my PIH. But the texture of my skin has improved drastically and is what I'm most proud of.\n\nThank you, SCA, for showing me the light and helping me on my journey to clear skin :)\n",

Just thought I‚Äôd share the wisdom. \nMy cats enjoy a clumping cat litter, and so do I (when it comes to cleaning haha) \n\nI‚Äôve used catsan up until a few years ago, and after that like the aldi clumping litter. Aldi isn‚Äôt easy for me to get to, so sometimes i have to slum it with subpar kitty litter. \n\nToday I went to my local produce store (I live regionally), and the man recommended straight granular bentonite clay (often used for lining dams or preventing acidosis in sheep). \n\nIt was $15 for 25kg. It is the same as Catsan, possibly marginally larger but no bigger than the Aldi stuff.\nCatsan is $21 for 7kg at colesworth, though you can get it cheaper online. \n\nI looked at the bentonite suppliers website (Arumpo) and turns out they are where Catsan get their bentonite from!!! Except without the enormous markup! \n\nObviously Aldi is still a good price and good product but thought I‚Äôd share my frugal find for you anyhow!",

    "body": "A few days ago I had another relapse early morning, around 8am. Every time i relapse i get a sense of dread and despair. I often have thoughts along the lines of ‚Äúwhen will i change?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy cant I beat this/change?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat am i doing wrong‚Äù ‚Äúwhy am I so weak‚Äù . Other times I just sigh and think the same thoughts but more in a defeated tone rather than a wailing tone.\n\nVery rarely do I relapse and get filled with that fire like ‚Äúfuck. Fuck waiting i need to bounce back right tf now‚Äù. Relapsing most definitely drains you of your mental and physical energy but don‚Äôt forget you are the captain on the helm of the ship. Each choice you make is a small Victory or a surrender. These small choices add up. So you can choose your next step, don‚Äôt forget that.\n\nSo after this relapse i get filled with a sort of rage. I decide to continue crushing my day as I had planned to before the relapse. First things first i went to the gym. \n\nAndddd I couldnt even do a single dip. I was that weak physically. Mind you, i swim, wrestle in college, and have been active physically for years. This wasnt normal. But then again I had relapsed. I did some halfass reps of some other machines at the gym and hit the sauna for a bit then returned home. I noticed i was crankier , i snapped at my mom and siblings impatiently, and i drank coffee with a ton of sugar.\nUsually after a relapse i make the very bad mistake of giving in to the rest of my bad habits for the rest of the day. So i watched movies for a few hours, watched useless random rap music videos, scrolled thru reels. I was really feeling like shit and i didnt want to interact with anyone.\n\nYet that fire still lingered somewhere in me. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different outcomes. I had to make the change. I couldnt afford to wait a few days for those SR benefits to slowly start coming back.\nI HAD to rush the process- do something, anything to get me back to that winner warrior I always wanted to be. \n\nSo i decided id act on that fiery urge to do better once more. This time I first threw away the junk food in my hands and shut off the movies (that coincidentally contained triggering scenes). I went to the restroom and looked in the mirror. I looked scruffy and tired and just ROUGH.\nFuck that- i spent anywhere from 20-45 minutes doing the following- deep cleaning teeth/mouth, cleansing face, cleaning up beard, looking good smelling good etc.\nIt involved beef tallow for skin, ice for face skin, bentonite clay and hydrogen peroxide for oral health, flouride free toothpaste for teeth, taking a cold shower,  combing and shaving, and charcoal bar soap for face - not in that order.\n\nNext to get the internals right - i took bee pollen, honey with salt, some taurine and creatine. Basically i just took the healhiest stuff i could find in my kitchen.\n\nI think literally just taking some time to freshen up and look good spills over to your internal mindset and self esteem- especially after a relapse when the negative thoughts come flowing.\n\nOne thing that this little self care routine taught me is that putting even a bit of effort into at least cleaning your face and feeling fresh can go a long way.\n\nThat done, i headed over to the gym again. This time with newfound conviction and the flame still burning. I only did two exercises- pull ups and seated rows ( the ones with the chest blocker). For pull ups I spammed them. For once in a very long time i went to failure. I took it seriously, and although the sapping of my strength from the relapse earlier was still being felt, i pushed (or pulled) through the weakness. Same with the rows, i pulled with all my strength and energy until there was nothing left. Now im an avid gym goer and an athlete. But one thing I realized was how much i stay in the comfort zone even while training. I take the path of least resistance. However after this gym sesh of me genuinely pushing myself HARD i felt better than most of my training. On top of that I had relapsed earlier and now I was killing it in the gym !\n\nHit the sauna, went home n took another shower and ate a good meal of eggs n ground beef.\nI dont know about you guys but usually after a relapse the first 1-4 days are uneventful and I dont feel any SR benefits. And many of us know some of the most potent benefits come after months and months of SR. \n\nHowever this time felt like I had a cheat code. I understand a bit deeper now what ‚Äúmake the days count‚Äù means. It includes that day you relapsed as well. Even things like taking a nap (recharge), getting sun, eating super food like honey, all these help. You dont need to wait til day 5. Make each day count. This is probably the first time I relapsed and still had a successful day. Life is what you make of it and your SR journey is what you make of it as well. Dont expect the benefit of improved social skills on day 6 of SR while you have been secluded at home for day 1-5 of your streak, for example. \n(Although you still may get some improvement just by SR - thats how powerful it is - but thats a subject for another day)\n\nI guess Im saying all this to encourage you and I to  waste no time in self defeat and overthinking after a relapse and take the steps to better yourself immediately after a relapse- whether they be big or as small as refusing to be look physically drained and tired.

    "body": "My journey has been grueling, to be mild about it. I have had stomach issues for the last 4 years... got my diet right and felt good for almost a year, had an endoscopy that went wrong and all my stomach issues came back ten fold. Never considered H pylori bc my biopsy was negative. But I was also symptom-free at the time of the procedure. After the endoscopy, I continued to spiral, I could only eat 3 things for months on end, my teeth started to deteriorate bc my diet was so limited. I lost so much weight. I thought about ending it all. It was becoming too much. Nothing seemed to help. \n\nThen a light bulb went off, and I remembered from the year before, I started feeling good when I was eating a lot of fermented foods. Then I thought wow what if this IS H. pylori?? I NEVER considered it bc my endoscopy results were negative but that entire experience was terrible, it made sense to me they could have done something wrong with how badly they messed me up. They cut me really bad when they did the biopsy and it just would not heal, it kept getting worse and worse and worse. Which after a lot of suffering, I concluded this was in fact h pylori, got retested and it was positive. \n\nConsidering all my gut issues began with taking pharmaceutical antibiotics, I would NEVER go down that road again. Everything in nature serves a purpose and there are so many resources available to us to heal naturally, we just have to open our minds to them and not give doctors all of our power. I started on Pylopass which is a good bacteria that specifically treats h. pylori. I immediately started feeling better. But still sort of awful. A week later, I started taking mastic gum as well. Slowly getting better and better, thank goodness, but still not great. But I'm happy to FINALLY be in recovery. \n\nThen about 4 weeks into this protocol that has me on a slow but steady incline, I suddenly had an intuition to start eating large amounts of fermented foods. I have been on probiotic pills for years but felt like they weren't doing much. I've tried MANY different brands and they were all the same. Very underwhelming effects. Then I realized anything made in a lab is not going to be as potent as a natural source of probiotics so I bought a bunch of jars and started fermenting everything. Pickles, berries, bok choy, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, coconut milk kefir,  apples and more. I committed to having 50-70% ferments on my plate for each meal. \n\nThat was about a week ago. I am 90% back to normal. I am drinking coffee, eating chocolate, almost completely back to my normal diet which is mostly plant-based foods but haven't been able to enjoy my diet the way I like for almost a year!!! Since November 12th... when I had the endoscopy. \n\nSo whether you're looking to heal from H pylori or heal from the awful antibiotics you had to take, eat lots and lots of fermented foods for a few weeks and you WILL feel better!! Keep in mind, taking large amounts of good bacteria when you have bad bacteria present will cause die-off symptoms and just means what you are doing is WORKING. Take a binder like charcoal, zeolite or bentonite clay between meals to ease these symptoms. But don't get discouraged if you start feeling like crap, it just means this is absolutely healing your gut. The good bacteria in the ferments is what's killing off all the bad bugs in your digestive system and when this happens, the bad bugs release toxins and the body is trying to release these toxins as fast as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really hope this has helped someone feel a little hopeful about their healing. I was in the pits of despair for most of this year and it all turned around so quickly, it's so hard to believe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have been taking Pepzin GI and glutamine to help heal the stomach from the infection damage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't give up! You deserve to be happy and healthy!",

    "body": "**EDIT after reading the response: Yes I plan on only introducing at most 1 product a week. I bought full size instead of getting samples and this was not a suggested or smart decision. My skin like many others may very well prefer a simple cleanser, essence, serum, moisturiser routine instead of actives and multiple layers of essences so I need to be aware that even if I can handle individual products, having too much can have negative instead of beneficial effects. This again ties into my decision to purchase everything. Please don't do what I'm doing. But also please understand that I never believed any of the product would work without trying (and to only incorporate them slooowly).**\n\nHopefully this is not a just a newbie post but an introduction as I plan on contributing to this subreddit.\n\nHello beautiful people. \n\nBefore finding this subreddit my skincare routine of the last however many years consisted of... a cleanser (Cetaphil) and a moisturizer (Cerave cream)... I use them based on how I feel or what I \"anticipate\". The one constant is washing my face twice daily while taking a hot shower (drying I know).\nI do remember asking my dermatologist if there's other things I should try and incorporate what moisturizer to use (at this time I didn't use the Cerave lol). His response was \"none of those things do anything. yaoming.png\" It's been 3 years since I took any antibiotics or accutane (didn't need to finish my course).  \n\nBasically, regarding skincare and routines I went from \"Earth is round\" to Advanced Physics. But I was determined. I approached this as I would building a gym routine or getting my macros down. So I read the entire sidebar plus corresponding comments and seasonal HG threads. This also lead to many many blogposts in which I found their beginners guide and commentary invaluable. Sometimes I would have to google and tag reddit+asianbeauty to find what I wanted. I'm not sure if I would suggest the research-read-read-read-research approach for other total newbies as it took me an inordinate amount of hours.\nI'm still a newbie but I did my due diligence. However my earlier metaphor is a warning that no matter how much knoooooowledge I digest I'm still a 1st grader. \n\n\nOther info:\n\nI'm 20, male and not really concerned with anti-aging or wrinkles. My skin is currently **dehydrated/combination (oily/dry) and sensitive.** Dealt with Acne (maybe still am) and took antibiotics for it years ago (regret this).  \nI'm in Vancouver, BC so the weather is nice and mild (but expensive af). I'm not sure if my skin is classified as acne-prone but my **concerns are REDNESS (PIE), and PORES (large, clogged)** specifically whiteheads that appear at the start/end of the day and gone on their own after a hot shower.\nSometimes a pimple reoccurs at the same spot. Please let me know if the routine I have made is suitable and geared towards me. Obviously a lot of my decisions were based off of what I have learned here and blogs (awesome but not my exact demographic). \n\nAnyways here is the routine I've laboured and applied many hours into. Please give me your opinion (no sugarcoating). \n**All comments are greatly appreciated. It doesn't have to answer my question. It will help to interact with everyone for once as I've been reading your comments all this time and gaining dat TaiLopezKnawwwledge.**\n\n\n##The Routine##\n\nBold italics just means that the product is exclusively for and unique to either AM or PM not both.\nEverything is daily unless specified.\n\nAM:\n\n1.

Some of which have arrived (Amazon Prime), some will take awhile. If I made a mistake on buying certain things please please please let me know, I don't regret it and it will help me immensely (ex: I can ask what you think of my backups which is in an excel sheet).\t\t\t\n\nI also bought **Now Foods Rose Hip Seed Oil** (suggest which hydrator or occlusive to add 2 drops to and in the AM, PM or both)\n\n\n##Newbie Questions\t\n\n- Did you cringe?\n- Is it better for my skin if I use the oil cleanser minimally instead of daily if I'm only wearing sunscreen.\n- How do you guys keep your hands sanitized while applying layers? (if I'm applying oil with dry hands and dry face do you just grab any normal soap)  \n- AM and PM differences in moisturizing (hydrators and occlusive). Keep same or?\n- Are some of these products redundent within my routine.\n- Looking to even out my skintone as I have redness from acne but not look pale (not judging but it'll look weird when the rest of my body is a different tint).  \n- IOPE and hadalabo toner both have hyaluric acid is this a concern especially when I'm layering both one after the other? \n- I'm used to cleansing my face in the shower and applying Cerave cream on it wet to seal in the moisture. With this routine I'll be applying actives after cleansing so will this make my hydrators step less ideal since it'll be on dry?\n- Leejiham Tea Tree 90 Essence or COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence first?\n- Should I skip the occlusive in the AM or PM?\n- Wait time between hydrators \n- Items to store in the fridge (besides Vit C), I read sheet masks and the COSRX Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask?\n\nThank you for taking the time. **I would really like to SEE ANY comments** whether they be suggestions, critiques, answers, rants, feedbacks or musings please direct them here! Feel free to say whatever is on your mind.    \n\nI will do a haul when I receive all the items and post a before and after picture of my cabinet lel, as well as give me initial impressions.\n\n**Also I know the actives wait time and I will be incorporating 1 product a week and taking it slow per sidebar teachings**",

Like I've been seeing it develop, but there are a lot of hard and fast opinions floating around here that are pretty unfair.  \n\nOnce you get the sunscreen -> cleanse down I see no reason you couldn't add the Cosrx BHA every other day, and then every day if your skin responded well.  It's very gentle, I don't know why people are acting like you bought a 60% glycolic solution right out of the gate.  It *could* cause purging, but an active can cause purging at any time in your AB life.\n\nAlso, all the people who are budget shaming you need to back right the fuck off.  I don't know what your story is, that could be a totally reasonable initial investment in a hobby for you.  If it's gonna be hard to pay the rent, buy groceries or save for your rainy day fund though, maybe don't do it again.\n\nIn the same category - I personally think buying samples and *especially decants* is a crap shoot for the total beginner.  Ebay sellers, unknown expiration dates *or* negotiating the AB exchange and telling someone on Reddit where you live.  Is it possible that some of the products you bought won't work for your skin? of course.  But that will happen throughout your AB journey and I do not understand why people are shaming you for buying full-size out-the-gate.\n\nNo, I didn't cringe.  My only comment is that the moisturizing mask might be a little heavy for daytime.",

        "body": "Welcome to AB! :D\n\n1. No I did not cringe, but I do have some advice.\n\n2. Use oil cleansing everyday in your PM routine, even if you only wear sunscreen. Oil cleansing is actually beneficial to the skin as it removes all your daily gunk better than a foam cleanser alone, so don't worry about harming your skin with it.\n\n3. Don't obsess over keeping your hands clean, as its really impossible to completely avoid cross contamination. Your hands get clean when you cleanse in the beginning of your routine, so after that just avoid doing extraneous activities. Start and finish your routine and try not to get distracted. The use of spatulas helps when applying products from tub containers. My point is, don't stress it.\n\n4. For the AM, people usually go lighter and often don't bother with an occlusive. Its about finding the balance between dry and impractically sticky for daytime. Depending on your skin needs, just apply your Green Tea Lotion or your Cosrx Honey Mask.\n\nFor PM, you want to pile on the layers, cause it doesn't matter if your skin is super sticky at night! I would do everything hydrating then.\n\n5. You don't need 2 different foam cleansers. Either the Innisfree or the Hadalabo would do. You also may decide to use the A-Sol as a toner. I do this and I find its most effective when combating acne. In which case, you can choose between the Cosrx Toner and the A-Sol (ie. save money!).\n\n6. Not really a question, but don't worry. No products will lighten your skin so dramatically that it looks strange compared to your body. What you'll likely notice is a brightness to your skin, not a whiteness.\n\n7. Nope, the more the merrier! As long as you're putting other products on top of your hyaluronic acid products, you'll be sitting pretty. The hyaluronic acid pulls in moisture from the atmosphere (ie. your layered products), which helps to better absorb succeeding products. Conversely, were you to put nothing on top, it would suck the moisture out of your skin into the atmosphere, which is not so nice. Diffusion, osmosis, science; gotta love it.\n\n8. With all the products you'll be applying, your skin won't dry out on you. If you start to feel dry for some reason between steps, just mist your face with some water. Your moisturizers will still be effective.\n\n9. Thinnest to thickest consistency. If they have the same consistency, which product do you want to be more effective? The closer to the beginning of your routine, the better a product will be absorbed.\n\n10. Probably don't need an occlusive in the AM, but who knows? Winter can be very drying and many find that a sleeping pack used during the day prevents dryness. YMMV.\n\n11. The only things that have definite wait times are actives. For all other products, just wait a minute or two until they absorb and then apply the next layer.\n\n12. You can store sheet masks in the fridge if you want them cold on your skin. I personally find them cold at room temperature, so I don't do that. Everything else should be fine in dry, room temperature storage.\n\nAlso, just a random tip. You don't have to use so many products in your AM routine. This may be overwhelming for you if you have early school/work. Also, this may leave your face sticky during the day. Just go with what your face feels like it needs that day. Don't feel like you have to use every product in your routine every day.\n\nAlso, add the primrose oil to your Innisfree lotion.\n\nI wish you luck and feel free to ask questions!\n\nEDIT: ignore the weird number order lol",

        "body": "Soo before all of this your whole routine was just Cetaphil cleanser and Cerave moisturizer? If so it was REALLY risky buying full size products of everything without knowing what ingredients might make you react badly especially if you're acne prone @_@ there are a lot of sites that sell sample packs for this reason and /r/asianbeautyexchange where you can request decants of products. But since the damage is done, I would work on your dehydrated skin before introducing anything else. Adding steps to a routine should only be done if the routine is solid to begin with. I'd only start with your cleansers, *maybe* one hydrating essence, the Cerave you're currently using while you patch test, and sunscreen. Some points to consider:        \n\n- Absolutely NO actives for a long while    \n- Bija cleansing gel and hada labo foaming cleanser serve the same purpose     \n- A lot of the products you bought might be HGs for a lot of people but there also many people who react badly to them     \n- You need a 1st cleanser if you wear sunscreen but again, oil cleansing is not for everyone so be careful      \n- Anything other than Vit C is optionally stored in fridge depending on your preference      \n\n\nA lot of people already answered so I'll stop there but your AM routine looks a bit complicated. YMMV but I usually just splash my face with water, one essence, one moisturizer, sunscreen and done. Good luck :S",

(if I'm applying oil with dry hands and dry face do you just grab any normal soap)\n\nAgain, speaking from my own experience I don't bother sanitising between layers...but I also minimise touching other surfaces and do an alcohol wipe down of all skin care containers once every two week or so. More frequently for spatulas and such when using them.\n\n> AM and PM differences in moisturizing (hydrators and occlusive). Keep same or?\n\n\nGenerally occlusive are reserved for night time usage because they can make skin looks shiny/oily...but some people do use them during daytime too depending on their skin requirements.\n\nSo ymmv.

Personally, that is a lot of money to me, but I totally get that it's reasonable for some people. If you can do it, go for it. If it strains your budget, then you've learned a good lesson and I'm sure you won't do it again. Pretty simple. It's a lot of product, but it certainly isn't money wasted. You will learn a lot about what your skin does and does not like, and if you end up with products that don't work for you, you can certainly gift them or sell them on the AB exchange at some later date. \n\nYes, we tell newbies not to feel like they have to haul hard to be a part of the sub, but that doesn't mean they absolutely should not haul. You have clearly put a lot of time and thought into your routine curation and I think that's awesome. c:\n\nAs for the acid situation, I usually just recommend waiting until you *know* your sunscreen and oil cleansers work well with your skin because you **must** be diligent about sunscreen application. I also usually recommend starting with a BHA first, because it tends to not cause hellacious purging in the same way AHAs tend to. Introducing them in that order optimizes your chances of getting through actives with minimal scarring/PIE from purging. Also, I'm sure you've been told this a billion times already, but just be mindful of how your skin is looking and feeling as you start using actives! Overexfoliation sucks and causes more damage in the long run. You seem to be off to a good start, but if you need help let us know!\n\nThe only thing I see is that your CosRx honey mask might be too heavy for daytime. I would make sure it plays well with your sunscreen (doesn't pill up, sinks in okay, etc.). If not, I think you could add a couple of drops of that rose hip oil to your honey AIO or Innisfree lotion and that might be enough for your daytime skin. If you find that the CosRx honey mask doesn't work well for the daytime, I'd suggest the CosRx rice mask instead. I know the texture of that one is a bit lighter. \n\nKeep us updated on how it goes!",

Different ingredients have varying levels of occlusivity. For example, some occlusive oils include olive oil, mineral oil, squalene, and rice bran oil.

However I feel like your really heavy on the 'acne' products. Like having a spot treatment is great to keep on hand but imho the master patch would just be overkill. You have to remember that if say, this routine worked synergistically together right off the bat (which is unlikely but we can always hope for the best) with the proper pore care you wouldn't really have to use the spot treatment very often at all and the master patch would seem almost silly to do. For instance I was doing something for my pores about twice a week and could never really keep them as clean and clear as I wanted (my routine was off!) I added retinol and other cell turnover products into my routine and I forgot the last time i've had to do a pore patch or anything along those lines. \n\nDid I cring? \nYeah for most others reason as well, you have no established routine and you're heading into it like this. Just sometimes something unforeseen can come up like for instance I had a client do something relatively similar to this. She had the occasional breakout and flipped out and wanted to change her routine up (not saying that is similar) but she still incorporated products one by one and realized she was unhappy with many of them and soon got overwhelmed because she would like 'product A' but when she used that 'product B' would be too much moisture. Or 'A' and 'C' worked well but using 'B' too caused a lot of irritation. Skincare is on a continuum. One thing may come and stay. One thing may go and nothing takes its place. Two may come and none go. etc. etc. \n \nAlso going about Skincare like a gym routine seems off and wrong and why I think there's a huge potential for you to waste a lot of money. Skincare I believe is like an art. Treat it as such. It takes practice. A LOT of practice. Trial and Error. Bad reactions. Amazing results you can't wait to show everyone. Sounds fluffy and annoying I know but I've worked in the industry for years and had a passion for skincare even longer than that. I've come to realize to take a load off. Set up a killer BASIC routine and start adding slowly but smartly. You'll have to 'listen' to your skin with products notice changes in it and these can sometimes let you see potential issues like \"my skins feeling a little dryish since I added 'product A' I don't know if its a great idea to add this \"another-astringent-product'\". Not sure if ANY of that even makes sense LOL. But I wish you good luck in your skincare journey. Just remember to take a little load off. This isn't the gym, it's a different type of happy place. The one you get to relax and indulge. I've gotten numerous people from bar soap to routines that are as extensive as yours but it takes time.",

The products I think are the most redundant are:\n\n1) CosRX AHA/BHA Toner\n\nYou might not need that especially since both of the cleansers you want to use already have a low pH. If after you start your actives, you find that you need a higher efficacy, then you can buy it. A lot of people find that actives everyday can be too much and even that they need to wash it off after a certain amount of time or it'll affect their skin barrier.\n\n2) IOPE First Essence\n\nTry the other essences first. You already will have two other essences, a moisturizing toner, and an emulsion.\n\n3) Lotion/Cream\n\nThis becomes YMMV but I find on my skin (similar type) that I really don't need too many occlusives because that just causes clogged pores. Oily, dehydrated skin usually needs more hydration and then just one occlusive on top to seal it in. You may find that you won't need both the emulsion and overnight mask.\n\nNext time you want to try out many different things, I highly recommend checking out the Asianbeautyexchange reddit. Hauling big like this can get expensive and if something doesn't work out for you, you're stuck with the full-size.

        "body": "I started building this pond by hand about a month ago- late November 2024. I knew I wanted to as natural as possible with the sealant so I only briefly considered EPDM before looking to alternatives and eventually settling on bentonite clay (Dr. Elsey's cat litter- 2 35lb bags).\n\nGoals are primarily to serve as a water hub for the local ecosystem, especially after noticing how significantly the recent drought dried up all nearby water sources including most small streams like the ones in my neighborhood. I'd also like to host native plant species in a neighborhood dominated by grass, ornamental plants, and invasive species besides the trees. Creating shelter for native reptiles is also high up in my priorities, so I set up some basking rocks and hides. I will be creating more hides with plants come spring. Ultimately, I'd like to revitalize a sad lawn covered with Indian strawberry, hairy bittercress, and patches of grass/clover here and there to something more usable to the wildlife around me.\n\nI do not intend to have crystal clear water or host fish unless they get dropped off by a bird by accident (besides maybe mosquito fish) but I would like frogs and toads to show up this spring. Since it's been only a couple weeks and very cold, so far nobody has taken interest yet besides a wide variety local birds, a couple rabbits, squirrels, the neighborhood cat, and earth worms (that have been messing up my clay liner). No aquatic plants added yet besides local marginal mosses and some duckweed that disappeared overnight the the day right after it was added. Will be adding hornworts, white lilies, and more duckweed closer to spring as well as planting native grasses and milkweeds around the perimeter and blue flag iris and such more towards the marginal area.\n\nOur soil here is mostly silty and sandy on top, being where coastal meets piedmont. Fortunately, it also has regions famous for being clay-heavy near the numerous creeks and rivers where I live. The clay heavy soil is about 12-24\" down here and held water decently well without liner, however the siltier/sandier layers on top of that are highly porous. I used the poor quality clay heavy soil around the perimeter of the pond to stifle the grass and invasive species that have taken up residence around the lawn. I then topped it with the top layer of the lawn that I chopped and mixed into a loamy topsoil. I covered that with leaf litter, then organic hardwood mulch (that was already colonized by lots of mycelium!) for the current topmost layer. Ideally this will help discourage growth of any seeds or intact plants from the top layer of lawn and turn into a compost of sorts as the growing season approaches.\n\nI did a water seepage test with the bentonite clay in a plastic container and it didn't spill a single drop no matter how long I left it- but only after compacted. Here's the thing- I was only able to compact the bentonite so much until it started raining the night I was supposed to have it finished. I got it laid down and dispersed adequately in time, just wasn't able to compact it without it being too squishy to avoid displacement. I compacted the natural red clay before adding the bentonite, mostly in the deeper region (about 24\" at the deepest to 12\") and around the upper \"lip\" to help mitigate erosion.\n\nThe pond has been holding water for about 2 weeks now. The water level has pretty consistently stayed around half full, despite filling it all the way up with dechlorinated hose water for the first time a few days ago. This leads me to believe the water pressure adequately compacted most of the clay on the bottom, but the top layers need some support. It's been freezing and wet the past couple days but should be warming up throughout the week here. Should I leave it to natural processes of freezing/thawing and compaction via water pressure/wildlife or should I get in there and do it by hand as much as possible, even though I risk displacing some of the clay in doing so?\n\nI'm ultimately happy with how the pond is coming together and could see it becoming a keystone hub in my area over the next year once sufficient plants are added and the clay is sufficiently compacted.\n\nI'm open to suggestions on how to better meet my goals and any advice from bentonite users would be greatly appreciated!",

    "body": "\n###About my hair\n\nKinky/curly\nFine strands and dense (thick)\nStopped relaxing my hair in 15 years ago and been on a natural hair journey the whole time. \n\n\n###Length of my experiment so far\n\nI found the distilled water sub randomly last year November 2023 while traveling. I wanted to start right away so I used bottled water to wash my hair using a squeeze bottle. \n\nSince I started my natural hair journey, I‚Äôve tried all sorts of hair routines. I‚Äôm used to washing outside the shower with a squeeze bottle. I also used Ayurveda treatments to wash - hibiscus, cassia, bentonite clay and other Ayurvedic powders and also apple cider vinegar rinses. I also already experimented with different hair washing schedules: once a week, very few days, once a month, or longer stretches. I tried water-only, tea and herbal rinses for shampoo, and cowashing only.\n\nWhen I decided to stop using tap water, I used bottled water for the first few months while traveling until I was able to purchase distilled water. \n\n###Motivation behind my experiment\n\nI want to do less on my hair. Natural hair care usually involves a lot of steps and treatments but I‚Äôm determined to figure out a real wash and go routine. Or at least a wash and not-do-anything-for-a-while routine. \n\nAnd I want long hair so I can put it up out of the way easier. I find long kninky curly hair is easier to take care of because I don‚Äôt want to go to a salon regularly. \n\n###Type of water I'm experimenting with\n\nDistilled water from the store. \n\n###Tap water that I was using previously \n\nI have no idea but I‚Äôm sure it was hard water because my hair used to have strong orange overtones. And shampoo didn‚Äôt lather much. \n\n###How strict?\n\nI don‚Äôt use any tap water on my hair at all. \n\n###Changes in my hair and scalp so far\n\nHair changes\n\nMost of the changes are how my hair feels so the photos don‚Äôt show the changes well. My hair in the before picture is after a twist out and with lots of product. The middle picture is after washing. And the last picture is a random photo I took of my slept-on, not washed in weeks hair so I could have a more recent comparison photo. \n\nMy family tells me my hair is darker and healthier looking. My sister asked if I dyed it. \n\nMy hair is softer and clumps more into a curl pattern without me using any product or manipulation (like twisting or braiding). It hangs more without me stretching it. It has almost no frizz. \n\nBefore, when I Did The Most and followed natural hair routines, hair products didn‚Äôt work for me. Using conditioner made my hair harder and frizzier. Water didn‚Äôt make my hair wet. Gel made my hair break off. I was sure I had low porosity hair and protein-sensitive hair which meant more work - not what I wanted. \n\nSo I switched to Ayurveda practices and water-only with sebum and saw some improvement. But distilled water makes my hair do what I thought was impossible - it‚Äôs curly without trying. It clumps without trying. It doesn‚Äôt get bone dry and brittle even when I put off washing my hair for too long. I can put it in a bun and then wear it down the next day. It‚Äôs pliable and stronger. The strands feel thicker. \n\n###My current favorite hair cleaning method\n\nCurrently, I wash about once a month with distilled water and watered down shampoo and conditioner. If my scalp feels dry, I may do a water-only rinse mid-month. \n\nI try to oil my hair and scalp nightly but sometimes forget. I didn‚Äôt comb for over a year and only finger-detangled as an experiment but I‚Äôm going to start combing again at least once a month. \n\n###Details about how I wash my hair\n\nI use the squeeze bottle method, my old method from Ayurvedic hair treatments.\n\n I tried dunking but it used way too much water. So I went back to the squeeze bottle after it was mentioned here. \n\nFor water rinses - I mix ACV with distilled water in one bottle and rinse my scalp and hair. If my ends feel dry and need extra conditioning, I mix conditioner with water in the other one and use on my ends. \n\nFor shampoo washes - same as above but I use watered-down shampoo to wash my scalp. I honestly prefer ACV rinses so do less of the shampoo washes. \n\n###My wash frequency \n\nMonthly-ish \n\n###Water amount per wash\n\nI refill my 8 oz squeeze bottle about 2 times per rinse. And the conditioner/shampoo 4 oz bottle I fill about halfway and sometimes don‚Äôt use all of it in one wash. \n\n###My favorite hair styling method\n\nI like simple and avoid styles that pull on my scalp. My main styles are \nFlat twisted in sections and worn in low ponytails or under a beanie\nPull it on top of my head with a scarf - like a loose pineapple\nWorn loose in an afro \n\nI don‚Äôt really do manipulated styles anymore like twist outs or braid outs because those caused more serious tangles than just wearing my hair loose. My current flat twists are very loose, not tight so I don‚Äôt stretch my hair much. \n\n###My favorite products and hair tools\n\nMy only hair products are fats/oils (MCT, Avocado, tallow), ACV, watered -down conditioner, and distilled water. Sometimes I make a tea rinse or add an essential oil to the rinse water. \n\n\n",

Then I remembered I had some oregano essential oil.\n\nI mixed 5 drops of oregano essential oil in a tablespoon of olive oil. I spot tested it on my inner arm before putting in on my scalp. It was good to go. (Btw, the oregano/olive oil mix greatly reduced this persistent rash on my inner arm that I've had for over a month. I can barely see it now).\n\nI massaged my scalp with my water/vinegar/clove essential oil mix and then rinsed my scalp. Afterwards, I applied the remainder of bentonite clay from Sunday night to my scalp. After that I rubbed my scalp with the oregano essential oil/olive oil mix. \n\nToday, September 6, I woke up to my scalp with a big improvement over yesterday (upset right pic). I sprayed my scalp with my water mix and massaged my scalp. Then I washed my scalp with Head and Shoulders shampoo with a tiny bit of oregano essential oil added. It burned.

Some kind of light occlusive in the morning (like an oil) to finish your AM routine so that the moisture or hydration you just put in stays in, and a strong occlusive in the evening to finish the PM routine before going to bed (like vaseline, aquaphor, which are super sealing but sticky).\n* for anti-aging, tretinoin seems to be a no brainer from all the recommedations I've read here. I'm gonna start with 0.025% tretinoin cream, probably will start like twice a week, then every other day and then every evening depending on how my skin takes it. If all goes well, my plan is to go up to 0.05%, however apparently both 0.025% and 0.05% have the same anti-aging benefits but the 0.05% is better against acne (which would be good for me).\n* for anti-aging, once your skin is adapted to tret, you could consider adding vitamin C or some other actives, also nianicamides for skin brightening, peptides etc.\n\nGood luck! We're gonna nail this!\n\nedit: you may want to look at products you already have at home (and maybe forgot!) and see if they can fit in a new routine, before completing them with other products. Who knows you may already have great stuff that you could reintroduce to a routine and follow through.",

    "body": "To all my moldies, this ones for you. :)\n\nI know exactly what your going through! Please don‚Äôt lose hope. I myself have been out of mold for a while not but still struggle with lingering symptoms that seem to flare when doing certain things like eating lots of sugars and junk foods, or lifting weights. Take it easy and make sure your regulating your nervous system by grounding and de stressing as much as possible. Most of the issues caused by mold don‚Äôt come from the mold itself, the come from the LACK of nutrients your assimilating because the mycotoxins are robbing you blind. If you can‚Äôt move out right now thats understandable but try and stay out the house as much as possible and only be there to sleep. I‚Äôd also sleep with a mold mask on.\n\nWhat you can also do is try an elimination diet. Most people who are affected by mold tend to develop sensitivities to certain foods, including the very sulfur rich foods that are needed to actually detox the toxins. Sulfur sensitivities are bad news because it means your avoiding them and thus producing less glutathione as sulfur is a precursor. If that‚Äôs the case and you can‚Äôt handle those foods I‚Äôd suggest taking molybdenum as mold depletes that too, thus causing the sensitivities to sulfur.\n\nI‚Äôd also suggest taking lots of vitamin C because what that‚Äôll do is take the heavy hits from the mold, thus sparing your glutathione to do the simpler clean up work.\n\nYour also gonna be low in vitamin D and zinc most likely and potentially iron and B12.. hence the eye bags seen on us moldies as well as the tingles and nerve/vision issues. So it check those levels and supplement with those :)\n\nAlso. Mold attacks the myelin sheath so taking vitamin B1 as benfotiamine starting out at a dose of 15mg to avoid paradoxical reactions can massively help. Also start slow with magnesium oil like a few sprays and after a week up the sprays. B1 and magnesium work together to produce ATP, a thing that mold heavily disrupts, thus explaining the chronic fatigue and muscle weakness :) so take those and make sure your supplementing small amounts of creatine everyday. (2-3 grams) this as well as CoQ10 will hugely benefit you and ramp up your body‚Äôs ATP production.\n\nWhat‚Äôs also important to remember is that during this whole process, our detox organs (kidneys, liver and lymphatic system) will be taking a pounding trying to rid this stuff from our body, so it‚Äôs important to include liver and kidney support. I like milk thistle for the liver but make sure your correcting any iron deficiencies first because milk thistle can lower your iron absorption. And for the kidneys I like nettle seed teas and parsley teas. As for the lymphatic system make sure your rebounding everyday so that the toxins can be brought out easily. It your struggling to poop chia seeds and flax can help lol.\n\nJust remember avoidance is key. With mold, your winning when your detoxing faster than your receiving. So staying out of mold and pounding the toxins with all the things I just said while keeping your detox organs strong is truly a winning combo.\n\nOh I forgot. Eat 3 organic Brazil nuts a day for the selenium as mold robs that, and also beef up your iodine intake. I like nori sea weed with sardines in them. This provides me with the iodine, selenium and lots of Omega 3 which is crucial for lowering the inflammation caused by the mycotoxins. You also get natural calcium from the bones.\n\nIncorporating turmeric and black pepper with meals can help hugely as well due to the fact that curcumin is potently anti inflammatory. Black seed oil also. \n\nAs for binders I‚Äôd do 4 okras (boiled for just 3 minutes) 2 hours before your first meal of the day. Okra binds to mycotoxins and pulls them out, so that‚Äôs the first binder. Second binder I would do bentonite clay, quarter teaspoon in some water an hour before bed time. These are very simple and gentle binders but act potent when combined with all of the above. \n\nRemember it‚Äôs not about going tooo heavy on attacking the mold it‚Äôs more about supporting the body‚Äôs natural abilities and powers to detox and do what it‚Äôs been so sophisticatedly designed to do, which is keep you alive. \n\nHope this helps! üòÅ",

Bentonite has a negative charge and so will cling to positively charged proteins/bits, you may want to add a positively charged clarifying agent as a double whammy. Personally, I like to use both Kiselsol (negative charge) and Chitosan (positive charge) to expedite the clarification of my mead, it works exceptionally well. \n\nIf in the future you are looking to add fruit to a brew add in some pectin, that‚Äôll help break down the proteins in the fruit. Alternatively you can also make a simple syrup by boiling down fruit in sugar water & straining the crap out of it. \n\nSeriously though that colour looks AMAZING.

The real art of making mead is in balancing the three aspects of sweetness/acid/tannin. But then aging helps also.  Let your batch bulk age for a few months.

If age doesn‚Äôt help, the other question is what kind of honey did you use?\n\nIn my opinion for a traditional mead the quality of the honey REALLY matters. I have made quite a four, 2 were okay/average (melter‚Äôs honey), 1 was terrible (local Texas wildflower honey), and 1 was phenomenal (Florida orange blossom honey). Basically same recipe, the only exception was one of the melter‚Äôs honey used a different yeast. All fermented to completion and aged a year, no back sweetening or balancing (as I back sweeten and balance in the glass unless it‚Äôs an established recipe). The orange blossom needed nothing, it was perfect as is, the melter‚Äôs honey benefitted from some back sweetening, but there is nothing that could have saved that wildflower honey. \n\nWhen I initially sampled the wildflower honey, I thought it tasted fine, seemed like standard wildflower honey to me, nothing special but not bad. After sampling the mead, I went back and resampled the wildflower honey used, and noted some faint bitter notes I did not previously notice. If I didn‚Äôt try the mead, I don‚Äôt think I would have picked up on it when sampling the honey.",

Things have been pretty busy for me over the last four weeks. I'll cut to the chase as far as the numbers go an then explain them in more detail:\n\nAs for sales, they were down 49% from April to May.\n\nAlthough this may seem pretty disappointing, there were a number of factors that contributed to this which will comprise nearly this entire post:\n\n1) The digital marketing agency I was working with basically disappeared on me. We had agreed that Facebook ads were not turning any ROI and wanted to pivot to Instagram influencers instead which were showing good ROI. For a day or two, they sent out a few requests to potential influencers and then pretty much vanished. After not hearing from them or seeing any work they were doing for about a week and a half, I figured it was time to head our separate ways. I never heard from them again. \n\nAs a result of this, I had little to no advertising going on. Traffic to my site plummeted. At the same time, I ended up having to have two emergency medical procedures done and in the times leading up to them, I was basically useless for a good two week time period.\n\n2) This one will be a learning experience for anyone just starting out as to what NOT to do with influencers. With my advertising budget being extremely limited, I am currently trying to devote about $50 a month to paying Instagram influencers. I found one at the end of April that was really interested in my products, requested two samples and seemed like a good fit. She had 227k followers and wanted $50 to run a story for me. After sending out the samples, I did'nt hear from her for about a week and a half and so, I reached out to her. She said she got the products and wanted to know when I wanted her to run her story. We agreed on the potential days she would post it and what my guidelines for her to talk about were and then sent her over the $50 via PayPal. The two days she's supposed to post go by and there is no post. Another week goes by and no posts as well. I reached out to her to find out if she's finally planning to do them and never hear anything from her on my repeated attempts. At this point I would rather just get my money back because the last thing I want is to be hounding someone and then have them run a post they feel compelled to do. I messaged her that if I didn't hear from her by the end of the weekend I would be requesting my money back and would take further action as necessary. Never heard from her, requested my money back. She denied the request without providing reason. Now, here's where I learned my real mistake. I filed a dispute with PayPal who then also denied my claim because I sent the money as \"friends and family\" instead of \"goods and services\" and you can't dispute \"friends and family\" transactions. Great. She totally scammed me out of my $50. My only recourse at this point was to go find all the companies that sponsor her and send them an email voicing my displeasure over the people they have representing them and explaining what she did to me. I think I sent out 25 emails. I heard back from 8 of them who either told me they had no relationship with her, actually have turned her away after learning some things they could never approve of or were in the process of distancing themselves from her! Anyways, she must have gotten a bunch of flak from these companies because two days later, she refunded me. I thought it was over at that point but the next morning she direct messaged me on IG and told me that if I sent one more email to the companies she works with that she was going to bash me to her 227k followers and take legal action in the form of libel and slander because I was being incredibly unprofessional. Whaaat?! I should have not said anything but, I put her in her place and she ended up blocking me. MORAL OF THE STORY: Always pay influencers through the \"goods and services\" method!\n\nSo, I believe this strongly impacted my sales numbers because it tied up my advertising budget and accounted for a 157% ROI in my last paid gig. I expected more out of this one because she had a larger following, more engagement and there was an overlap between the audiences which would have, I believe, resulted in an additional exposure and social proof to that audience. I do now have the money back and am looking for new potential partners for this month.\n\nWhile I'm on the Instagram kick here, I've had a number of micro-infleuncers who I've sent free products to with the understanding that they would put up a post and they never do. Even after checking in with them and they say they love the product and I ask for the return post, they go cold and never put it up. Is there any tips you all might have to ensure that posts get posted? Do I have to start doing contracts with people? How does that go over usually? I have also considered some sort of small profit sharing with them on their posts? Any suggestions?\n\n3) In response to some of the great feedback I got on my last update, I have spent a lot of time focusing on some behind the scenes things to help improve my business in the long run. For one, as many of you have suggested, I started a blog. My intention is to post something about every 10 days. I did some keyword research and have a list of topics that get between 1k-10k searches a month and have low competition. I have also added in the capability on Google Analytics to track the keywords that people type in where my site comes up and have noticed some patterns and searches where I rank pretty low but would like to rank much higher - for example \"bentonite clay deodorant\" I'm like 70 and there aren't many, if any bentonite clay deodorants out there. As far as long tailed keywords, I can't really figure out how to search them. Whenever I type them into keyword planner, I never get results have have more than 4 words in them. How do I do this?\n\nOrganic traffic on my site converts at a 4.91% rate right now and I would really like to focus on this much more than I am. I have been thinking of re-directing my Facebooks ad money over to Google AdWords. Is this something that I should do or is it too complex of a game and will I be wasting my money there too?\n\nI also went through the process of upgrading my Shopify theme which resulted in much crisper images and some enhanced functionality. \n\n4) I was considering entering into the retail foray but was convinced that Amazon would probably be the better avenue in terms of exposure. Amazon, for me, has been a frustrating and complex procedure. Of course, I paid the $40 fee to be a seller right off the bat. I got a few of my products listed and then the next day when I went to try to sign them up for FBA, I was denied because they needed a hazardous materials exemption. I then had to figure out how to fill out the firms for the exemption only to find out that because they are a \"topical\" I have to be approved by Amazon to sell them. In order to be approved you need one of four documents, none of which I had. The most logical of them for me was FDA registration - which I am not required to have by the FDA because my products do not contain coloring or antiperspirants. I did find out that it is free to sign up for the FDA voluntary registration. It took 6 days for the FDA to send me an email granting me permission to sign up for an account. I then have to wait for them to send me another email granting me permission to fill out their 2511 form to get registered and I have been waiting a week for that so far. It's been a little disappointing and frustrating to have all these roadblocks in place but, I think its something I've come to get used to as a business owner now.\n\nI think many of you will have your experiences with FBA both good and bad and I would love to hear them. I hear a lot of negative about it. For me, right now, I will actually make 31 cents more per sale of one stick going through FBA than through my site and that is due entirely to the fact that I offer free shipping. I would however, make more money on the sale of two sticks on my web page than I will through Amazon. It'll be a volume game and more exposure for me...I'm hoping.\n\nThose are the factors I believe led to the decrease in sales. By no means am I discouraged at all.\n\nI have swung back into Facebook ads a little bit in the past few weeks. My first campaign led to a pretty disappointing $13 CAC but would have the potential of a $44 CLV but, I need to get better at my ads. I just don't really know if spending money on FB ads is worth it at this point.\n\nIn some other disappointing news, I had filed to register my logo with the USPTO before I launched and received news that it had been rejected for likelihood of confusion. Apparently there is a Green Theory company in Colorado that sells vitamins and supplements. We don't have the same logo or anything that closely resembles it whatsoever but the attorney felt like deodorant and supplements are too closely related and so now I'm kind of stuck wondering how to proceed. I'm going to email the attorney and try to state my case. I have six months to do so but will be doing it ASAP. I don't have the money to hire an attorney to do it for me right now. Does anyone have experience with these types of rejection responses. Any advice out there?\n\nI recently applied to get a booth at a local farmers market and was accepted however, they're booked up for the season already so, I'm on standby and if they have an opening, I'm on the list. I would be elated to do even just one. I think it would be a great experience and opportunity to connect with potential customers. I've never done anything like it and so, it's a bit intimidating but, I've been through much more difficult experiences in life and have learned that fear is pretty much all in our heads.\n\nI think that's it for this update. I would love any feedback or critiques or thoughts. This has all been incredibly helpful for me and I'm so grateful for all of you that that offered your help!",

    "body": "I‚Äôm 22 years old, and I have normal skin. I don‚Äôt have any major skin issues, Just a little mascne and acne marks resulting from that.\n\nI see people do shelfies here all the time, so I wanted to hop on the bandwagon and review some products that my skin is in love with right now.\n\n1. LANEIGE Lip sleeping mask ‚Äì A huge shoutout to this for being the only lip care product I have finished a tub of (I‚Äôm someone who has used lip balms since middle school) Found this two years ago, can‚Äôt live without it now. It is PACKED with emollients and berry extracts. It makes my lips feel so soft and healthy! I also love that it smells like berries.\n2. DECONSTRUCT Breakout Control serum (3.3% Potassium Azeloyl Diglycenate) ‚Äì PAD is a better-tolerated derivative of Azelaic acid. I noticed that this, in combination with the salicylic acid serum from the same brand dried up my zits pretty quickly. It did wonders for my brother‚Äôs skin; his face is full of acne and blackheads.\n3. DECONSTRUCT Brightening serum (10% Niacinamide + 0.3% Alpha Arbutin) ‚Äì THIS ONE IS MY FAVOURITE. I‚Äôve already run out of my bottle. and definitely gonna repurchase it. This is my OG niacinamide atm I‚Äôve been using this regularly and I look like a glazed doughnut now. Feels like I have an Instagram filter on.\n4. DECONSTRUCT Exfoliating Serum (18% AHA + 2% BHA) I‚Äôve been using this as a chemical peel, I love how smooth my skin looks now. I‚Äôm so surprised that this didn‚Äôt irritate my skin at all. I use it twice a week in my pm routine. I follow up with a heavy-duty moisturizer because otherwise, my skin gets dry.\n5. PHOTOSTABLE sunscreen ‚Äì My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen to me. It is my ride or die sunscreen, and I don‚Äôt feel like trying any other‚Äôs because my skin loves it! It is a broad-spectrum chemical sunscreen that contains Uvinul MC 80 7.5%, Tinosorb M5.0%, Uvinul T 150 3.0%., Tinosorb S 2.8% and Uvinul A plus granular 2.5%\n6. AZTEC Indian healing clay mask ‚Äì I think it was the hype around this mask that started my obsession with skincare as a teenager. This mask contains bentonite clay, which is a popular HG when it comes to clay masks. It deeply cleanses my skin and It still remains to be my favourite way to detoxify my skin. This clay mask helped clear the acne marks I got when I was a teenager and reckless with my skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/swooll8xx3c71.jpg?width=1061&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cde1cdaf27bed5d002c5976fefe3e89fb990de6",

    "body": "I don't know if this has been done before,  so I apologize if it has.  But let's make a list of rituals that can be used to summon monsters, create items, curse people, seal evil away, etc.  They can be easy, or incredibly difficult, have 2 step or 200, but should require some work.  Here's an example:\n\n1. To summon the Ochlik, first you'll need to cut the tongue of someone who died of hunger. Then shove it, and five meals down their throat.  Wash it down with 5 bottles of the finest wine.  The person doing so must not have eaten for 24 hours before the ritual starts.  Upon completion the Ochlik will burst forth from the victims stomach.\n2. To create the Oathsworn Sword, First you will need a powerfully enchanted sword.  A cleric who worships the gods of either law, justice, or peace must pray over it for the entire day of both the summer and winter solstice. During each of these prayer days, the one looking to create an Oathsworn Sword must also spend the day reciting oaths to the chosen god that they will follow their tenets and serve to be the best example of their righteousness to the best of their abilities.  Finally, at the exact moment of sundown on each day, the recipient of the sword must shed one drop of blood onto the blade, and another on the hilt.  If the god approves, an Oathsworn Sword is created.\n3. To be accepted as an acolyte of Myril, the devotee must spend 3 days and nights fasting in darkness. Often the lowest level of a crypt is used, but any subterranean enclosure will serve. At noon on the 4th day, their face is washed with milk and they don the Black Shroud before being led, blind, up to the steps of the temple. If the sky is cloudy, they're turned away. If the day is clear, the shroud is removed, and the devotee gazes at the sun, maintaining continuous wide-eyed adoration as the ritual chant sounds and cymbals clash. After which, if they have not faltered, they may enter the temple for the first time.[u/RugiCorrino]\n4. To obtain audience with the Eversat, get ahold of 9 chairs, 7 effigies and an empty room with no windows. Total abscence of light from the exterior is not mandatory, as there have been succesful attempts to perform the ritual by shutting every opening sealed; however this is not recommended, as outcomes may vary. Arrange the chairs around the room in such a way that no seat faces the front or the back of any other seat. All chairs should be free, comfortable and in good conditions. Squeaks and creaks are historically not appreciated. Be sure to test the chairs in advance and NOT during the ritual. Once the layout is set, select one chair and address it elegantly and convincingly, gesturing with both hands towards it. Speak the following: \"For the guest\". From this point forward, do not touch or move this chair for any reason. With regular steps, proceed to address every chair in the room with the following formula: \"For X\". X stands for the name given to each effigy. After having said its name, place the designated effigy on the chair and repeat. Once left with only one free chair, slowly sit down. You might feel the chair bend under your weight. This is normal, maintain poise. If everything was performed correctly, the Eversat will gracefully demand your attention via sensory cues. Address it only after it has finished and conduct the audience thereon.[u/howlinghenbane]\n5. the morbid rite of ritual casting wildshape has been lost for eons and even then could only be done with a ritual with unpredictable consequences. On a moonless night the druid must kill the animal they wish to change into with two simultaneous arrows into their eyes that have been blessed by two gods of opposing alignment who favour that animal. They then have to carry the creatures body with them at all times, awake or asleep, until the next full moon. On the full moon the creature reanimates and will visciously hunt and attack the druid with the help of their brethren. Should the druid survive the night without harming the creature and being harmed in return, the creatures spirit surrenders and it disappears, leaving its skull behind. By carrying the skull, the druid can now wildshape into that creature at will, using regular ritual casting rules. However, their eyes will always have an unnatural glow about them in their animal form, setting them apart from regular animals and there is a small chance that this time when they transform, they will be blind and blinded by rage, attacking anyone near them until the duration of their transformation runs out.[u/AwkwardOwl17]\n6. A Blessing for the Scriptorium: on the darkest night of the year, light your clearest lamp with your cleanest oil. Cut fresh quills from white goose feathers or burn the oil off a freshly ground nib. Mix fresh ink, but add a drop of old, for new knowledge builds on what has come before.¬†On fresh vellum or parchment, offer Oghma your wishes or new learning. Offer illuminations and annotations. Those with great needs may offer fears or secrets, the truths of who they are. Then stitch your truth or your knowledge into the binding of a new book. May the layers of truth and hope, veiling and unveiling shelter those who serve knowledge inside Oghma‚Äôs walls.¬†[u/SgtWidget]\n7. To open the Vault of Shades: Take some iron and gold that the light of the sun has never reached. Five dwarven priests melt the metals while praying to any god of shadows. The metals are mixed and poured directly into the Vault's lock and left for 44 days, before the priests return to say the prayers once again and the door will open.[u/Terrs34]\n8. Worshipping the Black Lord - the pentagrams are drawn on the floor, it‚Äôs the just pentagrams made of coffee - a high insight check reveals that. And after a successful ritual the caster gets rewarded with a rare item, the endless coffee decanter, which allows you to brew unlimited (specialty) coffee without a need to add water or beans ü´ò[u/funin-dysfunctional]\n9. Ritual of River Watcher \nStep 1. Take rib from a magical creature. \nStep 2. Make your summoning circle to create a door for your patron.\nStep 3. Place the offering in running water over them.\nstep 4. carve the true name of your patron into the back of the offering using a sharpened rib.\nStep 5. Have the bloody water pool into a receptacle at the end of the running water's path.\nStep 6. While weilding the pooled water symbolizing the river of Styx, give sermon and allow the bloody river to flow down the individuals mouth.\nIf done properly the river will recede from the body spilling forth your dark Lord fresh from his voyage.[u/CheshaGurimu]\n10. Prepare the ritual grounds by leading both the sacrificial rooster and sacrificial bull nine times deosil each dawn and nine times widdershins each eve when moonrise would first occur starting at the new moon for nine days and nights.  The animals must eat only oats boiled in pregnant mare or sheep milk, and must drink only rainwater that has not touched the ground. Bathe thyself in holy water after fasting for nine days and nights, and break thy fast with blessed oat cakes, sweetened with honey, and boiled in the milk of a pregnant mare. Anoint thyself with blessed oils, and then apply a layer of ochre moistened with the fresh blood of a rooster upon thy entire skin, covering all parts evenly and completely.  Then apply a second layer made of a paste of bentonite clay, ground charcoal, and the fresh blood of a sanctified sacrificial bull.  For nine nights, culminating at the full moon, inhale the smoke of ground Hyoscyamus albus seeds and the dust of dried Tagetes lucida petals, after imbibing wine dosed with a tisane of Aconitum napellus root, and meditate upon the dream while spilling forth a willing sacrifice of blood split from thy tongue upon the pyrite spirit mirror, speaking the true name of that which you call, a spirit of death.  It will appear and serve you for a year and one day, and during that time you shall be unable to be killed, and death shall not take you. At the end of that period, that which you have called will attempt to kill you, but were you to prepare a substitute sacrifice of nine unsoiled humanoid souls, the spirit may be appeased.[u/MaxSizels]\n11. * If you've spoke no lies for a full year, no deceit for a full season, and no falsehood for a full day, all malicious tricks against you will turn on their perpetrator.[u/Mundovore]\n12. Swear an oath in the language of the Old Law to forsake all violence in all forms. For each year you hold your oath, your figure will stand unbowed against the blades and blows of the wicked at a time that it matters most, even the cruelest of blades shattering across your bare back.[u/Mundovore]\n13. If you learn the strange speech of the primordial crinoids, you can consort with them for a period of not less than two hours to learn their ways. They will not hear you unless you stand with your feet to the seabed in water deeper than you've stood at any point previously in your life. With one consultation and one moon of training, you can stand unmoving in the water against any current. After three moons and three consultations, you can move in a trance, perpetually resting as if asleep. After seven moons and seven consultations, you will no longer require air, food, or water, and will no longer suffer the pains of depth. After thirteen moons and nineteen consultations, you can heal from any wound and glimpse enlightenment. The crinoids are said to have more lessons, but those who seek them out have never returned to the surface to share their wisdom.[u/Mundovore]\n14.  The Demon Prince of Addiction will make a deal with any addict to any vice; in exchange for spreading their addiction to three other mortals of lesser age, it will will free them from their own addiction.[u/Mundovore]\n15.  Chant an ode to the Coldstar until your voice breaks. You will never speak again, but in exchange the Coldstar will shelter you. You will be warmed in the cold, kept cool in the heat, kept dry from the rain and find water in deserts, and will suffer from no diseases or maladies except those brought about by age.[u/Mundovore]\n16. If you light the fire for a kettle you cherish with a whistle and a smile each morning for three-hundred-thirty-three days in a row, it will fill itself and wake you with its whistle as long as you continue to cherish it.[u/Mundovore]\n17. Gather seven raw gemstones each with a different number of facets. The agents of Chaos and Order will both be appeased by your actions, scattering the gems back to the earth sevenfold and bringing you safety in places strange to you until two others conduct the ritual.[u/Mundovore]\n18. The village is protected by a nearby monastic order. The monastics spend three months in a chamber with their throats bound by ribbons, their months inclined upward to the ceiling where they survive on a diet of a honeyed water that the masters of the order prepare. When it is finished, their voices are sealed rendering them incapable of speech except when it would shatter the unrepentant. (For the younger monastics, this shattering is clearly figurative, although this already deters most cruelties to the town. The greater evils are repelled by the reputations of the order's elders, who are said to bring rain when they chastise droughts.)[u/Mundovore]\n19. To Speak with Dead: In the location nearest the decedent's place of death, or thier sanctified place of rest or internment, wear priestly vestments or mourning cloth of white, black, or yellow. At dawn, dig a trench three pace long by two paces wide by three paces deep; decorate thy face with bentonite clay, powdered pumice, and yellow ochre mixed with holy water, and olive oil or the rendered fat of a swan. At mid-day, place three gold pieces in thy mouth and hold them there or swallow them, then blindfold thyself with a blessed stole.  At dusk, burn holy incense, sage, and rosemary, stand to the east of the trench, and turning to the north, take athane and sacrifice a Ram, then turn to the south, and sacrifice a pregnant Ewe, extracting the unborn lamb and uterus and place it within the trench to the west.  Drain the blood of the Ram and Ewe into the trench while speaking the name of that to whom you wish to speak.  Should the spirit be free, and willing, they will hear and answer.  You will not be able to see the spirit, nor will they be able to perceive you until after the sacrifice is performed.  Be warned, every other spirit in the area may also hear and partake of the sacrifice as well.  You may converse with the spirits until midnight, but they need not tell the truth, or answer, and may attempt to deceive you or impersonate others if they wish.  Particularly hostile spirits may even attempt to attack or possess those within rage of the ritual.[u/MaxSizels]\n20. To create Eyes of Undeath.  First, you must make a truly good people witness an unspeakable act conducted by someone truly evil.  Both must then be buried alive in the same grave, with the evil person face down, and the good face up.  On the following midnight they will be exhumed.  The good person will be prayed over for safe passage to paradise in the next life until dawn, then have their right eye removed.  The evil one will be prayed over until dawn for eternal damnation, then have their left eye removed.  The good person will then be tended to in the untomst respect and dignity by the person who will receive their eye; they will redress them in the finest of garments and give them a burial at sea.  The person which is to recieve the evil persons eye will throw them back in the grave, piss on their corpse, and set it on fire.  These should be done at the same time, unless one person is receiving both eyes, in which case the evil person's corpse is dealt with first.  To receive the good eye, pluck out the right eye of the recipient and insert the new eye.  The good person's name will then be branded on the recipients back vertically down their spine.  To receive the evil eye, pluck out the recipient's left eye and insert the new one. A scar will the be made vertically down their face from the middle of the forehead above the new eye to just below the nose under it.",

Arrange the chairs around the room in such a way that no seat faces the front or the back of any other seat. All chairs should be free, comfortable and in good conditions. Squeaks and creaks are historically not appreciated. Be sure to test the chairs in advance and NOT during the ritual. Once the layout is set, select one chair and address it elegantly and convincingly, gesturing with both hands towards it. Speak the following: \"For the guest\". From this point forward, do not touch or move this chair for any reason. With regular steps, proceed to address every chair in the room with the following formula: \"For X\". X stands for the name given to each effigy. After having said its name, place the designated effigy on the chair and repeat. Once left with only one free chair, slowly sit down. You might feel the chair bend under your weight. This is normal, maintain poise. If everything was performed correctly, the Eversat will gracefully demand your attention via sensory cues.

    "body": "The Maah Daah Hey trail (MDHT) runs 145 miles thru the badlands of North Dakota, near the Montana border. The badlands are a really stunning geologic area. If you like hiking in unusual conditions and don't mind the heat and long water carries, this is a really interesting place to hike.\n\nOur plan was to hike from Sully Creek campground to the Bennett campground NOBO. We ended up shortening the trip by about 9 miles due to rain on our last night and the horrible trail conditions which rain and the bentonite clay produce. We did a total distance of around 82 miles.\n\nThe main challenge you'll face on the Maah Daah Hey trail is water, not enough water and sometimes too much water. There are very few spots to get water on trail. We spent a full day caching all of the water that we used for our hike. We were hiking before the water was turned on at the campgrounds. If you go after Memorial Day there will be water at the campgrounds which are spaced about 20 mi apart. Most days we left camp with 4 L of water.\n\nWhen there's rain the Little Missouri River gets high and the bentonite clay becomes a slippery, sticky mess that is really hard to move in.\n\nMay 14. We spent the entire day caching jugs of water at the water boxes and the campgrounds along our route. There had been rain for the previous 3 days and the driving conditions were very slippery and the trail conditions were even worse.\n\nMay 15. We decided to use our one spare day to let the trail dry out. We did touristy things around Medora, North Dakota.\n\nMay 16. Day 1. Animals. 22 mi from Sully Creek State Park to Wannagan campground. We were surveilled very closely by a wild horse stallion who was guarding his harem. We bushwhacked around them. We came up onto the Big Plateau and we ran into a bunch of bison which refused to move (they never move). We had a steep side hill to get around them. An hour later we ran into about 100 bison which of course we had to detour around. Somehow we messed up and got on to the Petrified Forest trail instead of staying on the Maah Daah Hey. In spite of the detour it was really fun pondering the history and the petrified Cyprus stumps.\n\nMay 17. Smoke, rain, mud. More mud. 13 miles. When we got up it seemed to be misty  but eventually we started smelling smoke and it got thicker and thicker. There was a strong wind blowing smoke from fires in Alberta, Canada. As we walked, it eventually started to rain and rained for an hour and a half or two. Not particularly heavy, but that was enough to create the infamous bentonite clay mud of the Maah Daah Hey. Bentonite clay is what it's made of and it is very sticky and very slippery. You get thick clumps on your shoes and anything it touches, making walking a real challenge. Our speed dropped by more than half. You know it's slippery when you intentionally step on bison poop to gain some traction. We were planning to do a 22 mile day but the mud slowed us down so much. We were exhausted and stopped at the Roosevelt water box.\n\nMay 18. 17 miles. Cool (55F/13C) and windy all day. We started at the Roosevelt water box and went down to the flood plain of the Little Missouri.\n\nMay 19. 12 miles. Brilliant sun and hot conditions (82F/28C). First order was to cross the Little Missouri river. When we started our hike the river was too high to ford. We were hoping that a few days later it would drop enough to be safe. It was about mid thigh but the current was not too strong and the bottom was pretty solid gravel. A fairly easy crossing. The real challenge was getting across Whitetail creek which was a complete mud bog, but we were able to find a bunch of fallen tree limbs and logs, placing them in the mud to carefully step our way across. That afternoon we crossed Devil's Pass which was used to move cattle from the plateau to lower grasslands. No way I'd want to cross it if it was wet. We camped at Magpie campground where we had neighbors and water. Yes, the first campground that has the water turned on. Time to rinse some stinky clothes and take a spit bath.\n\nMay 20. 18 miles. Hot conditions (84F/29C) We hiked from Magpie campground to the Beicegel water box to pick up some water, then a couple more miles to camp. The gnats were bothering us so we decided to camp on a windy grassy knoll. The wind worked wonderfully for keeping the bugs off but we had a very fast moving thunderstorm hit us. We had about 20 minutes of extreme anxiety while the storm raged.\n\nMay 21. Our plan was to hike to the Bennett campground and get a shuttle from Dakota Cyclery. When we got up we tested the mud conditions and they were nasty, worse than day two. We had to be back to Sully Creek campground that afternoon to get ready to fly out the following day, so we bailed.\n\nThis trail is in the middle of nowhere and hard to get to, but it's got some amazing sights and it's hugely unusual.\n\n[Pictures:](https://imgur.com/a/CnccBeo)",

I recommend finding a large (better toothpaste to packaging ratio) tube of conventional or prescription fluoride paste and training yourself to use a small amount each time (a little dab will do ya) and use it all up (cut tube open). You shouldn't need to buy more than a tube or two per year.\nXylitol is good stuff too, but studies showed that you have to have a good sized dose 5x a day to see much effect and most people can't commit to that. You also have to ease into xylitol consumption if you are swallowing it (I use it in my tea).\nFloss daily to also help prevent unnecessarily wasteful/expensive/painful  dental visits.\nYou are probably best spending the time to learn how to brush and floss like a pro.

    "body": " [Video](https://youtu.be/pNw77xnCog4)\n\nDeclaration Grooming (https://www.declarationgrooming.com/) announced the retirement of their Icarus soap base in favor of an upgraded soap base known as Milksteak. The goal was to refine the base for an easier lather experience and work to mute some of the animalic scent notes inherent in a base consisting of several animal fats and milks. Declaration Grooming is known for featuring amazing soap, aftershave and cologne offerings as well as highly sought after hand tied badger brushes. This one man band is based out of Ferndale, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)) and The Stray Whisker ([https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/](https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/)). \n\nThis Milksteak is a final version tester and is unscented by design. This base has been designed to minimize the scent imparted by the natural ingredients. Off the tub there is a hint of animalic zest, but as soon as it begins to lather, that scent goes away. This is ideal for use when you desire a shave that will not interfere with your post shave splash or balm and any accompanying fragrance. Mrs. Ruds is a fan of this unscented scent because I am able to wear whatever she enjoys post shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Stirling Soap Co. Unscented as a comparable unscented profile.\n\nDeclaration Grooming Milksteak base aims to improve on the already elite Icarus soap base. Listed ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Yogurt, Buttermilk, Egg Whites, Coconut Milk, Goat's Milk, Tocopheryl Acetate, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract,  Arctium lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Silk Amino Acids. This soap is on the firmer side of mid and is a mindlessly easy loading soap. The soap is thirsty, but not as thirsty as the most thirsty soaps. With water and agitation, the soap base explodes into a creamy, dense lather that has a consistency similar to Greek yogurt. While improvement over Icarus is only slight, the slickness is definitely improved. Primary and residual slickness are elite in performance, probably the slickest lather that I have ever experienced. Post shave is the absolute best I have experienced in a soap base to date. The post shave feeling is pure luxury. Declaration Milksteak soap base is a sheer pleasure to use. Somehow it elevates the shaving experience to a level few have achieved. Given this experience and the improvements, Declaration Grooming Milksteak receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in soap bases I suggest: Barrister and Mann and Talbot Shaving.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming ‚ÄúMilksteak‚Äù Unscented (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Gamechanger .84 (purchased)\n* Post - Folsom & Co.

You quickly dash in and out of the grass and check yourself for ticks. Finding none you head home and fall asleep on the couch, dreaming blissfully of the wonderful day you just had. And then you wake up and find massive welts that itch horribly all across your legs and by scratching it you spread it to other places on your body. Who doesn‚Äôt love poison ivy! \n\n# I'm just gonna say it: fuck you poison ivy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l90h7v7ih3891.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=448d0ef1f9add7fe7ffc14ab7dfdbdf28247f2fc\n\nAlright now I got that off my chest we can jump into today‚Äôs quick topic: allergenic plants! Many of us have heard the common idiom: ‚ÄúLeaves of Three, Let it Be‚Äù because a simple brush against this plant can cause a nasty rash, welts, and even burns. While we tend to think of Poison Ivy as being the only poisonous plant, there are several in the genus *Toxicodendron* that cause damage to the skin. This includes Poison Oak (Western NA: *T. diversilobum* Eastern NA: *T. pubescens*), Poison Sumac (*T. vernix*),the Lacquer Tree (*T. vernicifluum*), and Wax Tree (*T. succedaneum*). The offending agent is **Urushiol Oil**, a leaf surface element that is a mixture of diphenols with varying tails. Today we will explore why Urushiol wreaks havoc on the skin and what remedies are out there!\n\n* While Europeans would discover these plants when they traveled to the New World, the East knew about these plants for millenia. In fact Chinese and Japanese craftsmen would slice open the bark of the Lacquer and Wax trees to harvest the resin inside. They could reine this resin to form a lacquer that would add strength and resilience to woodenware that was far superior to Western pine or balsam varnishes. In 1880, German geographer Johannes Justus Rein studied the lacquer making process and said:\n   * *‚ÄúIt is a peculiar, not very painful, and not at all fatal, but always very disagreeable disease, always attacking one new to the work. . . . It appears in a mild reddening and swelling of the back of the hands, the face, eyelids, ears, the region of the navel and lower parts of the body, especially the scrotum. In all these parts great heat is felt and violent itching and burning, causing many sleepless nights. In two or three days the crisis is reached, and the swelling immediately subsides. In severe cases, small festering boils form also.*‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9nwf8najh3891.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed23bfa2ff7f4585514313fc47cb36945ad3ee46\n\n* While the liquid lacquer is poisonous the dried lacquer was inert allowing artists to inlay pigments, gold, and pearls into it. The process was so popular that Westerners attempted to copy the art with black and gold in a style called Japanning. See if you can guess which one is an original Japanese lacquer versus a 1600s copy. Answer at the bottom of the post!\n* Native Americans were also familiar with the plant and had novel uses for the plant. Various tribes like the Meskwaki, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi would carefully pick the Poison Ivy or Oak leaves and smash it to a poultice to apply to the skin. This would cause the skin to welt and open where other more potent medicines could be applied. Navajos also used the poultice as a poisoned arrow along with deer blood and charcoal. Some tribes would chew the leaves for good luck while gambling or use Poison Oak branches as a spit to roast meat. The Yuki tribe of California was also known to take the sap of Poison Sumac and mix it with hemlock (also poisonous) and suet to make tribal markings. These people are legit metal. \n* Joseph Pitton de Tournefort would establish the original genus for these plants, *Rhus*, in 1700 and later botanists would add the species slowly over the next half century. In an interesting, literal screaming match among botanists these plants were reassigned from *Rhus* to their own genus *Toxicodendron* to separate them from their non-poisonous cousins. Let me describe both sides and you tell me who you agree with in the comments:\n   * Pro-*Toxicodendron* botanists say that since these poisonous plants (specifically Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac) have leaves divided into three ovate leaflets, variously indented, lobed, and downy beneath. In June, they all have greenish-white flowers and bear grayish-white waxy, berry-like fruits. When interacting with skin, they all give the same reaction.\n   * Anti-*Toxicodendron* botanists scream NO! While these species have the ability to cause contact dermatitis due to the Urushiol Oil, that doesn‚Äôt mean they should be split. Splitting them off reduces the description of the *Rhus* family arbitrarily. It does not make sense to take a group of plants and split them off despite having clear similarities to other *Rhus* members. They say there can be *Rhus* poison varieties and *Rhus* non-poison varieties. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Urushiol with possible substitutions](https://preview.redd.it/fd72vbyph3891.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=0984cf00ba3cfc2a3ac369b7e37963562af60668)\n\n* Anyways, let's talk about the poison some more. As we said Urushiol Oil‚Äôs composition can vary based on the type of plant or the place on the plant you brush against. These compounds are called alkyl catechols containing a diphenol head with a long waxy/greasy tail that repels water. It‚Äôs the long lipophilic tail that allows Urushiol to easily pass through the skin. Once the Urushiol enters the skin, it is oxidized by the body rapidly and attaches to proteins in the skin. White blood cells recognize this toxin and activate the immune system to search and destroy the proteins that are connected to the Urushiol. The result: inflammation, itchiness, welts, and blisters. \n   * Urushiol isn‚Äôt just unique to *Toxicodendron*, it's surprisingly common among many plants. Other plants in the same family like Mango, Pistachio, and the Cashew Shell contain Urushiol which may account for why you can get a lip blister from eating too many mangoes (pistachios and cashews are roasted). Unrelated to these plants is *Ginkgo biloba*, a common Chinese herbal supplement. \n   * Last thing before we dive into drugs and methods to reduce poison ivy rashes. Let‚Äôs go through some myths of Poison Ivy (and its siblings)!\n      * **Scratching poison ivy blisters will spread the rash**. False. The rash is caused by the Urushiol Oil that *penetrates* the skin. By the time you start to see the blisters forming and want to scratch it, the oil has already been absorbed into the skin. That being said, if you have the oil still on the skin (pre-rash) and scratch a different part of the body you will spread the oil. This is how you can get it on your face or sensitive areas. Also, try to avoid scratching as it just lets infection get in and complicate matters. \n      * **Poison Ivy can be spread through the blisters**. False. Again the oils have already penetrated the skin and are gone by the time you know you touched the plant. Rubbing your oozing blister on a younger sibling won‚Äôt spread it but is pretty gnarly. Now stop fighting in the backseat.\n      * **Dead poison ivy plants are not toxic**. False! Even dead plants still have the waxy coating on their leaves which can be transferred onto clothes or skin. \n      * **You can only get poison ivy from direct contact with the plant.** False. Urushiol can survive on clothes and surfaces for months to years! Yup, wash your clothes once you‚Äôve been out where you think poison ivy may be. LIkewise pet fur can pick up the oil and transfer it to your skin, so be careful when you let the dog off the leash. \n      * **You can build immunity to poison ivy or already be immune.** True, kind of! About 10-15% of the population is able to tolerate Urushiol Oil. I am one of those people, my family not so much. However, you cannot build immunity by exposing yourself to the plant repeatedly because the chemical itself is not noxious. Its our immune system that freaks out so you‚Äôd have to be born without that antigen receptor. \n\n# Okay I touched it. Now what?\n\nGenerally the rash appears 12 to 48 hours after exposure so what you can do varies based on when you noticed you came in contact with the plant. I will be describing the products you can find over-the-counter in the US and some other tips that work best for most people!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bentonite clay vs Quaternium-18](https://preview.redd.it/52ar7gcrh3891.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9311ab7dc178e31888d5fbae5c04638f2dd5723)\n\n* **I have yet to touch the plant but I was close to it**. You're fine. Don‚Äôt touch it. Although you can use a physical barrier like **Bentoquatam** to stop Urushiol from sticking to the skin when you brush against it and prevents absorption into the skin. Bentoquatam does nothing for the immune reaction, so applying it *after* the reaction has started does nothing. Bentoquantam is a topical agent (lotion or cream) that is a combination of **Bentonite** (natural hydrated colloidal aluminum silicate clay) and Quaternium-18. If you are an avid hiker and allergic to poison ivy, getting this to prevent the rash is a must have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpcvo0ath3891.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c0d1fe3031ea4b84ebb2d65f6e5f0f1bcb2ecc\n\n* **I just got Urushiol Oil on my skin/clothes by brushing up against the plant.** There is some evidence that soap and water will remove the Urushiol oil from the skin if done within 30min but it also has the potential for washing it to other areas of the body (especially if you shower, just wash thoroughly top to bottom). Other surfactants like **Ethoxylate/Sodium Laural Sarcosinate** are able to quickly pick up the oil from the skin and contain it in droplets as you wash the product off your skin. If applied between 2 to 8 hours, the chance of preventing a rash is about 80%! \n   * There are a bunch of different products that contain the mixture of Ethoxylate/Sodium Laural Sarcosinate but the one I have seen work is **Tecnu**. Originally developed in by Dr. Robert Smith 1962 as a way to remove radioactive fallout. Smith‚Äôs wife noticed that she didn‚Äôt develop a rash when she used the product after touching a Poison Oak tree and in 1977 Tecnu was marketed to foresters and firefighters as a Poison Ivy preventative. Another option is **GOOP** although it's not sold near where I am. \n* **The rash is forming but it hasn‚Äôt started to itch yet**. Well looks like ya got poison ivy champ :/ At this point, no amount of washing your skin will prevent the rash from continuing (although you should wash the clothes you were wearing, including shoes) but there are drugs available to slow it down and reduce symptoms. \n   * **Topical steroids** are your friends in this case. Remember that the rash is not due to the chemical but due to the immune system. Topical steroids like hydrocortisone cream inhibit the immune system locally thus decreasing its effects. By using steroids round the clock for the next 24 hours, you can stop the progression of the rash or decrease the symptoms you have. Remember to read the instructions on the label and check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns. \n* **Oh God, the itching is terrible and I can‚Äôt stand it**. For those of you who are very sensitive to the oil and itch a ton, there are a few different options that can be done together to limit the itchiness and relieve symptoms. \n   * Another option is **Oral Antihistamines** like sedating **Diphenhydramine** (Benadryl) or **Dimenhydrinate** (Dramamine) or non-sedating options like **Cetirizine** (Zyrtec), **Loratadine** (Claritin) or **Fexofenadine** (Allegra). This drugs work by preventing the binding of histamine to nociceptors (touch sensors) in the skin. \n      * Now, this is something that I think most medical professionals may not know: **when you have an allergic skin reaction, use an H1 blocker with a H2 blocker.** In the skin we have two histamine receptors, H1 (85%) and H2 (15%). By only using H1 antagonists like the drugs listed above, you only block 85% of the itchiness so adding a H2 antagonist helps block the remaining itch factor. You can find **Famotidine** (Pepcid) over the counter. Remember to read the instructions on the label and check with your doctor or pharmacist if you have concerns. ‚Äò\n   * Other options for itchiness relief are **Astringents** which dry out the skin and reduce weeping and itchiness. These are your lotions and creams like **Calamine**, **Zinc Oxide,** or **Aluminum Acetate** (Burow's Solution)**.** Another is using an **Antipruritic** like **Colloidal Oatmeal** (Aveeno) to block itchiness. Do not use astringents (which dry out the skin) with something that will hydrate the skin (like aloe). \n   * Finally, avoid topical anesthetics like **Lidocaine, Phenol, or Pramoxine**. While they provide relief in the short term, the amount of product you‚Äôd have to apply to get complete symptom relief is pretty dangerous. Likewise the highly inflamed area increases the systemic effects of these products which can cause unwanted side effects. \n\n# ‚ÄúAn old fox hunter living in the neighborhood came to see me‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nNow that you are experts on preventing and treating poison ivy, we can now look at previous treatments of poison ivy and see how spot on they were. The following are some excerpts from 1800s treatment books I found and‚Ä¶ well they‚Äôre clever to say the least. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2hznh3vh3891.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=09a14ae05edc1ab317dd66ed9e22830858f3a822\n\n* Our first remedy from a Mr. James Wersick from New Jersey described his remedy for curing poison ivy. His use of olive oil or glycerine is like using soap to wash off the Urushiol. Instead of removing it with a surfactant, he is dissolving the oil in oil and then washing it off afterwards. Clever! Using 15 grains of Bromine however is‚Ä¶ accurate although contemporary practices were wonky. Bromine, often formulated as potassium bromide, is an antiseptic that is still used to this day to kill bacteria on the surface of the skin. Today however the concentration is controlled but back then it could be a low concentration causing muscle relaxation or anti-itching, or could be potent causing convulsions, coma, or death. Yikes!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30zvz50wh3891.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3499eb0c6e09a88a53a9de0dac2c13366a7ad7f\n\n* In this case the magical solution uses two completely not dangerous in any way (pinky promise) ingredients: cyanide and lead! While i'm unsure how the lead would help with the itching, the hydrocyanic acid would effectively kill the neurons and skin where applied. The alcohol isn‚Äôt a bad touch though since it is an astringent, something we learned is helpful with poison ivy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9j54rjxh3891.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c1c305685339d1d199867a37fcb6c218e154a3b\n\n* New remedy: find an old fox hunter. (By the way, poison oak has leaves of 5 soooo‚Ä¶)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzazwayyh3891.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=53ffe83e67b8a899bd0bfbc3338ed82aab951692\n\n* Again not a bad remedy. We learned that bentonite clay is useful in occluding the skin and creating a barrier. While I am skeptical of its use in rheumatism (like arthritis) or dropsy (edema or fluid accumulation in the legs), it would be a good *preventative* for poison ivy. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dykywv90i3891.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=d36ceed64a9e1b9c5bd32d4a8b3eec937260f7c3\n\n* Okay this one has nothing to do with poison ivy but I couldn‚Äôt not put it in. \n\n**And that‚Äôs our story!** Hopefully this provides some insight into a less known drug class and you learned something new.

    "body": "I've been meaning to write this one up for a while but never got around to it. This is a method I guess I developed for shell casting without the use of ceramic slurries. Haven't seen anyone else silly enough to make a cement based mold let alone one that doesn't explode, but happy to be proven wrong if it was already done before. Until then I will name this as the cement shell method.\n\nThe attached pictures are referenced below by their number and a colon.\n\nThis process is a build on the more popular joint compound method for 3D prints, and it all starts with sodium silicate. I made a tonne of the stuff using crystal cat litter, sodium hydroxide and water in a steel mixing bowl on heat. It's a very useful material and extremely cheap when made this way. I store mine in a 4L HDPE container. It is compatible with PLA objects, but it's very thick and will cause chemical burns. It gels up like napalm, very hard to scrub off if let to sit for long enough. This method uses highly concentrated sodium silicate to minimise water content, so please be aware of this.\n\n1: 3D printed patterns were first coated with a modest layer of joint compound. Not too thin as the purpose is to shield the pattern in later steps, but not too thick as it will crumble while curing. Paper straws were used to create sprues at various points both at the top and bottom of the pattern so that there's a kind of air flow from the bottom to the top. \n\nCare should be taken during design of these patterns as not everything will work here. There *must* be generous airflow throughout as much of the part as possible. Patterns with overall cylindrical or conical shapes that have intricacies which can be packed in but without large overhangs appear best suited. Smooth parts do not work well with this method due to poor adhesion.\n\n2: A special mix is applied to the part with gloved hands one side at a time, and then left to dry in the sun. The recipe I came up with was 1 part grey cement, 1 part sodium silicate, a half part of river sand, a very small amount of water and at least two parts of bentonite clay. Water and bentonite clay may be added or subtracted to change the consistency of the mix. I highly encourage experimentation to see what works for you.\n\nMy mix was applied on quite thick, however this will obviously hold a different composition throughout different parts of the cure due to cement's gradual water absorption. All I can say is that there is a happy midpoint between too dry and too wet. Even after curing it seems beneficial to have a little bit of moisture holding the mold together as the joint compound is the only surface actually contacting the hot metal.\n\n3: Three different methods of creating the shell. On the left is plaster plus sodium silicate. The CSH crystals created actively compromise the mold strength and the crystals almost behave like asbestos, definitely not recommended. On the right is a cement only approach, and in the center is a mix of both cement and plaster. I also tried a sodium silicate and sand mix, but it was far too coarse, it crushed my pattern and was difficult to cure. Only the pattern on the right was successfully cured.\n\n4-5: Failure of the molds due to poor adhesion, abrasion and crumbling away during heating where it wasn't thick enough. Large overhangs on the pattern weren't great either. Maybe a super chunky block would've had better results but the mix tends to shrink and crack at those sizes.\n\n6-8: Depicted is the burnout process which I started a few days after the previous step. I stood the mold on sheet metal held up with some cinder blocks. Underneath was a bunsen burner running LPG. The mold initially released a lot of steam, and then the plastic began to burn out from inside. The highly porous structure created from the sodium silicate interrupting cement's normal curing process is what I believe allows this to get hot without spelling. Flames first appeared at the bottom of the mold, not the top, however some smoke was observed from the vents. The mold was then flipped over and fire is observed emerging from inside the mold. It seems like burning the mold out from the inside is the goal during this process. The gas was on for about 90 minutes in total.\n\n9: Once the burnout was complete, I used some air drying clay to gently plug the vent holes. It was not a great method due to poor adhesion, but it did ultimately work out.\n\n10-12: The metal used for this cast was a zinc aluminum alloy. The mold was buried in sand, and a sheet metal ring (with painters tape) was used as a catch in case of overflow. The pour did give off a little steam, but it escaped readily through the outside of the structure instead of bubbling through the metal. Please observe the thickness of the mold which did hold up, and where it did not.\n\n13-14: The partially washed out mold following the cast and a cross section of the shell. The joint compound takes the heat while retaining details, and the cement keeps the joint compound from falling apart.\n\n15-16: The cement shell method was compared against a two-part traditional plaster cast and oven burnout. Unfortunately as we see very often in practice with plaster, it retained too much moisture despite extensive heating. The water had nowhere else to escape other than directly through the metal, and so it bubbled up profusely during the pour. The finished structure displays a failure to fill the bottom of the mold, but a large amount of metal still caught in the sprue. The two part mold also shifted its position due to the violent reaction, spilling out from the side and ruining the part. The cement shell method could not replicate this specific pattern either, so I admit this isn't a fair comparison and more testing is required.\n\n16-20: The successful casting with vents removed, and some light filing/polishing. There are some imperfections like pitting, but also a lot of detail. Layer lines are mostly preserved, as are facial features and other complex structures. The woman's left arm and the man's left foot did not fill properly, and I suspect that this is due to the fragile parts collapsing inwards during the curing process. I believe the pitting is due to sand and other hard granular structures from the cement shell pressing into the pattern and slightly disrupting its shape during curing. It is however a large improvement over previous attempts with just the joint compound, as excess plastic melted and hardened up at the bottom of the mold, preventing the metal from filling any further. At least you don't have to deal with any fine soot embedded in the finished casting, and no bubbles indicating porosity were observed after cutting off the sprue, which is nice.\n\nThe cement shell method is not a replacement for many other tried and proven methods of casting. It is however an option worth considering for parts with geometries that suit it. This method is extremely accessible, cheap and easy to scale up. It can achieve a thorough burnout in relatively minimal time and withstand high temperatures easily. It takes very well to parts with intricate textures that it can be packed tightly into. The cured mold does maintain its properties even after long periods of storage. However it is fragile, easily abraded away, and cannot easily replicate smooth surfaces or large sharp overhangs. This method was not developed with a strictly scientific approach so improvements are certainly needed.\n\nThanks for reading. I hope this method can be of use to you and any discussion or critique is welcomed.",

    "body": "I've been sick for over 6 years. There's **a lot** to talk about and I won't go into detail here, I'm only sharing the most important parts to help out those of you who are suffering since I've been experiencing a lot of seemingly definitive recovery. I'll make a post and probably a video in the future to share all my research and way more details, but in the meantime feel free to ask me anything you want in the comments.\n\nI'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, I'm sharing this post for informational purposes only.\n\n# My SIBO-related issues:\n\n* Hydrogen, this is what I developed first. Now fully cured.\n* Hydrogen sulfide, developed about 1.5 years into the disease. Now fully cured.\n* Bile acid diarrhea / bile acid malabsorption, developed 3.5 years into the disease. Now seriously improved.\n* Methane, developed 4 years into the disease. Now noticeably improved.\n\nI'm still pursuing treatment & seeing improvements.\n\n# The root cause for my SIBO:\n\nVery likely abdominal adhesions. That's when bands of fibrous collagen develop between the fascia of your organs and muscles, preventing proper intestinal muscle contractions, leading to pockets to mucus buildup in which any bad bacteria passing by can settle home and develop. I can't be 100% certain that I indeed have adhesions because there's no other foolproof diagnosis than surgery but I am 90+% certain that this is it as I have many obvious reasons and signs that I'll elaborate on in my next post. For some people, imaging tests can reveal an obstructed or deformed digestive tract, which may suggest adhesions.\n\nSlowed motility and lack of intestinal contractions, even when you have diarrhea, is typically the reason people develop SIBO. People with normal peristalsis can eat all sorts of crap and be much less likely to keep bad bacteria hanging around because their small intestine constantly pushes them out. This post addresses that in some ways, so you might still benefit from it even if you don't have adhesions.\n\nKnowing the root cause for your issues is important because it'll determine how likely the treatments that worked for are to work for you, and whether you'll experience relapse.\n\nI think adhesions are massively underdiagnosed and a huge proportion of people suffer from them unknowingly. Unlike what's commonly believed they can develop in plenty of cases where very high inflammation is present, like after a food poisoning episode, or with endometriosis, PCOS, chron's disease... and obviously after bowel surgery. For me, it was after an insane binge eating episode that left me feeling like my organs were tearing apart, I was rushed to the ER but ended up not being operated on.\n\n# What worked for me:\n\n* **Huge amounts of NAC powder**: This is what cured my hydrogen SIBO and considerably decreased my bile acid diarrhea and methane symptoms. But be aware of side effects, I didn't believe die-off was a thing for me until I consumed this supplement. Sulfur gas (smells like rotten eggs / chicken), gut pain (often feeling like adhesions breaking), joint pain, nausea, depression, and diarrhea are normal side effects when the bad bacteria dies and gets released in your gut, but take the same dose of NAC a few times and you'll notice the side effects going away a little more each time as your body adapts & heals. The powder form works while the tablet one (buffered) seems not to. You should encapsulate it in HPMC capsules (you can buy a size 000 capsule filler to make the process faster) and take it throughout meals to prevent teeth erosion and heartburn. The trick to swallowing lots of pills is to do it with something thick, like a smoothie. I started with 0.5g before each 100g of food, I'm currently taking 7g (7x capsules size 000) before each 100g of food typically every other day and I'm still seeing improvements. I suspect that it's breaking adhesions and mucus, I'll elaborate more in my next post.\n* **Pyridostigmine**: This is what decreased both my chronic diarrhea and methane the most, likely because it's a prokinetic that works on the whole digestive tract and because it increases vagal tone. Regarding the short term it worked even better than horse chestnut at limitting methane. It also broke small adhesions, slowly, day by day, despite loperamide decreasing peristalsis while I was taking it - it does work better without antidiarrheals though. I eventually reached a point where taking antidiarrheals was giving me too much methane (& subsequent headache) due to a lack of diarrhea, but I just had to decrease the amount I took each time I had a serious headache, until I stopped using antidiarrheals. As my gut improved so did my cognition and some chronic injuries I've had for years, it might only be thanks to the gut healing, but pyridostigmine has also been shown to improve tendon healing and cognition regardless of gut issues. I typically take 120mg on an empty stomach twice a day. At higher doses or frequencies I get side effects: my heart races for a few minutes + I feel unwell and need to lay down. Typically I try to take it before and after sleep, or at least space each dose out by 12h, but I've noticed I don't feel really good if I take it in the afternoon for my second dose rather than at night. Developing tolerance is rare, but if you notice that it's losing potency then it's advised to take a break for 2-7 days. I've heard that it can bring even stronger prokinetic effects when combined with prucalopride but I didn't feel a difference when I tried it (2mg).\n* **High intensity radial shockwave therapy** (up to 0.55 mJ/mm¬≤): This is what cured me of the hydrogen sulfide gas that I used to have after eating, and it decreased my methane baseline. I used an EMS Dolorclast Master with a Power+ handpiece directly on my abdomen and looked for areas that felt glued, I could only really figure out where they were with this machine, and sometimes massages, as no imaging method could detect them. The improvements eventually plateau'd after a year of use and only NAC powder pushed them further.\n* **Ibuprofen**: This can be a seriously risky medication so I think you should be supervised by a medical doctor, ideally a nephrologist if you're going to use it. That's because it can worsen ulcers if you have any, and potentially cause serious kidney damage if you're too dehydrated (as is the case for many of us with diarrhea). That being said though it worked fantastically well for me. By decreasing mucus and signaling to adhesions to remodel, it broke massive adhesions in abdomen and led me to be 100% lactose tolerant! Not a single gas or extra diarrhea from dairy anymore. If you're going to try it, prior to each dose you need to do a blood test (basic metabolic panel + eGFR) and a urine test (albumine/creatinine ratio) and only proceed if they're normal (still at your own risks), then do them again 2-3 days later to check whether your kidneys are tolerating the medication well. If they don't, you should get on an aggressive rehydration protocol (go to the ER for IV if needed), as well as different kidney preserving strategies to see with your doctor (kidney adapted diet, amlodipine if systolic blood pressure >130, if you're never dehydrated ACE-i/ARB and potentially SGLT2-i, and optionally subQ BPC-157 + TB-500 to prevent fibrosis) and avoiding any NSAID or medication affecting the kidneys for at least a month.\n* **Bisacodyl**: It's a strong stimulant laxative. It broke adhesions in my colon and improved my diarrhea. It felt very similar to NAC but didn't affect the small intestine nor gave me sulfur gas. I noticed that using it 2-3 times in row, 8-12 hours apart between doses, gave the strongest adhesion breaking effects, likely due to the later doses acting on an emptier tract. But then I'd have to take at least a 4 days break between each session not to develop tolerance. The doses varied from 10-30mg. Eventually I developed some ulcer symptoms (lower stomach pain + sulfur burps) after a bisacodyl session, which is one more sign that I had adhesions between my colon and stomach; I made it go away by drinking some freshly juiced cabbage anytime symptoms showed up, which took 2-3 days. The ulcer never really came back after I felt that big adhesion break.\n* **Racecadotril**: It's an antidiarrheal that doesn't decrease gastrointestinal contractions when used at normal doses, it treats symptoms, it's not a cure. The first time I only used it for a week and it relieved my diarrhea fully, which lasted for a month, during which I ended up developing methane. This was due to my transit being too slow without diarrhea due to adhesions, so any antidiarrheal would've caused that side effect in my case. Be careful if you suspect being in the same case too - it's not worth it. The second time I used it, 2 years later, it actually increased my contractions (frequent gurgling) and decreased methane slightly since my diarrhea was already less strong, which led to the intestines having to do more efforts to kick move food along, kicking out bacteria more effectively. Increasing the dose didn't seem to help but frequency was key. In the process, it made some problematic areas clearer and easier to reach for radial shockwave therapy.\n* **Loperamide**: Works similarly to racecadotril, actually a bit better has the downside of slightly slowing down peristalsis. It also works via a different pathway so both drugs can be alternated, which is what I do: I take loperamide 2mg then 4h later I take racecadotril 100mg, then 4h later loperamide again, etc. It's not great when you're trying to use laxatives to make your intestines break adhesions, but non-laxative prokinetics still seem to work, although I suspect their efficacy must be reduced.\n* **Cholestyramine**: Relieved about 80% of my bile acid diarrhea symptoms for as long as I kept taking it but didn't cure it, and worsened methane a bit since it slowed my transit down a little.\n* **Bismuth subnitrate**: Only a symptom reliever, not a cure, but it's the only OTC supplement that fully stopped all types of diarrhea while I was on it, likely thanks to its strong astringent effects on the gut. I received the best effects by mostly spreading it throughout the meal. There are typically reversible brain damage side effects that are associated to consuming bismuth though so be careful, although bismuth subsalicylate (which didn't work for me) is recommended to be limited at 2g /day and bismuth subnitrate seems to be even less aborbed into the bloodstream so it seems safer. Priority One's Biofilm Phase-2 Advanced‚Ñ¢ is a supplement that contains it but it's pretty expensive. Other than that you can get it directly from certain labs for much cheaper but it's typically more complicated and not legal everywhere.\n* **95+% Montmorillonite (typically through food grade bentonite clay)**: This stopped my diarrhea but only slightly affected the diarrhea related issues (e.g. chronic dehydration, fatigue, and muscle twitches), meaning that it likely only solidifies the poop towards the end of the colon and keeps it in a diarrheal state for most of the transit. After a few months on it I started developing memory issues and a certain type of brain fog, likely because it reduces the absorption of certain nutrients, but overall it helped me tremendously when I didn't have cholestyramine or bismuth subnitrate yet, and it didn't always worsen my methane symptoms (tends to happen when transit is slowed down by antidiarrheals) depending on the severity of my diarrhea and the dosage.\n* **Horse chestnut**: Decreased methane when taken at the start of a meal, but I suspect that it's only due to how it speeds up transit by causing mild intestinal irritation and potentially a bit of diarrhea. Be aware that it contains fiber so it could be problematic if you react to that. I try to never take over 10g per meal as it can have very serious side effects (I once kept passing out with cold sweats, feeling like I was dying, in the night after consuming 25g). Regardless, this has been a life savior on many occasions. You can buy horse chestnut as powder, which is cheap, or find it in Atrantil but that's expensive and contains quebracho colorado, which is a compound that gives me nausea and doesn't help me.\n* **Mo-zyme forte**: Decreased the hydrogen sulfide gas symptoms I was experiencing after eating protein containing food, until radial shockwave therapy actually fixed the issue permanently.\n* **Rifaximin**: Another symptom reliever but not a cure for me. Greatly decreased hydrogen gas associated stress & removed the smell out of my gas, but didn't help the other side effects of hydrogen such as joint pain, absent mindedness, scalp itching, or acne.\n* **Alcohol**: It helps relief symptoms of all kinds of SIBO when consumed throughout a meal by speeding up intestinal digestion and acting as a slight mucolytic (breaks down mucus) in the parts of the digestive system near the stomach. When taken after shockwave therapy, it helped break a bit more adhesions, but I'd say it wasn't as effective as lactose.\n* **Lactose (if intolerant), sucralose, sugar-alcohols, & gelatin**: If taken after shockwave therapy, they helped break some more adhesions. Lactose was more effective than alcohol, which was more effective than gelatin. It's hard to judge how effective sucralose or sugar alcohols were since they were typically in products containing lactose.\n* **Blond psyllium husk**: When taken throughout meals, works almost as well as cholestyramine against bile acid diarrhea, but it also helps other symptoms by increasing transit speed. I could only take it once my fiber digestion was healed by NAC.\n* **Pure pineapple juice**: It worked litterally only once when taken during a meal where I had a bunch of NAC, I felt it cause strong contractions and break a bunch of adhesions. Never worked again after that.\n* **Freshly juiced cabbage**: Resolved extremely quickly the cases of stomach ulcer I had throughout the years. The ulcer symptoms were sulfur burps (smells like rotten eggs), pain, stomach bloating, and sometimes diarrhea. But after seeing how NAC, bisacodyl, and shockwave therapy all greatly helped me by actually first causing pain, I'm wondering if the cabbage juice didn't actually prevent the body from doing its job by masking the signals that the body should try to heal.\n\n# What didn't work for me:\n\nThe tinctures below actually did work. It's just that they didn't offer anything that other simpler and cheaper forms of alcohol, such as vodka, did.\n\nAntibiotics (other than rifaximin) gave me some relief for as long as I was taking them but it was likely only due to the constant diarrhea they caused, flushing out toxins & bacteria.\n\nAll the probiotics temporarily worsened my methane symptoms when taken, except for Florastor and Culturelle, which didn't do anything for me.\n\n* Consuming good amounts of all essential nutrients through my diet\n* Atrantil: It actually worked but the quebracho Colorado in it gave me nausea and didn't help, and horse chestnut (one of the ingredients) powder was cheaper.\n* Massages & vagal nerve stimulation (including using a massage gun)\n* Gallbladder / liver cleanse by Andreas Moritz\n* An enema\n* Probiotic: Florastor (s. boulardii)\n* Probiotic: S.

Anything and everything was a trigger and I would erupt in massive rotten egg burps that DO NOT go away. Causes lots of regurgitating and teeth decay. I heard about NAC, but from reading it says it's sulphurous so I thought it would make my sulphur issues worse... are you saying it made it worse but ultimately fixed that part?\n\nMy gi map was positive for Desulfovibrio piger, which my doctor now uses as a test to test for hydrogen sulphur SIBO. I'm the first case and we're learning together. I've done a few breathe tests that were borderline, the detection of Desulfovibrio piger is what my doctor now tests for in new patients who blow negative regular breathe tests. In Australia, we can't get bismuth! So we're basically going to throw some more amoxicillin at it. We're not sure what else to do. \n\nI was fully cured at one point. I got sick and didn't eat for 3 weeks, it starved off the bacteria and allowed lots of healing. I was in the clear for 6 months. Put on ALL the weight I lost and was getting back to life. I decided to add some \"good bacteria\" as it had been 6 months... worse mistake of my life. I completely relapsed by the end of day and I can't seem to kick the sulphur issues!\n\nAny insight would be appreciated!",

        "body": "I received a DM of someone asking how I knew what I had was adhesions. Here's the explanation for anyone wondering.\n\nI explained how the thought of adhesions came to me in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jop1u2/comment/mkyfy2r/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\nAnd here are the other reasons for why I think I likely have adhesions:\n\n* The symptoms developed only maybe 4 months after a night during which I had severe sharp digestive pain and felt like my organs were tearing apart. These four months are the time it takes for adhesions to develop after an injury.\n* When the symptoms first started, the first thing I felt was that there was tension on my intestines, a bit like when I squeeze my finger too tightly with a rubber band, and I could feel the blood pulsing through the tense parts. This correlates with adhesions constricting intestines, especially when they have to be flexible to let gas through.\n* Since the food accident that eventually started my SIBO, I've always had a recurring  ulcer-like stomach pain which I used to calm down with freshly shredded cabbage juice and go on my way. It happened over the span of certain periods until I'd use cabbage juice but also would typically start again every time that I ate something with a slightly rough texture or that made my stomach contract kinda hard, which I now understand means it was pulling on adhesions. At the time I thought it was completely unrelated to SIBO until I started wondering about having adhesions.\n* In early 2022, I received breath test results showing excess methane, which is the one SIBO gas that seems to resolve every time with increased motility. This meant I had chronically slow transit, which adhesions could explain as they prevent the digestive system to properly contract.\n* The meds that sped up transit helped. Shockwave therapy, which can break adhesions apart, helped. And NAC powder, which breaks disulfide bonds and hence fibrin (a form of adhesion), and promotes stronger contractions due to gut irritation, also helped.\n* When you apply shockwaves to an area where an adhesion attaches to fascia it's clear as day: you can literally feel the areas unglue, and it hurts like if you were to take strong tape off you skin, which also happens with NAC powder. It also sometimes feels like scar tissue breaking apart but that's a slightly different sensation.\n* Multiple times while applying shockwaves or after doing a big stretch after a shockwave therapy & abdominal massage session, I felt part of my intestine detach, either from another intestinal part, another organ, or from the abdominal wall, and suddenly fall off.\n* I've had blood in my stool, which could be an indication of adhesions pulling too much on the intestines when they contract.\n* My methane developed after taking Racecadotril, which paralyzed my intestines to prevent diarrhea, which likely gave the adhesions an opportunity to grow. Adhesions grow along the line of inflammation (which is all of my intestines when I have SIBO) and do so much more easily if there's no movement of the fascia since movement and contractions would constantly break early / weak adhesions.\n* I used to often have soreness in the abdominal muscles that are close to where I felt the most digestive symptoms, so I suspect there were adhesions attaching the intestines to the abdominal wall, pushing the muscles to contract to compensate being pulled on.\n* I always had pain when I pressed on certain areas before the shockwaves and NAC powder, and the same when I vacuumed / sucked in my stomach.\n* Shortly after fragilizing adhesions, mostly with NAC powder and shockwave therapy, during digestion I'd get pains in the muscles surrounding the digestive system, surely due to my digestive system working, pulling on adhesions which then pull on the extrnal muscles they're attached to as well.\n\nThat being said, imaging tests never detected anything on me. This is normal since they can't see adhesions, but it also means that if I indeed had adhesions they weren't bending my digestive tract but rather just freezing it.\n\nNow I still don't have ultimate proof that my SIBO was due to adhesions. There's a lot that we still don't understand about this disease, and maybe the accumulation of mucus acted in a similar way to adhesions? Who knows. I think the best you can do if you find yourself in a similar situation is to try the non invasive treatments first, because getting an adhesiolysis surgery, even simply as diagnosis, can potentially cause more adhesions to form in the longer run.\n\nIf you do end up having adhesiolysis surgery, I encourage you to pick a surgeon who performs it laparoscopically and uses an adhesion barrier that is proven to leave near 0 adhesion, such as 4DryField PH.",

    "body": "[Tobacco Throwdown Round 4- Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian](http://imgur.com/gallery/eQ2LnN3)\n\n\n* **Prep:** Hot Shower \n\n* **Brush:** Lancaster Brushworks\n\n\n* **Razor:** Charcoal Tech\n\n\n* **Blade:** Gillette Silver Blue\n\n\n* **Lather:**  Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian\n\n\n* **Post:** Valedictorian\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started putting out feelers for scents to try a few weeks before I started this series. I recieved a ton of suggestions, but one scent came up a lot more frequently than the others. Summer Break Soaps Valedictorian. I had 7 or 8 different users tell me I had to it. So I immediately ordered a set!\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer Break Soaps is a small artisan operation run part time by two teachers April and Kyle.  Kyle teaches special education which I find extra inspiring as I grew up with a special ed teacher in my house and I know how demanding and challenging that job can be. Like any kind of teaching job though, special ed can also be deeply rewarding.\nApril and Kyle started soapmaking as a fun way to share a hobby and their pass time has grown into a successful and fulfilling business. Summer Break has a line of soaps, splashes, and now Edts (for Valedictorian), and I think I have seen some nice SBS brushes around the sub as well.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer Break has nice tubs for their soaps similar to what Declartion Grooming and Ariana and Evans use. Their aftershave bottles are the mlst common type as used by Noble Otter and Barrister and Mann (when they have splashes), which work quite well.The art work for [Valedictorian](http://imgur.com/gallery/KuSoEj5) is a very serious and scholarly looking owl which gives me some warm and fuzzy Harry Potter vibes both thematically and stylistically. I like this artwork a lot.. The scent notes for Valedictorian are listed as: tobacco, vanilla, vetiver, ginger, orange zest, smoke, rosewood, mahogany, black pepper, and water lily. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my nose the tobacco note stands out foremost with everything else blending together into a smooth and creamy backdrop. The bergamot orange note adds a definite citrus character to the balance. The aftershave splash brings a bit more of the character  of vetiver and rose with a touch of smoke adding some definition, but it is still a smooth, creamy, tobacco forward scent. Valedictorian is unique in that it leaves out the sharper spice notes that many tobacco scents like to include and I think that plays a big part in its popularity, it is significantly more approachable than most funkier tobacco scents. The  splash sticks around all day and is very well received in my house. There is an EdP available for Valedictorian as well but I was not able to score a bottle for this review.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer Break's new base is listed as containing: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Glycerin, Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Liquid, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Grapeseed Oil, Coconut Oil, Sunflower Oil, Kokum Butter, Yogurt Powder, Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance/Essential Oil, Lanolin, Jojoba Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, and Bentonite Clay.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their new base performs quite well, lathering easily into a dense cream even with the hard water in my area. Slickness is good with great cushion. Residual slickness and post shave feel are solid but not elite, but there are no weaknesses or downsides to this lather at all. It is very solid all around performer with a permissive water tolerance and is very quick and easy to whip up.\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranking scents and soaps is always the toughest part of these reviews  for me. I like these products, or I wouldn't own most of them ( this review series was just a thinly-veiled excuse for me to buy more soap after all) and I have trouble finding ways to pick at things I like.  One of the things I like most about tobacco scents is the dirty funky spicy almost grungy notes some of them can dip into. PdP63 that I reviewed last time is a rich sweet scent but still has a bit of tobacco funk at its heart. Valedictorian is a complete departure, occupying a more sophisticated suave and clean space in the tobacco spectrum. I mentioned earlier that I think this accounts for its popularity, but I also think it makes it hard to compare to more conventional tobacco scents. I personally miss some of the funkiness this soap leaves out but at the same time I *like* it for its clean uniqueness. \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall I would rate Valedictorian as in third place right now, just beating out Pre de Provence No. 63 a great scent but Valedictorian wins out for smoothness and sophistication.  It falls a little short of Cognac and Cuban Cigars  and Havana Vieja which bring  a little more dry funk to the table which suits my personal tastes just a  bit more. Still Valedictorian is a great scent and I recommend you check it out if you are intersted in a warm and clean tobacco scent. Summer Breaks soap base (I swear I heard a proper name for it once but cannot remember it now and didn't see it on their site) is a great performer and I look forward to trying more soaps from them in the future.\n\nAs of round 4 the standings for the Tobacco Throwdown stand thusly:\n\n* [#1. Henri et Victoria Cognac and Cuban Cigars](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lvwwij/tobacco_throwdown_day_1_henri_et_victoria_cognac/)\n\n* [#2. Highland Springs Soap Company Havan Vieja](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/lyb2k8/tobacco_throwdown_round_2_highland_springs_soap/)\n\n* [#3.

Pre  de Provence No. 63](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/m1786o/the_tobacco_throwdown_round_3_pre_de_provence_no/)\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for reading the Tobacco Throwdown Round 4, and for following along my review series. As always if you have have any thoughts please comment and let me know. I hope you enjoyed this installment and Ill be back early next week with Round 5!\n\n*I purchased all products in this review myself and was not incentivize by Summer Break Soaps or anyone else to review these products.*",

    "body": "Hey! I'm new to this group and I wanted to share some things that worked for me personally with my HS. Hopefully it can help others as well. I get cysts and boils typically under my arms and groin area, occasionally under my breasts. It mostly flares up under my arms. \n\nSo step 1, I changed my diet completely. Cut out red meats, and started eating raw veggies. I also let go of soda (this was hard because me and Sprite had a deep relationshipüòì) and most sugars. I saw a change within a month of doing that, but I still get the occasional flare up, although it's not as bad. \n\nTURMERIC. Eat it, drink it, rub it on your skin, inject it into your veins. I made turmeric and black pepper pills for inflammation, and I take two in the morning. Along with that, about 3 times a week, I rub the problem areas with a turmeric/bentonite clay mixture, let it dry, rinse, and exfoliate with a turmeric and sugar scrub. This has reduced the appearance of scars and dark marks. I put this under my arms and my inner thighs/groin area.\n\nIf I start to get a boil/cyst, I wash with hibiclens soap and apply tea tree oil with almond oil (tea tree is strong and can burn if you don't mix it with another carrier oil so be careful). \n\nEpsom salt baths help when I get a particularly painful spot on my groin area (this usually happens around that time of the month). \n\nThis isn't a cure. I definitely still have HS, but it's soooooo much better following this routine. I know it can seem like we try so many different things to alleviate pain, but I promise alot of this stuff you can make at home from things you can get from the grocery store, so it's inexpensive as well. I hope this helps somebody out there‚ù§",

    "body": "I've been struggling with chronic fungal infections for about 25 years. Seven years ago I got scleroderma. Add to all that normal aging, chronic acne, and deflating like a balloon after losing 90 pounds and my skin was quite literally falling apart. Thick, hard and calloused in some places, tissue-paper thin in others. Spots, rings, pigment spots, angry rashes, cystic acne, and on and on. I was a total mess.\n\nCarnivore helped my skin so much, but I needed to find a way to seal the deal and now I'm on a whole new level. I added each of these things one at a time and had an improvement with each one on their own, so I know that it really is the combination - with the diet - that's turned things around. Just one of these things wouldn't work on its own, so I guess you could say this is my skin-care system.\n\n\\- The first thing is that I started eating a piece of wild caught salmon (almost) every day, fried in lard. I get it by the bag at Costco and $100 will do me for a month. Cheaper than taking supplements. This not only helps my skin, but helps everything.\n\n\\- A slice of raw liver 2-3 times a week. Yes, it has to be raw. I never got these results with cooked or desiccated liver before. I hate liver, but the whole thing is over in less than a minute. If anyone wants my technique to get down raw liver without the taste or the trauma, let me know. (My doctor taught me and it works!)\n\n\\- Sunbathing. I bought into the propaganda and avoided the sun like a vampire for nearly 20 years. But 10-20 minutes per side 3-4 times a week has done amazing things for my skin. At first, there was a small step backwards that I found concerning, but after a few days it just got better and better and better.\n\n\\- Bathing with lard. My skin is super sensitive and I've gradually worked my way down to the gentlest baby soap for sensitive skin then to natural soaps (found out that I react badly to many essential oils) then to straight olive and coconut oil. (I figured that if it was good enough for the Romans, why not?) The oils did the least harm but didn't exactly do anything good either.\n\nBut lard is something else. I keep a dish of it in the shower. I just grab a chunk out of the dish and rub my hands together just like lathering up a bar of soap. Once it's all over my palms, I put what's left of the lump back in the dish and rub the lard all over. Repeat as necessary to get the whole body. Buff off with a towel after I'm done with my shower. Yes, I really do feel clean. And no, I don't smell one bit.\n\n\\- Every three days I do a coffee scrub (also made with lard) to exfoliate. My skin has never been so nice. I've been using a coffee/lard/brown sugar scrub, but I just got rid of my skin fungus and the sugar makes me nervous. So I made a coffee/lard/pickling salt scrub today. We'll see if that works as well.\n\nAfter I'm bathed and buffed I alternate between a vitamin D oil or a vitamin K cream for my face and neck. (Yes, I use regular deodorant. The natural stuff causes me to either break out in a rash or a fungal infection.)\n\n\\- I live in the desert and sometimes even all that isn't enough to protect the skin from the arid climate. So sometimes I also apply a homemade lard/coconut oil lotion. I put the recipe below. (If anyone knows of an animal fat that's liquid at room temp, let me know.)\n\n\\- Bentonite clay mask. I use this when I feel like it. It shrinks pores and exfoliates, but does dry out the skin so I don't use it often. Once a month I slather my whole body up with it, stand still and play Sudoku for about 20 minutes while it dries, then rinse it off. Seems to help with the skin firming - and that's a bit of a problem with the weight loss.\n\nJust mix the clay with water exactly like mixing grout. If you make a big batch, you can add a little rubbing alcohol into the mix and keep it in the fridge so it'll store for a few months.\n\n\\- When I feel a rare pimple coming on, I use the clay.\n\nHere's a video explaining how to use it. My friend has tried this lady's technique and swears by it, but I haven't had the opportunity. If I feel that tell-tale itch I do an immediate spot treatment and so far that just stops it right there. Before this, I was using hydrocortisone cream and I can't tell a difference.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gRLfE5S7pg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gRLfE5S7pg)\n\nI look about 20 years younger than I did. I have ZERO fungus on my skin for the first time in 25 years. I haven't had a scleroderma flare in months thanks to the carnivore diet, but this skin-care system has successfully reversed most of the previously-inflicted damage.\n\nDidn't help with scarring (although the scars are softer and less angry-looking), helped skin regain elasticity, but did tighten it up enough to smooth out the wrinkles on my face and neck. My gaping pores are \\*much\\* smaller than they were. No acne. No blackheads. No irritation. The redness from the scleroderma has reduced dramatically. The only place where I still have an issue with scleroderma involves the skin constriction on my palms. We'll give it time and see where that goes. All I can say is that the people who know me best are suitably impressed and are carting my fat bombs and clay out of here by the shopping bag. (It's cheap, so I give this stuff as gifts) And yes. My husband and guy friends are using all this crap, too.\n\nFat heals, people!\n\nEASY, SIMPLE, NATURAL LOTION\n\n\\- 1/2 cup lard or tallow\n\n\\- 1/2 cup coconut,MCT,olive oil. Whatever you want as long as it's liquid at room temp (if anybody knows of an animal fat that stays liquid, let me know. I need that information)\n\n\\- 1 oz beeswax pellets (so much easier to mess with than the blocks)\n\n\\- essential oils/herbs/whatever additives you want (optional)\n\n\\- 1 tablespoon rubbing alcohol, vodka, or everclear (as a preservative) or your choice of tincture\n\n\\- 1/2 to 1 cup very cold water (you can blend in herbs and ice at this stage, too. Just remember to strain the tea before blending)\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\n\\-Set up a large glass bowl in a pan as a double broiler.\n\n\\-Add oil and beeswax\n\n\\-Heat until all the beeswax is melted (about 170 F)\n\n\\-remove from heat and add your alcohol/essential oils or whatever\n\n\\-allow to cool until it takes on a soft-butter consistency (about 100-120F). The key here is for it to be as cool as possible, but still not solid.\n\n\\-gradually add the cold water to the mix with a stick blender. only add a tiny bit at a time and don't add your next dose until the previous one is fully incorporated\n\n\\- Once the batch refuses to accept more water, you're done. (I have had them only take on 1/2 cup, but it may take up to a full cup, depending on the fats used)\n\nmost of the time is taken up with allowing the mixture to cool. can take a full five minutes of blending to get the water in.\n\nLasts about 3 weeks at room temp and up to 5 months in the fridge. (I put mine in baby food jars, so I can leave out a bit at a time)\n\nEASIEST CARNIVORE LIP BALM\n\nBy weight:\n\n\\- 3 parts beef tallow or lard\n\n\\- 1 part bees wax pellets\n\nMelt in a double broiler. Pour into tubes or jars or whatever you want. Takes on the consistency of Chapstick and is very stable.\n\nThe easiest way I do this is measure out some lard and bees wax into a tiny jar. Set the jar in a pot with about 1/2 inch of water. Bring it up to a simmer and keep an eye on it until all the contents melts. Then put the lid on it, give it a swirl to mix, and I'm done. Zero mess and no clean up.",

She's been doing some fancy ones lately, but this one was so over the top good that I had to share it:\n\nhttp://m.imgur.com/gallery/KonuuuP\n\nHere is what she wrote on  facebook about it:\n\nMy first attempt at woodgrain. I need to make some adjustments. This was my disaster soap. While I was making it I had a crying baby (in the other room), I slipped and fell dropping some of my soap batter, and I dropped one of my squeeze bottles in my soap. So with everything that went wrong I was happy with the results.\n\nFor the bark, for part of my oils I used oil that was infused with alkanet. Before I poured the bark I sprinkled my mold with alfalfa powder, bentonite clay, coffee grounds, cacao powder, and activated charcoal. I also added AC and cacao powder to the bark. For the inside. I used cacao powder, AC, tomato powder, turmeric powder, and cacao powder. It is scented with an EO blend of cedar leaf, citronella, eucalyptus, galbanum, lemon, and patchouli.\n\nHere is how I did the bark. I peeled some pieces of bark off of dead trees. Then I made a silicone mold, pressing the bark into the silicone. When the mold was done, I sprinkled bentonite clay, coffee grounds, alfalfa powder, and cocoa powder on it. I made up a batter of soap and poured it onto my mold. The next day I unmolded it an curved it and set it in a wood mold. Then I used the woodgrain soap method in the bark soap and did it CPOP. I liked the ash on it so I left most of it.",

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/l049Rrhp7mg)\n\nDeclaration Grooming (https://www.declarationgrooming.com/) launched their upgraded base, known as Milksteak, on October 12, 2019. The launch included Declaration Grooming‚Äôs annual release of their fall season scent, the iconic, Darkfall. Declaration Grooming is known for producing amazing soap, aftershave and cologne offerings as well as highly sought after hand tied badger brushes. The Ferndale, MI artisan  is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)) and The Stray Whisker ([https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/](https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/)).\n\nDarkfall is a spicy oriental with roots of autumn in the rural south. Scent notes are listed as; Agarwood, Cinnamon, Amber, Clove, Benzoin, Birch Tar and Treemoss. This is a hearty, warming scent that is well complemented by spiciness and smoke. The fragrance shines during the cool, damp and dark days of late fall. This is a masculine, bold scent. Mrs. Ruds finds this fragrance neutral. She neither loves it, nor hates it. Her only ask was that it is used in casual settings. Strength of scent is mid-strong off the container and remains this way for the entire shave. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Chatillon Lux /Declaration Grooming Bon Vivant as a similar scent profile.\n\nIt is no secret, Declaration Grooming Milksteak base is the highest rated soap to date in the ShaveScore system. Listed ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Yogurt, Buttermilk, Egg Whites, Coconut Milk, Goat's Milk, Tocopheryl Acetate, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract,  Arctium lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Silk Amino Acids. This soap is on the firmer side of mid and is a mindlessly easy loading soap. The soap is thirsty, but not as thirsty as the most thirsty soaps. With water and agitation, the soap base explodes into a creamy, dense lather that has a consistency similar to Greek yogurt. While improvement over Icarus is only slight, the slickness is definitely improved. Primary and residual slickness are elite in performance, probably the slickest lather that I have ever experienced. Post shave is the absolute best I have experienced in a soap base to date. The post shave feeling is pure luxury. Declaration Milksteak soap base is a sheer pleasure to use. Given this experience and the improvements, Declaration Grooming Milksteak receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in soap bases I suggest: Wholly Kaw Siero and Zingariman Sebo.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Darkfall (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù (purchased)\n* Razor - Razorock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Declaration Grooming Darkfall (loaner)",

    "body": "I've been pretty lucky overall with skincare-- the usual teenage/early 20s hormonal woes, but nothing too dramatic. My \"skincare routine\" (when I remembered to follow it) was just the stuff my mother passed down from her routine in the 80s. I tried to copy her but ended up being moisturizer-phobic because it only ever made my face feel greasy and made my teenage breakouts worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, about two years ago (I'm 25 now), I started getting awful, painful, deep cystic acne on my cheeks-- something that had never happened before. No clue what caused it, since if anything my lifestyle got healthier in that time. And NOTHING I did seemed to help. None of my usual applications (oxy-10 and clearasil wash) worked. Nothing made a dent. And when I coaxed them to a head and popped them to relieve the pain, they caused BIG, DARK purple scars that were very visible on my very, very light skin. Yikes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I found this sub and started trying new stuff. I switched to micellar water. I added some serums (Vitamin C is bae). I cooled it with the harsh masks. I put some real effort into it. But I would NOT touch moisturizer, no matter what the sub said. I figured my skin was just too oily and it would mess it up like it did in my youth. So while my skin overall felt better, there was something clearly not getting reached in the depths of my cheeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then I was buying groceries last week and spotted some CeraVe cream. And I thought, \"F- it, why not?\"\n\nY'ALL. A week. One WEEK of difference and it's been dramatic. The bumps are shrinking, the pigmentation is fading, and the ache is gone. My skin is finally, seriously clearing up. I have changed nothing else in my skincare, just added a moisturizer. While I know a week isn't long term and things could still change, I've seen that happen before and this time I really think it's a lasting change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never doubt the wiki's advice again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: YOU REALLY DO NEED A MOISTURIZER, THEY AREN'T KIDDING. DON'T BE LIKE ME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Since folks were asking here's my whole routine:  \nGarnier Micellar Water, blue lid (no rinsing, may go over more than once if I'm wearing a lot of makeup)\n\nSpot treat with 10% Benzoil Peroxide (I usually get generic)\n\nHonest Beauty Depuff Eye Gel\n\nHonest Beauty Vitamin C Radiance Serum\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream\n\nPimple patches as needed for super nasty ones\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's identical morning and night. Sometimes I'll do a bentonite clay or African black soap mask, but that's on a pause until I know all the impacts of the new moisturizer. I'm considering adding a mild chemical exfoliant (Pixi's glow tonic looks nice) but that's also on hold as I watch the moisturizer.",

    "body": "After being infected for 7 years, but just finding  out in October, I followed this protocol from mid November to Jan 1. Before that I took some herbs like garlic, mint, and turmeric but not in an organized manner. I only took a PPI for a few days before having unpleasant side effects. I never took any antibiotics, though I had them on hand in case the herbs didn't work. I tested positive in October with a CLO and endoscopy, maybe the most specific kind of test. Then after my protocol, I tested negative 3 times with home stool tests. But I wanted more certainty, so I did this urea breath test at Quest Diagnostics. \n\nWhether to take antibiotics or not is a personal choice. But if a doctor tells you ( like mine did) that the only way to eradicate H Pylori is with pharmaceuticals,  they're wrong.\n\nDiet: minimal fructose, PUFA, grains other than rice.

    "body": "**Obligatory SOTD pic:**  https://i.imgur.com/VZ4NU1A.jpg\n\n**Noble Otter Soap Co. | Kaboom!**\n\n**Island Bladeworks \"Stoya\" | Elite Razor Manchurian**\n\n**The New Improved Schick Injector Razor | Personna 74**\n\nI regret waiting this long to experience Noble Otter's products.  There is just an overwhelming array of artisans on the scene, Noble Otter just hadn't made it to my radar.  Fortunately, a fellow wet shaver gave me a heads-up regarding this limited release, and I snagged a set.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the artisan acquiesced to a small faction of followers who were pining for a dupe of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb EdT.  While the quaint hand-drawn modification of their label intended for the unscented offering, \"Bare\", is charming, it's my understanding moves are being made to have more professional labels for future limited offerings.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, the container is a standard rigid ~~89~~ 100 mm Parkway polypropylene tub holding approximately 4 oz. of product topped with a matching threaded lid.  The satin-finish waterproof labels are straight and devoid of blemish or bubbles.  The art is crisp and the text is easy to read.  The overall design is both classy and whimsical, the focal point of which obviously being the austere otter.  In the regular offerings, the otter's attire is reportedly indicative of the respective fragrance.  Perhaps it's been done elsewhere, but this aspect is reminiscent of Zoologist's scheme.  My only critique would be that the actual Noble Otter brand name and stylized logo is small and somewhat difficult to feature in a SOTD photograph unless one employs a macro shot.  Of course, the understated text is probably by-design in keeping with the formal presentation.  The aftershave splash is the standard 4 oz. glass amber apothecary bottle with ribbed threaded black lid that was secured with a break-away safety seal.\n\nOff the tub, the scent strength is quite light, but it essentially doubles (I refuse to say \"explodes\") upon lathering, opening with a fresh spicy clean resin topped by a lemony citrus enveloped by a rounded floral that stops just short of rose.  The fragrance warms up with time revealing a leathery tobacco with wisps of cinnamon, never becoming heavy.  The paired splash presents similarly, but certainly sharper bergamot in the opening.  The spiciness is more distinct in the splash, and this phase obviously lasts longer before warming up.  The leather and tobacco, while still present in the splash's dry down aren't as easily separated suggesting a skilled blending.  After about three hours, I begin to lose the fragrance just as the cinnamon steps in.  There is also a final smoky sweetness in the vanilla realm.  I think I went nose blind at the four-hour mark because I could no longer detect it, but my wife did. \n\nI have no experience with target fragrance, so I can't speak to the accuracy.  I did, however find it to be pleasant enough that I'm entertaining the thought of picking up a bottle of the Spicebomb EdT or the \"Extreme\" variant EdP.  My limited research suggests the two versions do differ in more than strength, so if someone can tell me which fragrance more closely matches Kaboom!, I'd appreciate it.\n\nIn terms of performance, if not for the thirst, this beef tallow base could pass for a Talbot shaving creation, loading and lathering in a very similar nature.  Noble Otter functions with moderate hydration, yielding a voluminous thick lather similar to high-butter vegan bases like that of PAA's Crown King base.  However, if you stop here, there is a bit of spackling which is a good indicator that more water will optimize it.  Prior to the shave, test palm lathers proved this base can handle a fair bit of water thereby achieving elite levels of slickness, so I proceeded to push the water for the head and face lathering.  Slickness is competitive with any soap I've tried.  Residual slickness takes that up a notch more such that long sweeping scalp passes were easily obtained on residual slickness alone.  Being a shower shaver, I'm less concerned with where the lather falls, but with this kind of slickness, my carelessness made the all metal Schick injector a little precarious to hold on to.  This is incredible slickness despite my hard water.\n\nThe post shave is also similar to Talbot's and Catie's Bubbles' jojoba bases.  That is to say, the post shave is spectacular, requiring no post-product whatsoever. Thus the splash was simply about continuing the experience.  I was surprised with how the splash was distributed.  Using only a couple in my palm to spread on my dome and face, my hand glided as if the splash were mostly oil.  I anticipated at least some degree of greasiness, but instead, it soaked right in leaving a silky smooth, natural feel.  I searched the ingredients for something like glycerin, but it's not there.  This surprising slickness could be attributed to reconstitution of the soap base, but I thoroughly rinse in the shower and towel dry before I apply aftershave, so I fine that to be unlikely.\n\nUltimately, this was a perfect shave both in terms of enjoyable fragrance and high-level performance.\n\n*DISCLOSURE:  I purchased the aforementioned products for retail price directly from the artisan's web site.  I received no gifts or other incentives in return for my comments.*\n\nSOAP INGREDIENTS: stearic acid, beef tallow, coconut milk, aloe vera, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, castor oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, lanolin, tucuma seed butter, kokum butter, sodium hydroxide, bentonite clay, tocopheral acetate, citric acid, watermelon extract, whitewillow bark extract, tussah silk.*\n\nAFTERSHAVE INGREDIENTS:  denatured alcohol, witch hazel, water, sodium lactate, panthenol, carrot extract, chamomile extract, seaweed extract.*\n\n*Fragrance is an assumed ingredient. As previously stated, the labels are from the \"Bare\" unscented variety and have been modified by hand to accommodate this limited fragrance.\n\nBONUS PIC:  https://i.imgur.com/cMRQNYR.jpg",

After it dries I put bentonite clay ( or kaolin clay which has been shown to be much gentler on some people)  into my hair brush and brush it through. It banishes all residue oil, lifts my roots, makes it look and feel so much thicker, and makes it look like I just did a shampoo. \n\n(In process of editing smell part in light of new info. Do not put essential oils in water to make scented spray like I've done. I will be stopping using this immediately. \n\nhttps://uk.puressentiel.com/blogs/our-tips/misusing-essential-oils-dangers\n\nMaybe try a hair perfume instead)\n\n\n\nFor flakes or scalp buildup take a cup of sugar or salt (or both) put only enough water or milk to make it the consistency of a body or facial scrub and massage into scalp until the grains dissolve then rinse thoroughly with water and continue the rest of the routine. It truely works wonders. \n\n\nWarning for using salt. May be too rough and drying for some scalps. Always use sugar scrubs first. I recommend using once a week. Be gentle if needed more often.",

First if your water is hard, get a filter that removes minerals, because hard water can push the scalp pH to being too alkaline, which actually encourages more sebum/oil production leading to greasiness, when you keep the pH in the ideal range (between 4.0‚Äê5.5) the sebaceous glands don't need to overproduce oil. I dont need to wash my hair for weeks for this reason because my hair just doesn't get oily anymore. Be careful though with products you use because most people don't even realize they apply products that disrupt the pH balance of the scalp. Amla, rose water, diluted ACV, and acidic rinses can all lower the pH of the scalp to the ideal range. You'll notice you can prevent grease by mastering this.

    "body": "Three weeks ago, my mod /u/drunkenposting asked whether there were safe havens:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/87krto/your_country_of_residence_if_you_care_to_share/?st=jg1avncd&sh=05de9cb9\n\nApparently, none of the old subscribers remember what they read and the new subscribers do not use Reddit's search engine to find answers. While a mod of /r/gangstalking in 2014 - 2015, I had posted on eluding and on radio free zones:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/38op8d/part_1_why_other_ti_websites_do_not_have/?st=jg1azqox&sh=71bea31f\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3l2otg/are_non_nato_countries_safe_havens_to_elude_to/?st=jg1b1bxi&sh=84af73ab\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3niioj/wiki_what_not_to_do_after_successfully_eluding/?st=jg1axnps&sh=08c766fc\n\n/u/drunkenposting disclosed he resides in Virginia:\n\n>I moved to Virginia, so unfortunately I'm still in the DMV area. Much further out, though.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/87krto/your_country_of_residence_if_you_care_to_share/dwfqtfv/?st=jg1auzwq&sh=05eafb5c\n\nThough I rarely have time to read posts in /r/gangstalking any more, I read his post. This saved me from having the regret had I only read his post and replied, I could possibly have saved him. I tried.\n\nI could not comment because /u/pogomaster12, the mod who replaced me, had banned me for requesting performance of Tok-A-Mak's promise to refer. Therefore, I PM /u/drunkenposting.  Our PMs are at:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/8cighp/suicided_eluding_radio_free_zones_our_mod/dxf6ldi/?st=jg1e00wq&sh=93c0888c\n\nThe radio free zone in West Virginia is a mere several hour trip by car from Virginia. West Virginia was annexed from Virginia during the Civil War. /u/drunkenposting refusing to drive several hours is exemplary of TIs being self centered and selfish. Yes, the majority of TIs are.  Explanation is at:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/8cighp/suicided_eluding_radio_free_zones_our_mod/dxfw5mq/?st=jg1uy1e6&sh=7200e85e\n\n\nFor over two years, I have been writing radio free zones may be possible safe havens. I have been downsizing to prepare to relocate. For over two years, we have waited for subscribers to follow through. They haven't. Even /u/drunkenposting. \n\nLast year, I invited /u/drunkenposting to mod /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics. He accepted the invitation but didn't perform any mod duties. I encouraged him to post. He choose to post in his own sub. Own subs act like one's own Facebook. Reddit is not Facebook. \n\nFour days ago, /u/drunkenposting announced being suicide in his own sub but not the other two subs he mods:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/MyTortureJournal/comments/8bmm4n/im_trying_to_commit_suicide_tonight/?st=jg1bnuso&sh=59217209\n\nHad drunkenposting wanted targeted individuals (TIs) to encourage him to live, wouldn't he have posted in other TI subs? Had he wanted to generate publicity of the plight of TIs, wouldn't he have posted in large subs? Or in downtown Washington, DC talking into a bull horn, wearing a poster and handling out flyers all day before committing suicide.\n\nI do not subscribe to /r/MyTortureJournal. Two days ago, /u/triscuitzop PM me regretting that he did not see his post in time. Thank you /u/triscuitzop for notifying me. Two nights ago, I logged into Reddit. I was knocked out unconscious for 4 1/2 hours. Last night immediately after I went on a computer, the torturers made me semi conscious. They rendered me incapable of Redditing.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/87z72d/torture_tactics_brain_zapping_vs_knocked_out/?st=jg1czro7&sh=8e323a6e\n\nI read /u/triscuitzop's notice today, Sunday, April 15, 2018.\n\n/u/triscuitzop's notifying me is not enough. /u/drunkenposting was a subscriber and poster in /r/gangstalking. I request /u/triscuitzop to crosspost my post in /r/gangstalking.\n\nWill someone honor /u/drunkenposting's suicide by checking out the radio free zone next door to his corpse? Plant a tree with a huge memorial sign stating a TI may have possibly survived had they lived here. Submit a meter report. Archive the meter report into wikis. Cite the wikis to answer future TIs questions on safe havens when they haven't bothered to read our wikis.\n\nFailure to read the shielding wikis and to shield contributed to drunkenposting's suicide:\n\n[]from drunkenposting sent 24 days ago\n\n>To be honestly I haven't experimented with anything beyond rudimentary shielding yet. I don't really have the money right now to do so, but maybe in the future I'll try it.\n\nI had replied sea salt is a mere $.69 per pound at the health food store. Granular bentonite clay is affordable too. our PMs on shielding are at:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/8cighp/suicided_eluding_radio_free_zones_our_mod/dxfau8a/?st=jg1oqeul&sh=3be892a4\n\nI hold /u/Tok-A-Mak partially responsible for /u/drunkenposting's suicide. A nonTI should not be the head mod of a TI sub. /u/Tok-A-Mak took over /r/gangstalking in /r/redditrequest. In 2015, he censored directed energy weapons, ultrasound, meter reports, shielding, implants, stasi, etc. and simultaneously without warning demoded five mods including me. /u/Tok-A-Mak recommended we create a sub on the topics he censored. He breached his promise to refer /r/targetedenergyweapons. The mods of /r/gangstalking continue to breach promise:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79cdf5/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_2_is_head_mod/?st=jg1diinf&sh=59e91eb8\n\nI had foreseen the consequences of a TI sub censoring directed energy weapons and shielding:\n\n>All three mods of /r/gangstalking are complicit in perpetuating physical torture and slow kill.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/78snvc/closing_rtargetedindividuals_please_subscribe_to/dp0rcfc/?st=jg1eixay&sh=2d09b9fb\n\nThough /u/drunkenposting is a mod of /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics, he neither had read the wikis nor asked for help. He asked for help in /r/gangstalking. A sub that had banned the very topics he needed help in. The subscribers of /r/gangstalking do not read old posts. They are ignorant on what was posted prior to Tok-A-Mak's censorship. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. In this case, ignorance lead to suicide. None of the subscribers have knowledge of this as none of the mods announced the suicide in their own sub.\n\nPractically being the only TI who researches and recommends eluding, radio free zones and shielding on Reddit may have lowered my credibility. Hive mind takes over. The majority don't discuss these topics because they lack knowledge of them. Hive mind wins. Do nothing but bitch. By demodding five mods, /r/ganstalking turned into a chat room.\n\nWe need more mods and subscribers to answer shielding questions by referring the shielding wikis. We need wiki contributors to update the wikis. I cannot keep do it all.\n",

It has the amazing drawing power will help to clean out the pores. It removes excess sebum and is an excellent exfoliant. Bentonite Clay has natural antibacterial properties as well, and will dramatically speed the healing of the pimples.\"\n\nTIP: [You should mix it with raw apple cider vinegar, not water.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19i8w1/psa_aztec_secret_aka_calcium_bentonite_clay/)\n\n---\n\nFrench Green (aka Sea Clay) \n\npH: 7.75 \n\nAll skin types\n\n\n\"French Green Clay contains micro molecules which absorb better than other clays. It is highly efficient at drawing oils from the skin. French Green Clay is rich in important minerals and phyto-nutrients and is the commonly used therapeutic clay.\"\n\n---\n\nFuller's Earth (aka Bleaching Clay) \n\npH: 7.5 \n\nAll skin types - good for oily and acne-prone skin\n\n\n\"Fuller‚Äôs Earth clay is a naturally occurring sedimentary clay composed mainly of alumina, silica, iron oxides, lime, and magnesia.  It has been widely used as a skin-lightening agent, and it produces a lightening effect on the outer epidermal layer of the skin. Because of its enormous drawing capabilities, Fuller‚Äôs Earth clay draws and absorbs oil from the skin, and is the number one choice for those with oily skin or those who are prone to acne.\"\n\n\nTIP: To make a smooth consistency, add a dollop of yogurt.\n\n---\n\nRhassoul (aka Red Moroccan or Red Lava Clay) \n\npH: 7 - 7.5\n\nAll skin types\n\n\n\"Rhassoul clay is a wonderful and effective clay for cleansing and for general skin care treatments. In clinical tests, Rhassoul has been shown to be effective on skin elasticity, clogged pores, removes dead skin layers, removed surface oil from skin, improves skin clarity and appearance, and reduces flakiness and dryness of both the scalp and skin.\"\n\n---\n\nDead Sea Mud (aka Ocean Mud or Black Mineral Mud) \n\npH: 7 \n\nAll skin types\n\n\n\"Dead Sea Mud contains more than 35 minerals. It eliminates dead cells while purifying. It stimulates blood circulation to generate newer and healthier skin cells. Dead Sea Mud revitalizes and firms skin at a cellular level resulting in much younger and tighter looking skin.\"\n\nTIP: Most brands would say it contains natural or active Dead Sea Mud but they are often made of bentonite, kaolin, algae extract and dyes. Always check ingredient list first before buying it.\n\n---\n\n\nKaolin (aka Cosmetic Clay)\n\npH: 6\n\n* Red - Oily skin\n* Green - All skin types\n* White - All skin types\n* Orange - Normal or combination skin\n* Pink - Dry or normal skin\n* Yellow - Dry or sensitive skin\n\n\n\"Kaolin is one of the most versatile clays, and is also the mildest of all clays. It is commonly found in skincare preparations and cosmetics because of its gentle nature, mineral content and absorbent properties.\"\n\nTIP: You can mix kaolin with anything - water, rosewater, coconut water or milk, tea, milk, yogurt, honey, banana, avocado, aloe vera, oil and etc.\n\n---\n\nMoor Mud (aka Therapeutic Peat Moss) \n\npH: 4.5 - 5.5 \n\nAll skin types\n\n\n\"Moor Mud is an organic substance, product of natural decomposition of multitudes of plants under special conditions. Unlike other mud used in the spa industry, it contains no clay and consists of organic residue of herbs, flowers and grasses. It cleanses skin of impurities, improves circulation and makes skin look and feels rejuvenated.\"",

    "body": "Let me preface my post by saying that I am so thankful for finding SCA. I had considered myself a skincare junkie beforehand (Acne.org user), but this sub really solidified that for me. It's a literal addiction! I find the science behind it quite interesting, and love using what's in my arsenal to solve skin 'problems'. It's really interesting to me.\n\n\n[Here is a 'closeup' of my face.](http://i.imgur.com/PAn5RxL.jpg?1) Sorry it's not head-on. This was from a couple of months back. I can provide another picture if needed.\n\n\nI am soon running out of cleanser and moisturizer, so I would like some input on what to get next! I haven't changed my routine up in three years (since I started the Acne.org Regimen) other than adding in small products here and there. \n\n\nI would describe my skin as oily/acne prone. Very oily. However, after reading this sub, I have beliefs that my skin *may* be dehydrated. I'm an 18 year-old male in Toronto, Ontario/London, Ontario (during the school year). My face always has a shine on it, even RIGHT after I put on moisturizer! I'm assuming this could be Glycerin or the Licohalcone (sp?) in my moisturizer (the Acne.org new Moisturizer ‚Äì it's very, very light.) I eat very healthy (I have Celiac disease, so no gluten for me) and am fairly active (gym 4-6 times a week). \n\n\nAnyway, here is my regimen. I am looking for critiques! I don't want to break the bank on skincare products (I already have in the past), as I have a pretty steeply-priced hair removal journey in September. :P\n\n\nPlease let me know if you would like ingredient lists! I can provide those if needed. These routines are my minimal routines that I find myself doing most often. I sub in various other products on certain days.\n\n\n**MORNING ROUTINE:**\n\n* Cleanse with Acne.org Cleanser\n* Pat dry (leaving face slightly damp) \n* Acne.org Moisturizer with 1-2 drops of Jojoba Oil (Acne.org Jojoba Oil) \nOR\n* Acne.org AHA + Glycolic Acid Cream (If I use this in the morning, I won't at night)\n\n**NIGHT ROUTINE:**\n\n* Cleanse with Clinique Facial Soap Mild (clear green bottle)\n* Jojoba Oil underneath eyes (one drop)\n* Acne.org Benzoyl Peroxide cream (Only on certain days ‚Äì when I have breakouts; I apply this liberally to my entire face)\n* Acne.org AHA + Glycolic Acid Cream with 1-3 drops of Jojoba Oil (10 minutes after BP has set in)\n\n**OTHER INFO/PRODUCTS:**\n\n* I have been taking Fish oil with 1000mg of Omega 3, 300mg of EPA, and 200mg of DHA, twice daily for a year. \n* I have been taking a liquid gel multivitamin once a day (NOW Adam's Superior Men's Multi) since November. \n* Once a week I use the Aztec Secret Bentonite Clay with Bragg's ACV. \n* On some mornings, I use a L'Or√©al eye roller with caffeine to get rid of dark circles. Doesn't ever work, but I've been trying to use it up. \n* I try and do the OCM (EVOO, Jojoba Oil, Tea Tree Oil) a couple times per week. \n* I'm always gentle with my face and often try and use cold/chilled water to cleanse.\n* Once or twice a week I will use a [Body Shop Facial Buffer with my Clinique Facial Cleanser](http://www.thebodyshop.ca/en/skin-care/skin-care-accessories/facial-buffer.aspx). Is this too harsh? I'm always gentle with it, but I feel like I always wake up with oily skin when I use it. \n\n\nIn general, I have been using blotting sheets and those harsh brown paper towelettes from public washrooms to combat oily skin. I often wake up with a very oily face (even on nights where I have put on only moisturizer!) My only complaint about my skin is how oily it gets (I've pretty well mastered the acne side of things). I drink enough water and my diet is very healthy, so I'm not entirely sure what else could cause my oiliness. I also just ordered NuFountain's C10 Serum which should arrive sometime this week. \n\n\nCritiques? Thoughts?\n\n\nThank you SCA! Love you guys!",

Known originally as L&L Grooming, Scott's company has grown to become a staple of the internet wetshaving community. Declaration has established itself in both soap and brushmaking, claiming some of the best performing products in both categories.\n\n    Scott often collaborates with Shawn Maher of Chatillon Lux, a boutique fragrance house out of St. Louis, Missouri. These collaborations have been some of DG's most popular releases, and I believe Gratiot League Square is no exception.\n\n    Declaration Grooming uses relatively standard plastic soap tubs and slightly less common rectangular bottles that are nice and stylish. DG uses a standard labelling system with the same art in different colors and a slightly altered background for each scent. I really like unique label art, but of the brands that maintain one label for the entire line, I like Declaration's design the best.\n\n    Gratiot League Square is a fragrance designed to recall a day in the markets of Carondolet, a small settlement on the bluffs of the Mississippi near historic Saint Louis. Its scent notes are listed as: *tobacco, leather, rose, clove, nutmeg, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla, musk, bergamot, and amber.*\n\n\n    Gratiot League Square has a moderately strong scent off the puck that opens into a powerful bouquet once lathered. Light and airy notes of rose, colored with the honeyed sweetness of amber and heightened further by a touch of bergamot are the first to greet the senses. Smooth and strong leather melds into the accord, grounding it slightly and overlaying a rich and earthy tobacco note. The mellow melange of leather fades away, leaving the intermingled balance of sweet rose and tobacco as sandalwood, smokey vetiver and a touch of animalic musk join the tobacco at the heart of this scent. A spicy touch of clove rises above and provides a crisp closure to the fragrance.\n\n    The aftershave and Edp provide a more transparent medium for the scent than the soap base, bringing out more rose and helping to distinguish the vetiver and sandalwood from the tobacco at the base of this fragrance.\n \n    Gratiot League Square is a slightly fresher and more versatile take on the sweet and spicy tobacco genre. The leading edge of fresh rose and bergamot makes this scent feel more at home during summer months than most tobacco fragrances.\n\n\n    My tub of Gratiot League Square comes in Declaration Grooming's Milksteak Base, but the scent was produced in Icarus as well. \nThe ingredients for the Milksteak Version are: *Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Yogurt, Buttermilk, Egg Whites, Coconut Milk, Goat‚Äôs Milk, Tocopheryl Acetate, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract, Arctium lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Silk Amino Acids*\n\n    Milksteak is an elite base and one of my personal top 3 bases (right behind A&E Kaizen and Wholly Kaw Siero) and the ingredients list helps to illustrate why. From white willow bark to sea buckthorn fruit extracts, this soap contains a range of skin foods.\n\n    Milksteak takes quite a lot of water to reach its peak performance, but once properly hydrated, this lather is extremely slick and protective. Residual slickness is not quite as good as Kaizen or Siero but only ever so slightly, and Milksteak is the equal of these amazing bases in every other way.\n\n\n    I've probably made it overly clear throughout  this review, that I really enjoy this soap and this fragrance. Gratiot League Square is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy with a hearty helping of earthy tobacco, yet it still remains a light and pleasant, approachable scent. It should be no surprise then that GLS is slotting into the top spot this week, displacing A&E's Vanille de Tabac which has held the lead for the last 4 weeks. These are both amazing fragrances in top tier soap bases, but GLS takes the edge for wearabilaty and originality.\n\n  With only 2 weeks remaining the rankings for The Tobacco Throwdown are:\n\n* [#1.

    "body": "[Video](https://youtu.be/E7Elkc6hLPA)\n\nDeclaration Grooming (https://www.declarationgrooming.com/) launched their upgraded base, known as Milksteak, on October 12, 2019. Declaration Grooming is known for featuring amazing soap, aftershave and cologne offerings as well as highly sought after hand tied badger brushes. This one man band is based out of Ferndale, MI and is highly passionate about every single aspect of running this successful small business. Declaration Grooming is available for purchase direct from their website and also stockists such as Maggard Razors ([http://www.maggardrazors.com/](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)), West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)), Top of the Chain ([https://topofthechain.ca/](https://topofthechain.ca/)) and The Stray Whisker ([https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/](https://www.thestraywhisker.com.au/)). \\*\\*\\*Check out Latherhog‚Äôs scent review: https://youtu.be/MTcMtr922CA\\*\\*\\*\n\nMassacre of the Innocents is a dupe of the highly regarded Herod by Parfums de Marly. The scent is a woody, spicy accord featuring notes of; cinnamon, pepperwood, osmanthus, tobacco leaves, frankincense, cistus, vanilla, cedar, vetiver, patchouli and musk. This is a bold, spicy and resinous fragrance. It is quite masculine and despite its boldness, it is not edgy. Mrs. Ruds approves of this fragrance as a casual wear. Strength of scent is mid out of the container and for the shave‚Äôs duration. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Ariana & Evans Vanille de Tabac as a similar scent profile.    \n\nDeclaration Grooming Milksteak base aims to improve on the already elite Icarus soap base. Listed ingredients are: Stearic Acid, Water, Castor Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Vegetable Glycerin, Bison Tallow, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Shea Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Lanolin, Bentonite Clay, Yogurt, Buttermilk, Egg Whites, Coconut Milk, Goat's Milk, Tocopheryl Acetate, Maltodextrin, Milk Protein, Salix Alba L. (White Willow) Bark Extract,  Arctium lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Silk Amino Acids. This soap is on the firmer side of mid and is a mindlessly easy loading soap. The soap is thirsty, but not as thirsty as the most thirsty soaps. With water and agitation, the soap base explodes into a creamy, dense lather that has a consistency similar to Greek yogurt. While improvement over Icarus is only slight, the slickness is definitely improved. Primary and residual slickness are elite in performance, probably the slickest lather that I have ever experienced. Post shave is the absolute best I have experienced in a soap base to date. The post shave feeling is pure luxury. Declaration Milksteak soap base is a sheer pleasure to use. Somehow it elevates the shaving experience to a level few have achieved. Given this experience and the improvements, Declaration Grooming Milksteak receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in soap bases I suggest: Murphy & McNeil Kodiak and Barrister and Mann.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Declaration Grooming Massacre of the Innocents (purchased)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave ‚ÄúTusk‚Äù (purchased)\n* Razor - Wellington (purchased)\n* Post - Declaration Grooming Massacre of the Innocents (purchased)",

Then I'll get notified of your post and be able to integrate your information with everything else!\n\nIdeas of things to include:\n\nWhat is your hair's porosity, how long have you been doing nopoo, is your hair damaged, dyed, bleached, henna'd, etc\n\nDoes it work when washing with only hard water\n\nDoes it remove hard water wax\n\nDoes it remove significant amounts of oils like if you did a warm oil treatment or just a little like if you wash with it 1-3 times a week\n\nHow do you apply it (paste, slurry, liquid, tea, on dry, damp, or dripping hair)\n\nHow does it make your hair feel when it's in your hair (for example, straight gram flour makes my hair feel very tangly when it's on and for a little while after it's been rinsed off)\n\nHow does it feel after your hair has dried\n\nDoes it need a conditioning rinse\n\nIs it moisturizing\n\nIs it drying\n\nDoes it build up protein on your hair\n\nAnything else you feel might be relevant\n\nHere's what I've got so far, help me to evaluate it :)\n\nManufactured No-poo: a product that advertises and appears to follow the limitations and philosophy of natural haircare. Classified as low-poo because it is difficult to know for sure just what has been done to the ingredients. Does not include OH-poo (saponified) products as those have their own category and needs. \n\n**Morocco Method** - 'shampoos' based on a combination of saponins, acv and bentonite clay with many other herbs and oils added in focused on different effects. They have an entire line of no-poo hair care products including 'shampoo', creme rinse, masks, hair spray, styling gel, healing and growth serums. \n\nWorks with hard water. Removes wax buildup. Works with henna'd hair. Works with all hair types, though the different ones can work differently. You only use a small amount, either applied by dipping your fingertips in the concentrated product and massaging into the scalp and allowed to run diluted along the hair, or diluted into a drench and poured on, massaged in and through the hair and then rinsed off. Has a penetrating and potent smell of Indian aurvedic herbs that can last several days. \n\nAll their products appear to be packaged in recyclable plastic containers. I don't know if they offer refill friendly things. \n\n**ManeLine** - a saponin based product using Shikakai and herbs. They also have a less grainy version for those who struggle with the Shikakai grains. Should work with hard water. Should remove wax. I don't know much more about it... \n\nThank you u/JeF4y for your detailed answer! \n\nUpdate: Apparently ManeLine has gone out of business. They will be missed!\n\n**100% Pure** - the shampoos are based on saponified coconut oil along with glycerine and a number of extracts, oils, herbs etc, so don't qualify as no-poo but are OH poo instead. The conditioners do qualify as no-poo, and can successfully be co-washed with. They work in moderately hard water (I have no reports but mine) and remove wax and large quantities of oil from deep conditioning. They have a penetrating herbal scent that lasts at least a day. \n\nI've only seen them in my local health store and come packaged wrapped in various sizes in plastic bottles. Their website might have more packaging selections. \n\n**Eliah Sahil** - uses fullers earth and saponins combined with other additions to make a range of products. They all seem to be a powder which you measure out before your shower and then apply in the shower. They are zero waste, with paper refill packages and tins for original purchases. Reported to work nicely, but doesn't interact well with henna, stripping it off the hair. \n\n\nIf you know of any others, please post them so I can look them up and add them!",

        "body": "To respond from a ManeLine perspective:\n\nOur products work well on virtually any type of hair you can throw at it.  \n\nDyed hair will benefit from the lack of sulfates which strip the hair and color so quickly. My wife has had purple permanent dye for many years and people are amazed at how well it holds and how long it lasts. That is 100% due to our shampoo alternative, and an infrequent (1x week unless more is needed) washing routine. She routinely uses the Original blend, though we do offer a Rainbow blend which has Amla as a natural dye fixer.\n\nBleached hair will benefit from the gentleness of the blend, allowing your sebum to build back up and deal with the damage that you have from dying. One thing of note, if you have extremely porous hair, you will want to use the natural blend to reduce the darker coloring of the product.\n\nDamaged hair. This is a catchy one. Many times, damaged hair cannot be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, it needs to be cut out. There is absolutely NOTHING that will ‚Äúrepair‚Äù split ends other than scissors. That said, it is imperative to prevent further damage via sulfates while your hair repairs itself.\n\nDoes it work with hard water? Yes! I will honestly say that it is hit & miss as we have had returns from people who had hard water and experienced challenges, but in looking at them I don‚Äôt believe that the problems were necessarily with the product itself, but a combination of the hair composition and where they were at in the transition cycle.  \n\nDoes it remove oils? Yes, with caveats. You have be realistic in that it won‚Äôt wash out hard waxes, and you may need several washes and a day or two to return to a decent balance after a heavy oil treatment. We have a client who coats her hair overnight with coconut oil while bleaching, and uses our product to wash it out. She washes twice, and deals with extra oil for the next few days which works well for her as the bleach is so harsh.\n\nHow is it applied? It is a thickened liquid. The consistency of it is basically a thicker ‚Äúgravy‚Äù and it kinda looks the same as it is a natural colored product. It is applied to wet hair, exactly as traditional shampoo is.\n\nHow does it feel? The Original and Rainbow blends have some powder grit to them from Shikakai powder and/or Amla powder. This isn‚Äôt generally a big deal, and rinses well for most all people. Sidenote, we did change production for a few batches to prevent the ‚Äúgrit‚Äù and our clients were not pleased so we went back. If you have problems with the grit or you have African texture hair, you will want to use the Natural blend to avoid the grit all together.\n\nHow does it feel after your hair has dried? Upon brushing, you should find your hair to have excellent body and control without being greasy or dry.\n\nDoes it need a conditioner? In a majority of the cases, NO. However, due to continued requests from clients, we have created a conditioner which works excellent while paired with the product. The people who NEED to use the conditioner would be those with extremely long hair (mid back and longer), or those with very dry/damaged hair that needs additional moisturizing. \n\nIs it moisturizing? Yes. The aloe base to the product works excellent with your hair and scalp to moisturize the hair without leaving it greasy.\n\nIs it drying? No. It will not dry out your hair as it will not strip it down to nothing like traditional shampoos will.\n\nDoes it build up Protein? In 7 years we have not had that complaint at all.\n\nAnything else that‚Äôs relevant? A couple of things.  \n\n1 - We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. You don‚Äôt like it, I will refund you the product cost without hesitation or issue (shipping is not refunded, though we always ship at a loss to us and the cost is minimal to you).  \n\n2 - Our 16oz bottle is $24.95 which is less than half the price of some of our competitors (our pricing is being reviewed and will have to increase slightly due to ingredient and shipping increases) and our bottles last generally 3-4 months for the average user.\n\n3 - The only place you‚Äôll get our products is through us, it is simply my wife and myself who run this business 100% along with my full-time career position. We do this out of a love for creating natural things and building a community of pretty cool people. Simply put, you‚Äôre not a number or just another box to fill. We value everyone we encounter and do everything we can to make sure you are happy.\n\nAnd as always, we‚Äôre very happy to answer any questions you may have on our products or company, or the best way to make a sandwich.",

The artisan operates out of the Houston, TX area and focuses on quality ingredients and attempt to tell a story through their scents and label art. Noble Otter continues to grow as they now offer EdT‚Äôs and handmade brushes along with their soap, aftershave and bath soap. Noble Otter can be purchased direct on their website and is also available at  third party resellers like Maggard Razors (http://www.maggardrazors.com/), West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Top of the Chain (https://topofthechain.ca/).\n\nMonarch draws its inspiration from French markets. The scent imagines a walk through the market which features booths of flowers, coffee and fruits. Just outside this market is a field of lavender in full bloom. Monarch tells this story quite aptly. The accord features notes of: Lavender, Face Powder, Cognac, Coffee, Orange, Neroli, Hyacinth, Sandalwood and Vanilla. While lavender forward, this is anything but your run of the mill lavender forward scent. This is a must try for anyone who loves lavender scents. Scent strength is light to mid off the sample container and remains mid once lathered. I cannot offer any comparable fragrances because this one is quite unique. \n\nNoble Otter uses a beef tallow soap base that is in many shaver‚Äôs top ten in terms of performance. The ingredients for this base are listed as: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Avocado Oil, Lanolin, Tucuma Seed Butter, Kokum Butter, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance, Bentonite Clay, Tocopheral Acetate, Citric Acid, Watermelon Extract, Whitewillow Bark Extract, Tussah Silk.  The resulting soap base is mid-firm and loads into a damp brush very quickly. The soap is thirsty and the user is rewarded for the additional effort with a dense lather that is like cr√®me fra√Æche. The slickness is at the higher end of the slickness spectrum and I was totally comfortable buffing with no visible lather. The post shave is the star of this soap base. My skin was left feeling extremely soft and well moisturized. With all of these performance improvements, the new Noble Otter soap base gets a shavescore of 92. This places is with soap bases like Oleo Soapworks and The Sudsy Soapery (tallow).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Noble Otter Soap Co.

There is just an overwhelming array of artisans on the scene, Noble Otter just hadn't made it to my radar.  Fortunately, a fellow wet shaver gave me a heads-up regarding this limited release, and I snagged a set.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the artisan acquiesced to a small faction of followers who were pining for a dupe of Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb EdT.  While the quaint hand-drawn modification of their label intended for the unscented offering, \"Bare\", is charming, it's my understanding moves are being made to have more professional labels for future limited offerings.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, the container is a standard rigid ~~89~~ 100 mm Parkway polypropylene tub holding approximately 4 oz. of product topped with a matching threaded lid.  The satin-finish waterproof labels are straight and devoid of blemish or bubbles.  The art is crisp and the text is easy to read.  The overall design is both classy and whimsical, the focal point of which obviously being the austere otter.  In the regular offerings, the otter's attire is reportedly indicative of the respective fragrance.  Perhaps it's been done elsewhere, but this aspect is reminiscent of Zoologist's scheme.  My only critique would be that the actual Noble Otter brand name and stylized logo is small and somewhat difficult to feature in a SOTD photograph unless one employs a macro shot.  Of course, the understated text is probably by-design in keeping with the formal presentation.  The aftershave splash is the standard 4 oz. glass amber apothecary bottle with ribbed threaded black lid that was secured with a break-away safety seal.\n\nOff the tub, the scent strength is quite light, but it essentially doubles (I refuse to say \"explodes\") upon lathering, opening with a fresh spicy clean resin topped by a lemony citrus enveloped by a rounded floral that stops just short of rose.  The fragrance warms up with time revealing a leathery tobacco with wisps of cinnamon, never becoming heavy.  The paired splash presents similarly, but certainly sharper bergamot in the opening.  The spiciness is more distinct in the splash, and this phase obviously lasts longer before warming up.  The leather and tobacco, while still present in the splash's dry down aren't as easily separated suggesting a skilled blending.  After about three hours, I begin to lose the fragrance just as the cinnamon steps in.  There is also a final smoky sweetness in the vanilla realm.  I think I went nose blind at the four-hour mark because I could no longer detect it, but my wife did. \n\nI have no experience with target fragrance, so I can't speak to the accuracy.  I did, however find it to be pleasant enough that I'm entertaining the thought of picking up a bottle of the Spicebomb EdT or the \"Extreme\" variant EdP.  My limited research suggests the two versions do differ in more than strength, so if someone can tell me which fragrance more closely matches Kaboom!, I'd appreciate it.\n\nIn terms of performance, if not for the thirst, this beef tallow base could pass for a Talbot shaving creation, loading and lathering in a very similar nature.  Noble Otter functions with moderate hydration, yielding a voluminous thick lather similar to high-butter vegan bases like that of PAA's Crown King base.  However, if you stop here, there is a bit of spackling which is a good indicator that more water will optimize it.  Prior to the shave, test palm lathers proved this base can handle a fair bit of water thereby achieving elite levels of slickness, so I proceeded to push the water for the head and face lathering.  Slickness is competitive with any soap I've tried.  Residual slickness takes that up a notch more such that long sweeping scalp passes were easily obtained on residual slickness alone.  Being a shower shaver, I'm less concerned with where the lather falls, but with this kind of slickness, my carelessness made the all metal Schick injector a little precarious to hold on to.  This is incredible slickness despite my hard water.\n\nThe post shave is also similar to Talbot's and Catie's Bubbles' jojoba bases.  That is to say, the post shave is spectacular, requiring no post-product whatsoever. Thus the splash was simply about continuing the experience.  I was surprised with how the splash was distributed.  Using only a couple in my palm to spread on my dome and face, my hand glided as if the splash were mostly oil.  I anticipated at least some degree of greasiness, but instead, it soaked right in leaving a silky smooth, natural feel.  I searched the ingredients for something like glycerin, but it's not there.  This surprising slickness could be attributed to reconstitution of the soap base, but I thoroughly rinse in the shower and towel dry before I apply aftershave, so I fine that to be unlikely.\n\nUltimately, this was a perfect shave both in terms of enjoyable fragrance and high-level performance.\n\n*DISCLOSURE:  I purchased the aforementioned products for retail price directly from the artisan's web site.  I received no gifts or other incentives in return for my comments.*\n\nSOAP INGREDIENTS: stearic acid, beef tallow, coconut milk, aloe vera, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, castor oil, coconut oil, avocado oil, lanolin, tucuma seed butter, kokum butter, sodium hydroxide, bentonite clay, tocopheral acetate, citric acid, watermelon extract, whitewillow bark extract, tussah silk.*\n\nAFTERSHAVE INGREDIENTS:  denatured alcohol, witch hazel, water, sodium lactate, panthenol, carrot extract, chamomile extract, seaweed extract.*\n\n*Fragrance is an assumed ingredient. As previously stated, the labels are from the \"Bare\" unscented variety and have been modified by hand to accommodate this limited fragrance.\n\nBONUS PIC:  https://i.imgur.com/cMRQNYR.jpg",

Released on March 21, 2019, Dark Two looks to refine the original masterpiece. The relaunch appears to be the first, of what could be future relaunches, in limited edition fashion, of the original Tallow + Steel scents. Tallow + Steel continues to use the highest quality ingredients and continues their charitable donation with each scent release.\n\nDark Two, while similar to the original Dark aims to refine the scent. Scent notes are listed as: Coffee, Benzoin, Vetiver, Cocoa, Ginger and Peppermint. By utilizing Haitian Vetiver and reducing the amount of peppermint, the scent is immediately less gourmand than its predecessor. It opens dark and semi-sweet from the cocoa and vetiver, before more vetiver and coffee add a smokiness. The resinous benzoin plays backbone to this scent while the ginger and peppermint add a hint of spiciness. This is indeed a refinement in what was already a masterpiece class scent. I loved the original Dark and Dark Two is even nicer. Mrs. Ruds approves this for casual use, which was quite a surprise to me. Scent strength is mid-strong off the container and remains as such once lathered. \n\nTallow + Steel‚Äôs Version 3 is a tallow based soap. ingredients are listed as: Stearic Acid, Water, Organic Argan Oil, Organic Glycerin, Essential Oils, Organic Castor Oil, Organic Safflower Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Tallow (Pasture-Raised), Organic Coconut Oil, Bentonite Clay, Sodium Hydroxide, Vitamin E, Silk. In my experience, the soap loads effortlessly into the brush and lathering is a breeze. The thirst of the soap is right where you‚Äôd expect based on its ingredients and when properly dialed in feels like sour cream in consistency. The slickness and residual slickness stand very close to the top of the spectrum and provide excellent glide. The post shave is excellent and also near the top of the spectrum.. My skin is left feeling soft and smooth with no need for a post shave. Having spent more time with Tallow + Steel of late, I have found that it performs closer to the top of the of the spectrum and have therefore given it a bump. The revised ShaveScore for T+S Version 3 is a 94. For similar performing soap bases, I suggest: Australian Private Reserve and Noble Otter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Tallow + Steel Dark Two (promotional gift)\n* Brush - Mocek ‚ÄúCalypso‚Äù (purchased)\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Tallow + Steel Dark Two (promotional gift) ",

So far has a strong predominate blueberry flavor with a subtle orange and vanilla profile. Curious to see with age how the mesquite honey comes through on the profile. \n\nI‚Äôm shocked on the clarity, have never gotten a fruit mead so clear before. Bentonite and pectic enzyme work absolute wonders. ",

    "body": "Just got into this hobby! There‚Äôs a Meadery near me I enjoy visiting but I‚Äôve struggled to rationalize $25 price on 375ml bottles. I‚Äôll frequently visit for tastings and to support their business but wanted to attempt my own brews for more casual drinks and for celebrating this upcoming holiday season.\n\nI had four batches in mind, and got started with one gallon jars for each to try different flavors. I purchased all of my brewing supplies off of Amazon, and all of my raw ingredients came from Costco or Kroger. All of my honey was Kirkland Meadowflower in 5 pound containers, and my yeast was all EC-1118.\n\nMy first vessel contains 5 squeezed and zested lemons, 2 pounds of raspberries and about 3 pounds of honey (lemon berry supreme). It ended up fermenting to nearly 19-20% by the hydrometer readings, and I diluted it to about 18%. It has a very floral taste, and will likely age well. I back-sweetened with about 4 oz of honey.\n\nMy second batch was about 6 zested and juiced limes, around 2 pounds of blackberries, and around 3 pounds of honey (blackberry chungus). Finished around 18% ABV, and diluted to around 16%. It has a bramble taste, similar to just barely ripened berries, and less jammy than I was expecting.\n\nMy third batch was the peach pancake brew, with 5 whole peaches sliced and around 2 pounds of honey. I also included just over a pound of maple syrup. This by far had the largest alcohol content, finishing nearly at 21%. The taste was great - with warm peach flavors and an almost toasty vanilla flavor from the syrup. The peaches took up so much volume I ended up diluting to about 15%, but this improved the drinkability significantly. This was by far my favorite flavor so far, and will be great this winter.\n\nMy last batch was made of 5 cosmic apples, 3 pounds of honey, 2 star anise, 2 cinnamon sticks, and 5 cloves. It finished around 18% ABV, but again due to the volume of the apples it was diluted to nearly 12%.  The taste is very mellow at the moment. It‚Äôs similar to traditional meads I‚Äôve had with hints of apple, and the cinnamon sticks in primary ended up giving an earthy almost oaky flavor. It‚Äôs definitely not what I was expecting which was more ‚Äúcider-y‚Äù, but it is still very pleasant, and I think will get better with time. I did back-sweeten with about 6 oz of brown sugar.\n\nEach of these batches was in primary for between 3 and 8 weeks, and was reracked with Potassium Sorbate, Camden tablets, sparkolloid, and bentonite clay. It was nearly crystal clear after a week, and I was able to bottle with little sediment entering the bottles (with the exception of peach pancake, that one was a little more volatile).\n\nEach of the labels (obligatory ‚Äúim not an artist‚Äù) I made in Microsoft paint and printed on label paper. I ended up kinda liking the janky look.",

I it was horrible, I could just toss it and move on, and if it was good then I got a deal on some cheap soap.\n\nThe scent notes for Matsuyama from the Web site are \"Mandrin rind, geranium, light musk\" and the ingredients are \"home rendered tallow, stearic acid, coconut oil, castor oil, shea butter, vegetable glycerin, coconut milk, bentonite clay and fragrance.\"\n\nIt's a softish soap (a \"croap\" I guess some call it), so was easy to smush into a 3\" plastic tub and use today. The results were good, like really good. The mandaran orange scent was front and center - the other notes were there, but just as backup.  It lathered up quickly, took about the right amount of water, and provided the slickness and protection that I'd expect from a shave soap.  I look forward to trying the Cypress and Jakarta (sandalwood) soon.\n\nü™í Many Happy Shaves! ü™í",

    "body": "\n\nMy History (very long- skip to ‚ÄúSOLUTION‚Äù if you dont care to read although i spent two hours writing and correcting for you all to hopefully help)\n\nAs someone who has bb i believe caused from kissing, sinus, lungs possibly, gerd, constipation, thyroid hormone imbalance, yeast, throat/chest infections, old dental work, now im thinking my gut health and my gingivitis on the roof of my mouth only according to my dentist and high sugar/carb diet also dehydration due to less water intake from overactive bladder let me tell you some of my history‚Ä¶\n\nGrowing up my breath was normal occasional sinus breath or breath you get when your sick nothing major. I could talk around people no issues. Around my teens years i got into a relationship this relationship lasted several years over a decade. My partner didnt take oral health serious never saw a dentist ect. Over the course of our relationship they had several broken and or infected teeth. Because i loved them i stayed and tried to convince them to see a dentist and other things for their oral health. They would comment on my breath and make jokes but i didnt think it was that bad or they were serious until other people said things. Our most memorable argument via text included me saying ‚Äúyea i didnt have that bb problem until i met you‚Äù his mom even watched me in the bathroom once and said ‚Äúlet me see how you brush, no thats not how you do it‚Äù as if she couldnt smell her sons. IuMy grandmother said ‚Äúim going to get you an electric brush‚Äù and ‚Äúsome ppl just have bb no matter how shiny their teeth are‚Äù kids at daycare would say things like ‚Äúmy mommy brushes her teeth‚Äù my neices and nephews slowly went from being on me a few years ago to speaking beside me or wanting to play games where we would ‚Äúbrush our teeth‚Äù. So After seeing my Partner wasnt phased by his bb and it started to make mine bad I stopped  kissing him all together or eating and sharing things not even a peck or a bite but it was too late my breath mimicked his or even worse though my teeth werent rotten. The time he did see a dentist they wanted to pull 14 teeth! No saving! Bleeding gums, broken teeth, bad breath he had the whole 9 yards so of course he didnt go back. Even developed bouts of throwing up i guess from ulcers or the bacteria growth in his system. My guess is his bacteria entered my sinus cavity and my chest and wreaked havoc over the years. I often can smell the stench in my nose When laying down only. This is why i believe my bb is coming from my gut now too possibly hpylori and possibly deeply rooted in my gum line and under old fillings. I had my tonsils removed during our relationship but i swear my breath smelled better when i had them but i stayed sick so they had to go. Had wisdoms out too. I broke things off with him over two years ago but the bb just got worse since then after meeting more men i kissed.I met other men and probably picked up some of their bacteria too from kissing thats not helping my situation either because i noticed my breath smell changed after kisssing the first guy after my ex. His breath was bad up close but not enough to fill a room or small areas. Month into our dating mine went from subtly bad to strange bad smell. I guess for years my Mouth was use to that one man so introducing new bacteria from kissing and sex made my mouth run rampant. We were on a date face to fsce after about 5 month of talking and for the first time he covered his nose somewhat, i stopped talking so embarrased. Months later I met another guy we never kissed but we had a serious face to face convo and he held his hand over his nose in the same manner as the man before him. This began my turning my head sideways to talk phase. All these men had the same reaction i stopped wanting to date but i attract people so i got confident and tried again. This third guy i Tried to say something playfully to him after we had been drinking he said ‚Äúnot right now my breath is weird dont you think?‚Äù as his  head was down in his hands i was drunk but i knew the comment was about my breath. Though after that i was prepared to be a nun or at least find someone who cant smell that well, i allowed 1 last guy i met out of country to pursue me because vacay love is fun right?! The first day we met he asked me something. This day i could taste my breath was bad after eating and jetlag but i spoke anyway he moved from in front of me and over to the person next to me and talked to them and me from a distance. After that day he never made any sign that my breath was bad or either he weighed his options but other ppl on the trip kind of did they wouldn‚Äôt get too close or would make the faces im used to when its bad. But one night he and I we were close and i spoke and he literally shook his head like a dog to get the smell out his nostrils. Safe to say i stopped talking and listened more the rest of the trip. He also claimed he ran out of toothpaste 1 day and needed to use mine i had a brand new tube i presented to him for his protection. i bet he thought from then i don‚Äôt brush my teeth lol. One other night we were close and he said ‚Äúim goin to go brush my teeth‚Äù i said i dont smell anything just food he said ‚Äúits my biggest insecurity so let me go‚Äù i think he smelled mine and wanted me to go brush mine but the kicker is i had already done it. Every night for years i have been flossing and brushing mouthwash. Seems my breath was better when i didnt tbh. Anyways after we had been kissing for some days i could smell how i imagine my breath smells on him. Mind you he is a vegan, eats clean barely used commercial products but somehow my bacteria jumped into his mouth and was now coming out when he spoke. I never smelled anything other than fish on this man if he had any that day He was the last person i allowed in my personal space i dont plan to date until this is under control. Also my family member i roomed with on this same trip used one of my oral products a week into the trip and the reason i know is because he asked to borrow deodorant i left my stuff out daily so i know he used my paste too and sadly i smelled the bb on him he was fine until  obviously using my mouth wash or toothpaste. I saw him three weeks later and the smell was on him heavily when he talked or just breathed. I was saddened! I dont want to keep passing this curse around especially if it sticks to them and doesn‚Äôt leave or their body cant fight it .Its too embarrassing.I barely date now or talk to people face on because i can see them cover their noses or have reactions. Even my Bestfriend who also had bb but i dnt smell it any more these days pinches his nose when im not looking. I recently had a surgery and they gave me an antibiotic via iv. Upon waking im high as a kite but i managed to say ‚Äúdo you all know a good Gi doc i can see for my bad breath?‚Äù Thats how much this hunts me daily my thoughts about  it have consumed me. Also i think the intro of the antibiotic made me smell worse.  Ppl seem to be able to smell my\nBreath at a 3 ft distance when you used to have to get kind of close from what i coukd tell. After this surgery ppl have been dodging me left n right. Im googling stuff every night. Even the demons in my dreams pinch their noses to taunt me. My 3yo Neice literally puts her whole arm over her face to be sheilded from my breath after asking me anything. She often says ‚Äúwhats that smell?‚Äù After i speak. I love her but im happy when she goes back home because of her new comments these past 3 months since my surgery and seeing her. In the past when kids ate after me their breath would begin to smell for a while too then go away  i stopped allowing them to eat after me once i realized so I def have some bacterial thing going on too. Now my mom even does suttle hand motions over her nose when i speak in the car. Looking back Friends at work always offered me gum or bought me a personal pack, my uncle asked once ‚Äúyou use an electric toothbrush right?‚Äù even asked what dentist i went to i think to check if i even saw one. All these instances has prompted me to stop reading reddit posts and post here to maybe help others because i know how bad this can feel. You isolate, you dont date, you stay away from kids and crowds, youre probably still wearing a mask though covid is somewhat over i know i do sometimes. Its miserable i know ü•≤. Those of you with spouse are lucky. I only trusted asking is my breath bad to my ex who i got it from. Careful who you kiss!  One last note.. my dad visited recently and i remebered for as long as i can recall he has had bb sinus related my brother had somewhat too but people still talk to him in his face but my mom did mention about my dads back when they were dating and once how bad my brothers was and her wanting to talk to him about it. This was before mine got this bad. Id say i have the worse of three of us because ppl literally find a way to swipe their nose slyly or cover their face they don‚Äôt do that with my dad or bro. so im not sure if its the way our sinuses are set up but we all have sinus problems, overbites,teeth grinders, mouth breathing at night and i have TMJ so bad i was supposed to have my jaw broken as a child to correct my bite but my mother didnt want that. Worst of all since my tonsillectomy years ago i cant smell that well so i have to base how bad my breath is off peoples reactions or when i get in the shower i blow my breath into a hot rag and i can smell it from steam. Anyways ive been praying about it and i had a revelation to stop the fluoride so heres my solution so far that has gotten me zero bb reactions this week and confidence to talk without pretending to bite my nails or looking down and around not facing people. Last i saw my bestie i didn‚Äôt see him pinch his nose and he  even asked today what dentist i see because he probably believes he has bad breath still from me putting my hands to my face when he talks but its to shield him from my own breath when i get ready to respond not vice versa. In my mind he wants to be seen by my dentist because whoever got mine under control surely can help him so he thinks lol. Also i noticed i can smell now, no drainage and pollen isnt bothering me. My chest feels clear of mucus too! Its been a week and a half doing this. My teeth are whiter a brown spot i had is almost\nGone, and my mouth tasted different too. Also guys drink water and do try to eat more fruits and veggies. \n\n*****SOLUTION*****\n\nNO commercial Toothpaste or Mouthwash at all!!!\n\nI know i know i found comfort in the foamy action and minty taste of toothe paste but over the years i guess as my oral biome worsened id have so much thick nasty mucus in the back of my throat after using toothpaste. It was drying me out the over production of phlegm and saliva never clicked until recent.  That also held smell. One use of this concotion and my thick mucus after brushing nearly disappeared.\n\nStep1. swish mouth with water and tiny bit of 3% hydrogen peroxide at least 30 seconds\n\nStep2.  Floss nightly! Not optional! Youtube ‚Äúcorrect way to floss‚Äù.Many of us are not doing the c shape into the gumline which is important. It will be sore at first but keep going. \n\nStep3. Use one tsp organic unrefined coconut oil to oil pull while you take your nightly shower or during a tv show. Aim for 10 minute then work way to 15 especially in the beginning of doing this routine until your oral biome is improving. Spit into the trash can not your drains it will clog!\n\nStep4. Rinse mouth with water and scrape tongue untill clear\n\nStep5. Id get an electric toothbrush but manual is fine if you are diligent with getting teeth, tongue,cheeks roof of mouth, close as you can to throat too. Brush with this tooth powder mixture below:\n\n-Bentonite clay\n-Cinnamon\n-Xylitol\n-Baking soda\nAdd 1 drop of peppermint or spearmint essential oil to the top of this if you need and miss the minty clean feel\n\n(Sorry didnt measure but use baking soda the least of all ingredients- i mixed everything with a plastic spoon dont use metal and added to a 4 oz glass jar- wet your brush dip in powder and procede to brush at least two minutes. You dont have to scrub but focus on the gumline gum damage from scrubbing can cause bb too! Add water to your mouth after brushing and swish and gargle the paste a bit before spitting out \n\nStep6. Lastly swish mouth and throat with this solution. Make more as needed. Last about a week. In an 8oz jar i added:\n\n\n5 cloves cracked\n1tsp salt\n1-2 tsp Xylitol\n5 drops Pepermint oil\n5 drops clove oil\nSprinkle probiotic (your choice- pop the capsule open and sprinkle some)\nDrop of chylorophyll\nOne mint tea bag\nOne green tea bag\n\nLeave everything. In the jar and use this 2x a day. When you wake up only brush your teeth with the powder and follow up with the natural mouthwash. At night do the oil pulling. Find a good probiotic to take daily too. Hope this can help someone\n \n",

The husband (Kyle - u/rocketk455) and wife (April) team also offers bath soap and aftershave to accompany their shaving soap offering. The duo is committed to small batch handmade soaping and when they are not soaping, they both work professionally in education. Summer Break recently overhauled their website, had a new logo designed and has reformulated both their soap base and aftershave offerings. The updated base will be available on April 3, 2019 direct from Summer Break and also at Maggard Razors ([www.maggardrazors.com](http://www.maggardrazors.com/)).\n\nField Day intends to remind the user of an early spring morning. The scent is designed to open grassy and slightly floral before the smells of water and earth come into play. Scent notes feature Grass, Damp Earth, Iris, Aldehydes, Cedar and Aqua. To my nose, the scent unfolds as it was designed to. Grass dominates the opening before damp earth and smoky cedar round the scent out. This scent definitely captures the idea behind it and I like it a lot. As you‚Äôve probably guessed, this one is not Mrs. Ruds approved however. Strength of scent on this one is mid-strong out of the container and remains through the shave. \n\nSummer Break‚Äôs latest soap base is still tallow based and features the following ingredients list: Stearic Acid, Beef Tallow, Glycerin, Coconut Milk, Aloe Vera Liquid, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Shea Butter, Grapeseed Oil, Coconut Oil, Sunflower Oil, Kokum Butter, Yogurt Powder, Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Fragrance/Essential Oil, Lanolin, Jojoba Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate and Bentonite Clay. The soap is in the middle of the firmness spectrum and is a quick and easy loading soap. It has a nice hydration range but is not overly thirsty to the point of being cumbersome. When dialed in the lather shares a similar consistency to sour cream. Slickness is excellent in terms of primary slickness and in terms of residual slickness, this plays with the elite. Post shave is vastly improved with this reformulation. This post shave is excellent. It hydrates the skin well and leaves a soft supple feeling after the rinse. Summer Break has made noticeable improvements with this soap base, color me impressed. The ShaveScore for Summer Breaks soap base is now a 93. Similar performing soap bases are: Grooming Dept (duck fat) and Murphy & McNeil (tallow).\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.*** \n\n* Soap - Summer Break Soaps Field Day (promotional gift)\n* Brush -‚Äã ‚ÄãEver Ready 200 w/ 24mm Maggard SHD (gift)\n* Razor - Blackland Razors Vector (gift) \n* Post - Summer Break Soaps Field Day (promotional gift)",

    "body": "**SITUATION**¬†\n\nI was diagnosed with Candida Glabrata and BV in November 2023 and have spent 7 months doing everything I can to fight these infections. Contrary to the normal symptoms, my main symptom was extreme watery discharge that¬†would constantly pour out of me. I went through 7-10 pads a day. Every. Single. Day. It was absolutely miserable and I was constantly running to the¬†bathroom to clean myself up. Glabrata affected my daily life tremendously and made sex with my husband non-existent. I was extremely frustrated and hopeless, and felt like I tried every possible treatment. My BV would go away with antibiotics but come back a few weeks later. My Dr's tried so hard to help but they had never encountered someone with my particular yeast strain, and were frustrated that¬†antibiotics weren't clearing the¬†BV infection. They even contacted the CDC to see what trials and possible medications could help. Glabrata and BV produce a protective film called a biofilm. It prevents medications from penetrating the infections, thus allowing them to multiply and thrive.\n\nI was about to give up and just accept that I will have this for the rest of my life when suddenly I felt like myself again.\n\n¬†**MY HEALTH PROFILE**\n\n* Female \n* Not diabetic.\n* No birth control.\n* No vitamin deficiencies\n* One sexual partner for the last 13 years.\n* Followed Candida Diet for several months. No gluten, dairy, sugar (including fruits), or alcohol. Didn't notice any improvement in symptoms. Very health conscious¬†eater in general.\n* First lab test confirmed Yeast and BV. Tried traditional yeast infection medications and when all of those failed we went with a more¬†specialized test. Those lab tests confirmed Glabrata twice. Latest test confirmed Glabrata with BV again. Negative on all STDs.\n* Was on several antibiotics for various infections that caused all this.\n\n**FAILED TREATMENTS**\n\n* 6 rounds of Fluconazole.¬†\n* 2 rounds of Flagyl antibiotics.¬†\n* Clotrimazole 2% cream for 5 nights.¬†\n* Metronidazole 0.75% gel for 7 nights.\n* Terconazole 0.4% cream for 7 nights.\n* 600mg of Boric Acid (could only tolerate a couple nights due to extreme burning and irritation).\n* Coconut oil, Oregano oil, Tea tree oil suppositories for 14 days.¬†\n* Months of seeing a functional medicine practitioner, spending $400/month on biofilm busters and various supplements.\n* Oregano oil taken orally.\n* 1200mg of raw organic Garlic taken 2x/day for 7 days.\n* Sacchromyces Boulardi (5B) taken orally for 4 months, along with an additional multistrain 30B Probiotic supplement.\n* Baking soda suppositories.\n* Douches with ACV (apple cider vinegar).\n* Sitz baths with Baking soda and ACV.\n* 14 days of drinking Bentonite Clay.¬†\n* 14 day treatment of 16% Flucytosine cream. (This was expensive! $300, and didn't work) Tested positive for BV again in addition to Glabrata after using this.\n\n**TREATMENTS THAT WORKED FOR ME:**\n\n**First**¬†I treated the yeast with:\n\n* 600mg Boric acid inserted vaginally for 21 days. (I decided to give this a try again and just deal with the burning and irritation bc my dr's couldn't help anymore).\n\n**After**¬†21 days of using boric acid the BV symptoms were extreme and still present so I did:\n\n* 7 days of vaginal douches with 1/2 distilled water and half 3% hydrogen peroxide.\n* Flora Power vaginal probiotic each night after HP douche for 5 nights, then alternate nights of suppositories between Jarrow Femdophilus 5B probiotic (2 pills) and Physioflor probiotic (1 pill). I use the ones that say for oral use as vaginal suppositories (taking orally did nothing for me). I did this consistently for a few weeks.\n\nThroughout the months of misery I am sad to say that I am incredibly disappointed in the conventional approach to healthcare in this country and cannot believe I found a solution online in Reddit posts. For everyone suffering through the isolating¬†experience of Glabrata and BV don't give up! Feel free to message me with any questions.¬†Special thank you to the following authors of the below reddit posts. You helped me at a time when I didn't have much hope left.",
