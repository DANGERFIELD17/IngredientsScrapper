    "body": "Hi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.\n\n* [**RealBarrier's Extreme Cream**](http://www.atopalmglobal.com/product/proDetail.asp?brand=3&cate=332&Pcate=217&Mcate=) \\#3 Top Creams (4.11/5 out of 6,153 Reviews) **fragranced**  [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/REAL-BARRIER-Extreme-Cream-50ml-BEST-Korea-Cosmetic/312419244657?epid=1740451843&hash=item48bda35a71:g:Kp4AAOSwoEFcM~bo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Aestura Ato Barrier Cream**](https://www.aestura.com/web/product/view.do?prdSeq=1004)  \\#6 Top Creams (4.23/5 out of 2,524 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Mamonde's Moisture Ceramide Intense Cream**](https://www.mamonde.com/int/en/product/ceramide-intense-cream.html) \\#15 Top Creams (3.94/5 out of 2,840 Reviews) **fragranced**    [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/MAMONDE-Ceramide-Intense-Cream-50ml/392296451084?epid=8032468017&hash=item5b56b0cc0c%3Ag%3A9wMAAOSwMMNc2mEr&LH_BIN=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Intensive Cream**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=281) (4.21/5 out of 1,539 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Zeroid's Soothing Cream** (4.12/5 out of 1,768 Reviews)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Zeroid's Richenic Cream Urea 5%**](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284) **-** not many reviews as this is new, but FANTASTIC ingredients.

It doesn't bother her skin, and really helps calm her skin & works well under makeup. She also highly recommends the soothing gel for summer & concentrate cream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** (4.20/5 out of 3,162 Reviews)\n\n[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ILLIYOON-Ceramide-Ato-Concentrate-Cream-200ml/132526755796)\n\n[Apmall](http://global.amorepacificmall.com/en/shop/pr/illiyoon/P000006418/shop_product_view.do?i_sProductcd=P000006418)\n\n[Mini-review by Dr. Dray @ 13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1X4RmFTJQ8&t=877s)\n\nThis cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the \"scrubby bits\" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.\n\nWhile Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**\n\n>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.\n\n[Triderma Eczema Fast Healing Face % Body Cream](https://www.walmart.com/ip/TriDerma-MD-Eczema-Fast-Healing-Face-and-Body-Lotion-with-Bonus-Tube-4-2-oz/21656991)\\- not sure %, but it looks pretty high. I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time. It's really thick and is really tacky on my face. It doesn't have a \\~nice sillicone-y feel\\~. It absorbs all the way by morning tho when I slug life with it.

I mean, we all end up testing things with our faces and just trying to hold down the confirmation bias. It's good to know where else to turn. But patented just means proprietary to me, and I've learned to distrust that in skincare. It's a lot like a \"you don't need to know\" and a head pat. It's nice to see some positive reviews here, especially from people experienced with more than one of the above products - but it's not like we can't find a billion glowing reviews of Cerave, either.",

Not to mention you can easily get 200ml tube for $15 and that's a good deal. The capsules inside confused me at first tho lol. Apart from that, that cream can be boring for some, but it worked for me in -15°C winter days and saved my face, that's a feat. I sometimes go ham on the amount I put on my face tho, and I wouldn't recommend that. It's not an oily cream but you can feel when you go overboard.",

Personal reviews can be very helpful, but after seeing my billionth \"OMG L-AA worked for me overnight!\" review (no, it almost certainly didn't, it was more likely something else in the product like a humectant or emollient), I've learned to take them with a grain of salt.\n\nI found [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4799034/) but quick Googling isn't finding much else that isn't related to atopic dermatitis, though I'm on mobile so my Google skills are limited at the moment.\n\nEdit: Also, I know this is the AB sub but since OP brought up Eucerin, Eucerin has an **Roughness Relief Lotion** that is *possibly* 10% urea. The ingredients for the lotion are (or at least were last time I checked) identical to their UreaRepair PLUS 10% Urea Lotion. I asked Eucerin if they could confirm the percentage of the RRL, but they declined, saying they only disclose what they legally have to. **Udderly Smooth** also makes products with urea, including at 10% and 20%. At the moment I use the Eucerin Advanced Repair on my face daily, but use the Udderly Smooth Extra Care Cream (with 10%) in the cooler months. I use the Roughness Relief on my body (I have KP on my arms and legs, and urea's been *immensely* helpful for it), but found it *way* too greasy for my face. (Again, though, that's a personal review, so YMMV.)\n\n(Edit 2: Realized I need more coffee, got Eucerin's Intensive Repair, Advanced Repair, and Roughness Relief mixed up in my head. Fixed now.)",

I'm a bit skeptical given the almost industry-wide practice of not putting enough ceramides in OTC skincare products.  Also, without seeing the studies we really don't know what they're claiming the patented ceramide complexes do as far as barrier repair or how they actually performed (or if the testing was even valid/non-biased).",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5–3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

I sure hope people are buying it so it doesn't get discontinued. I got it for maybe 6000 KRW for the 50 ml tube and it's such a nice moisturizing vehicle with Tinosorb S and Uvinul A Plus. So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "**TRETINOIN ADVICE**\n\nSome tips from my personal experience with Tretinoin Microsphere. \n\n1. Introduce Tretinoin during winter. (Tretinoin takes the top layer off, which protects us from the sun)\n1. Climatise your skin with retinol before you start on Tretinoin.\n1. Use a mild cleanser, wash your face gently. \n1. Avoid wash cloth, facial scrubs, astringents or any product that will irritate the skin eg actives like LAA, AHA, BHA.\n1. Do not apply immediately after washing your face. Wait 20minutes \n1. The face must be cleansed and completely dry in order for Tretinoin to work properly.  Having water on the surface of your face will prevent it from settling properly.\n1. You may mix Tretinoin with other skin serums if you are experiencing sensitivity.\n1. Start low (eg 0.025) to ensure your skin can adapt to its effects. Building your tolerance will create better results. Before you go to the next level, make sure you use up at least 1 whole tube and have no more redness/peeling before you get a stronger dosage.\n1. Try to use the Tretinoin every night even if you need to dilute it. Using it daily helps you to acclimate better and faster to it. If i stop for a week, it takes me a couple of weeks to get acclimatised to Tretinoin again.\n1. Apply a pea size of Tretinoin to your forehead , cheeks, nose & chin. You may want to avoid applying to sensitive areas like the corners of your mouth, eyes and nose. \n1. No need to use more than pea sized, Dr Frances Prenna Jones teaches how to use a \"chickpea\" size on this [video](https://youtu.be/RMHG3K5x_WE), fast forward to 16:23. She says \"MORE is not MORE\" lol\n1. Begin by applying every other night. After 2 weeks, if there is no redness or irritation, increase application to every night. If you develop redness or irritation, continue at every other night or decrease to twice weekly.\n1. After applying tretinoin, practise wait time of 20min-1 hour before applying your other serums/moisturisers for maximum benefits from Tretinoin.  \n1. When reintroducing Tretinoin into your routine after a long break or perhaps for the Tretinoin virgins, use your AHA/BHA in the day and Tretinoin at night. If you use both together, it may be too irritating for the skin.\n1. Gel is more potent than cream version. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pigmentation/comments/5acyqx/tretinoin_retinol_retina_differin_adapalene/d9o4wyy/)\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol  could give you a red, rosy hue to the skin as Retinoic acid increases capillary aborisation in the dermis. You may want to get a colour correcting primer to use before you apply your foundation. It could either be green/yellow based.\n1. Apply Tretinoin in the night only. No exceptions. Do not use in the day. Tretinoin is light sensitive.\n1. Tretinoin / Retinol will increase your photosensitivity, sunscreen is mandatory. Do not start Tretinoin if you do not intend to use sunscreen.\n1. Please use a mineral based sunscreen and wear a broad rim hat. Mineral based sunscreen will better block the sun harmful rays and are less likely to irritate the skin unlike sunscreen chemicals. Lack of sun protection can lead to easily burned skin.\n1. Less is more with Tretinoin.\n1. Continued use is key, as it takes some time to take effect.\n1. Ensure you hydrate hydrate hydrate.\n - Basically you just pile it on your moisturiser. I was using multiple serums and multiple creams and finished off with an occlusive every night... while your skin is adjusting to Tretinoin, the acid mantle may be broken and you'll suffer from TEWL big time...\n - In the day... get a mist.. and topup... good over makeup/sunscreen. Perhaps you can use a silcone primer as a kind of occlusive to prevent TEWL. Make sure you topup your sunscreen as Tretinoin makes you uber sun sensitive!\n1. Finish the routine with an occlusive if necessary.\n\n\n* DO NOT USE if pregnant or if you are planning for a baby (applies to females only).\n\n***\n\n[Transepidermal Water Loss \\(TEWL\\)](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32109-2_32) \n\n\n***\n\n**MOISTURE UP - best advice for tretinoin users**\n\nWith moisturisers.. make sure you use all 3 types. This youtube video can explain a lil http://youtu.be/QdNPiW4ZULk \n\n* Occlusives - you want only 1 layer, this is used LAST\n* Emollients -  creams, ointments, lotions and gels. \n* Humectants - as many layers as possible, water based.\n\nYMMV of course.\n\n***\n\nBasically i divide it into 3 categories since the above 3 categories can sometimes overlap\n\n* Water based\n* Non Water based including oils and butters\n* Occlusive\n\n**Tips**\n\n* You want lots and lots of water based moisturisers that are skin identical, water-binding, humectants.\n* Limit the oil based ingredients to 1 not too oily.\n* Unlimited from the water based category. \n* Use the Occlusive last and a thin layer will suffice.\n \n***\n\n#**Ingredients to look out for include:**\n\n**Water based**\n\nMy personal fave are Sodium Hyaluronate and Sodium PCA (similar to Hyaluronic Acid)\nWater binding agents / NMF Natural moisturising factors\n\n* Hyaluronic Acid (HA)\n* Centella asiatica (Gotu Kola)\n* Ceramides\n* DMAE Dimethylaminoethanol / DMAE Bitartrate\n* Genistein\n* Beta Glucan\n* Glycerin\n* Ceramides\n* Lecithin\n* Polysaccharides\n* Hyaluronic Acid\n* Sodim Hyaluronate\n* Sodium PCA\n* Collagen\n* Elastin\n* Proteins\n* Amino Acid\n* Cholesterol\n* Glucose\n* Sucrose\n* Fructose\n* Glycogen\n* Phospholipids\n* Glycosphingolipids\n* Glycosaminoglycan\n* Allantoin helps to improve the water content of the epidermis\n* Panthenol Vitamin B5\n\n***\n\n**Oil based:**\n\nAdd a facial oil but no more than 1 as you don't want to get too oily\n\n* i noticed a lot of people using rosehip oil. I don't think it is a good option as rosehip contains betacarotene and perhaps trace amounts of trans-retinoic acid. If you are using Tretinoin, you don't need any more vitamin A. * Perhaps choose a different facial oil that is more suitable for your skin type. \n * Plenty of Oleic acid for dry skin types and \n * Lots of Linoleic Acid for oily/acne prone skin as the skin is deficient in that Omega 6 fatty acid.\n* Check out [Gothamista's guide to facial oils](https://youtu.be/R1TZwTDlzw4)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Occlusives**\n\nVaseline has the highest occlusive factor but i prefer the more natural versions instead of petroleum based alternatives.\n\n* Natural versions\n * Squalane / Squalene\n * Lecithin\n * Cocoa butter, Mango and Shea butter: Careful only Shea butter is non comedogenic\n * Coconut oil - comedogenic rating 4\n * Beeswax is a wonderful occlusive ingredient, especially for dry, chapped lip\n * Lanolin -It is a wax not fat secreted by sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Used for its protective and barrier properties.\n\n* Petroleum by products\n * Mineral Oil\n * Isoparaffin\n * Polybutene\n * Synthetic petrol chemical derived ingredients (they give a long term occlusion of the skin,  prevents the skin from recognising the need to repair itself)\n * Silicone\n * Methicone \n * Dimethicone\n * Cyclohexasiloxane\n * many other silicone derivatives (most ending with \"cone\")\n\n\n***\n\n**Skin Soothing ingredients**\n\nWhen you start peeling, this will help the skin reduce inflammation and heal.\n\n* Manuka Honey\n* Gotu Kola / Centella asiatica/ Madecassoside/ Madecassic acid\n* Allantoin\n* Calendula\n* Bisabolol / Camomile\n* Cucumber\n* Aloe Vera\n* Licorice Root\n* Oatmeal\n* Beta-Glucan\n* Zinc oxide (used in baby diaper rash creams too)\n* Snail \n\n***\n\n**Healing ingredients to include**\n\nUse this to accelerate healing from the \"Tret face\"\n\n* Copper peptides\n* EGF/ DNA repair\n\n*** \n\nRetinoids research\n\n* [Retinoids in the treatment of skin aging: an overview of clinical efficacy and safety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699641/) by Siddharth Mukherjee et al.

Because it degrades in the presence of sunlight, if you leave the house at all it will be rendered ineffective (your sunscreen can only protect you so much).  If you want to use tretinoin more aggressively you should probably try to get a larger dose. \n(Speaking as someone whose GP prescribed tretinoin twice daily, all it will do is cause your skin to peel off as if you got a sunburn. Makes it impossible for products to absorb and looks terrible.)",

The first couple of days, my face was red (looks like a mild sunburn), so I took 1 night off of both Retin A and BHA/AHA, then continued the next day. Since then, I haven't experienced anymore irritation except for a bit of flaking around the nose area. \n\nI also seem to do things completely different from everyone else. I put it on pretty much right after I wash my face because I WANT it to get absorbed and not just wash off somehow on the pillow as I sleep or whatever. I also put it right under my eyes/nose area too, because wrinkles in that area. I also don't put anything on my face before or after I apply my Retin A, since I saw somewhere that recommends tret be right next to the skin to be more effective. \n\nI think Retin-A is so effective that I could get away with using it less frequently and being persistent about using it. But on the other hand, I get it on eBay so it's so cheap that I wouldn't care about using it nightly.",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is sorted alphabetically. (The price-per-ounce column was falling out of date too quickly with rapid price fluctuations; please see the [outdated 2024 version of the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/) for the most recent version sorted by price.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome!

    "body": "This new video called [Why Product Hopping Will Ruin Your Skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orP2YYqusDc) from Dr. Bunting is the tough love I needed to hear. It tears down a lot of concerning trends I have noticed in across internet skincare culture in recent years, many of which I've engaged in that have damaged my skin. Here's a summary.\n\n* People love newness. It's a bad habit. You need to look at your bathroom shelf and decide whether or not you have been pushing your skin too hard.\n* What is \"barrier function?\" The stratum corneum is the top layer of epidermis. It normally forms a tight waterproof barrier. It includes a film on top called the acid mantle which maintains a pH of 5.5 and allows a protective microbiome of healthy bacteria to thrive while inhibiting pathogenic bacterial growth. THIS is what healthy skin should be. When the acid mantle barrier is disrupted, the stratum corneum becomes cracked like a pair of leather shoes that were left out in the sun. Skincare products that are harmless on healthy, intact skin can now penetrate into deep layers where they aren't supposed to go, and this stimulates an inflammatory cascade which makes the skin behave in a sensitive way. It creates stinging, burning, breakouts, dry patches, etc.\n* *If you get cleansing wrong, it's hard to get skincare right.* Her patients with elaborate cleaning rituals tend to have skin problems. Oops. Foamy alkaline cleansers are bad. You want low-foam, low-pH cleansers that don't disrupt the barrier.\n* Have a good reason for using each of your leave-on actives. *No one needs a 10-skep routine**.* Too many people are using several actives in rotation and it wrecks their barrier. Introduce one active at a time and maintain a stable routine for several months to assess its long term effects. No product hopping. This is hard for those of us who get excited about ordering skincare hauls.\n* People always ask her how to combine their retinoids and AHAs. Many of these people already have sensitive skin, and some of them are playing fast and loose by rotating between multiple retinoids and multiple chemical exfoliants. She says to *stop the chemical exfoliants completely* and use the retinoid alone for a minimum of 3 months. Then make a careful decision about whether or not you still need an AHA.\n* Hydration: choose moisturizer with care. *S**imple formulas with fewer ingredients work best*. Look for products with aloe vera, bisabolol, and allantoin, which reduce the tendency of the skin to be fiery and irritable. Fragrance is bad.\n* Consider mineral-only sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide\n* Basically if your skin is having problems don't add steps to your routine to fix it. Remove products from your routine instead. Keep it simple.\n\n***What are your thoughts?***\n\nI get so sad when I see people here or in FB skincare groups who had perfect skin until they spent $150 to try a \"proper\" skincare routine and wound up panicked because their skin got flaky and red and they developed terrible acne.\n\nWhen I first started reading this sub in 2015, I didn't see quite as many people struggling with sensitive, inflamed skin. There were lots of multi-step asian routines in here but the popular ones were pretty gentle. Most people used the official [ScA routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/sca_routine) which is in line with most dermatologist recommendations. Using that routine saved my skin! The ScA mods are awesome and they still nudge people toward this solid advice. But the skincare world keeps expanding, serums have become more affordable, and the list of miraculous must-have ingredients has grown.\n\nIt's tempting to use every single \"magic active\" and viral product even though we have a full routine at home. IMO, product hopping happens because people feel like they are supposed to use micellar water *and* cleansing oil *and* a  foaming cleanser *and* vitamin c *and* a niacinamide *and* azelaic acid *and* an AHA toner *and* a BHA toner *and* an AHA/BHA peel *and* glycolic acid *and* lactic acid *and* tranexamic acid *and* hyaluronic acid *and* caffeine *and* co-Q10 *and* rosehip oil *and* peptides *and* squalane *and* alpha arbutin *and* bakuchiol *and* differin/tretinoin *and* benzoyl peroxide *and* an occlusive ointment *and* an eye cream *and* 3 different sunscreens for various occasions. People with acne rub oil into their skin so hard that they pull out grits (to the dismay of most dermatologists) but then they wonder why they are breaking out, so they use harsher actives to fix it. When we ruin our acid mantle with products and our faces become red and dry and sensitive, we buy things like Great Barrier Relief to fix it so we can go back to our arsenal of actives.\n\nI am totally guilty of this. When I watched this video I closed all of my skincare shopping tabs. No dermatologist has ever suggested that I use as many products as I do. I own multiple serums from the ordinary that I haven't even tried yet bc it has taken so long to figure out which other products from my haul my skin can tolerate.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? I already knew most of the facts that she explained, but she put it all together in a way that knocked some sense into me.",

Which- I’m not knocking TO at all, I think they even say you should not use more than 3 of their products in one routine or something like that, but the nature of it as well as the affordability gets people to go way overboard. Most people do not need niacinamide, then alpha Arbutin, then ascorbic acid, then tranexmic acid, then azelaic acid, then salicylic acid, then glycolic acid, then granactive retinoid. And then rosehip oil and squalane oil. I get it though. I randomly picked up Azelaic acid even though I’m happy with my routine because my mind was like “ooh maybe this will make my skin THAT much better.” When in reality I have nowhere to put it in my routine if I don’t want to use two actives in one routine and if I don’t want to have 3 days a week where I’m not doing anything except hydration and moisturizer.",

Amyris can produce these molecules at industrial scale. Amyris reprograms microorganisms to become mini biofactories capable of converting an input like sugar into a high value output like Farnesene (replacing petroleum as a source for chemicals). Amyris is the only synbio to date that has successfully scaled over 13 molecules with a 100% success rate since 2011.\n\nAll Precision Fermentation follows this process:\n\n1. **1. Strain engineering/screening (10% of the work)**\n   1. At this point, the strain can be monetized but comes with risks because Scale up and DSP are NOT proven. Companies like Ginkgo are on this stage (B2B)\n2. **Scale up fermentation (45% of the work)**\n3. **3. Down Steam Processing (45% of the work)**\n   1. At this point, ingredients can be sold in bulk + proven strain can be monetized (B2B)\n4. **4. Formulation**\n   1. At this point, white label formulas can be sold (B2B)\n5. **5. End Market**\n   1. Commercial Brand (D2C)\n6. **6. Valorization**\n   1. Companies like Amyris convert waste streams (from steps 1-3) to valuable ingredients like Bio Silica to be sold (in steps 3-5).\n\nAmyris is the only synbio that does steps 1-5 all by itself (Lab to Market) providing many advantages. Many other synbios are stuck on steps 2 and 3 which is where the real hardships are. Some synbios (like Ginkgo Bioworks) only do the 1st step and offset steps to their partners, but the reality is that *somebody* *has to deal with it*. It is my firm belief that **Synbios must go vertical before going horizontal**. Fermentation scale up and Down Stream Processing is where success is determined - do not fall for buzz words (AI, Codebase, AWS, etc.). **The reality is if a company is successful, their products will be successful in end-markets - You should be able to go to a store and purchase a product with an ingredient from your synbio.**\n\n[Synbio at a glance - Wiffle](https://preview.redd.it/4hkddycn1mo81.jpg?width=876&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfef1ca9474858d16aa5d7e3db1feb843e6b259d)\n\n**Amyris' business structure and technology came through the hardships of crossing the \"Valley of Death\".

Please go to:** https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/?\n\n Do you need to replace your beloved CeraVe moisturizer to veganize your routine? Is your skin so sensitive, it turns red just *thinking* about a new cleanser? Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is **sorted by price per ounce** so you can shop within your budget! (Price update in progress - April 2023.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome! Please let me know of any products I can add or anything on the list that has been discontinued.\n\n**Moisturizers without SPF**\n\n**Name** | **Packaging** | **ROUGH cost per oz in US** | **Notes**\n:- | :- | :- | :-\nQV Skin Lotion | pump | $0.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Cream | pump | $0.75 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Baby Moisturising Cream | tub & pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nATTITUDE Extra Gentle Daily Moisturizing Natural Body Lotion | pump | $1 | \nEthique Gentle Hand and Body Lotion Concentrate | concentrate | $1 | price is based on volume after adding water\nQV Intensive Cream | pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nBambo Nature Snuggle Time Body Lotion | tube | $1 |\nDesert Essence Hand and Body Lotion, Fragrance Free | tube | $1.25 | contains sunflower oil\nQV Baby Skin Lotion | tub & pump | $1.25 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nCeramedx Restoring Body Lotion | pump | $1.50 | contains safflower and sunflower oil\nYes to Avocado Fragrance-Free Daily Hand Cream | tube | $1.75 |\nShiKai Borage Therapy Lotion (Original Formula, Advanced Formula, or Children’s Formula) | pump | $1.75-$2 | contains safflower oil\nACURE Everyday Eczema Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nACURE Seriously Soothing 24hr Moisture Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nOrganic Fiji Nourishing Lotion with Organic Coconut Oil Fragrance Free | pump | $1.75 | contains sunflower oil\nPipette Baby Lotion | tube | $1.75 | \nCocokind Sake Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil\nDrunk Elephant Sili Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil, banana extract; parent company is not cruelty-free\nPipette Babykrav Oil | bottle | $2 | contains sunflower lecithin\nPure Anada Hand & Body Lotion - Unscented | pump | C$2 | contains sunflower oil\nAcne.org moisturizer | pump | $2 | may cause discoloration on pale skin\nQV Hand Cream | tube | $2.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nThe Seaweed Bath Co.

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

    "body": "So I always thought that ferments were a \"Asian skin care\" thing. But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

    "body": "\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive, patient-driven investigation into the efficacy of various topical agents in managing scalp psoriasis symptoms over a three-year period. Unlike traditional brand comparisons, the analysis isolates specific active ingredients found in over-the-counter and clinical treatments, assessing their impact through systematic self-experimentation. Key compounds evaluated include salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, coal tar, selenium sulfide, piroctone olamine, tea tree oil, pine tar, bisabolol, and ketoconazole. The findings suggest that while many mainstream treatments offer limited or purely symptomatic relief, a combination of 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide provided a near-complete remission without adverse effects. The study also highlights the efficacy of zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid—despite their underrepresentation in psoriasis-specific treatment literature—and raises questions about overlooked ingredients that may offer genuine therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n\nIntroduction:\n\nI am a guy who has suffered from scalp psoriasis since my teenage years. For most of that time, I relied on coal tar shampoo, but in the past two to three years, I’ve conducted extensive self-experimentation driven by personal frustration and informed by scientific literature. I undertook this journey with a goal: to isolate which specific chemicals—not brands—actually alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. Having read many peer-reviewed articles and product studies over the years, I focused strictly on ingredients featured in scientific research, avoiding anecdotal claims and brand biases. This self-experimentation was documented carefully to avoid confounding variables, aiming to provide clarity for others who may feel unheard or misinformed about their treatment options.\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\nEach treatment was tested in chronological order. I maintained consistent hair care routines and avoided introducing multiple new ingredients simultaneously, ensuring any effects could be attributed to the active compound in question. Products were selected based on scientific literature or suggested efficacy in treating similar dermatological conditions like seborrheic dermatitis. Observations were made over a period of several weeks per compound, and effects were noted regarding itch relief, flake reduction, hair/scalp health, and need for adjunctive care like conditioner.\n\n\n\nFindings and Analysis:\n\n-2% Ketoconazole: Provided no noticeable improvement in symptoms.\n\n-0.5% to 1% Coal Tar: Relieved painful itching and significantly reduced dandruff and flaking, but some remained.\n\n-3% Salicylic Acid: Eliminated flakes and fully cleared symptoms.\n\n-1% Zinc Pyrithione: Cleared all symptoms and left hair smooth, but caused hair thinning.\n\n-Tea Tree Oil (approx. % unknown): Reduced flakes and psoriasis, but damaged follicles and increased itch without conditioner.\n\n-1% Selenium Sulfide: Marginally reduced symptoms but did not eliminate pain, itch, or flaking.\n\n-1% Piroctone Olamine: Slightly more effective than selenium sulfide but also mostly symptomatic.\n\n-1% Salicylic Acid + 1% Selenium Sulfide Combo: Fully effective; no symptoms, no hair damage, and no need for conditioner. This combination was found specifically in the Vichy Dercos Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, which also contains several other compounds that may have contributed to its superior effectiveness. Among them is tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E), a known antioxidant which may also contribute anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, menthol is included, which I also noted helps prevent itchiness. The synergy of these ingredients may enhance its therapeutic profile.\n\n-Pine Tar (with Tea Tree Oil): Moderately effective, slightly better than tea tree oil alone, but difficult to isolate effects.\n\nSpecial Mentions:\n\n-Menthol: Provides significant itch relief and improves comfort.\n\n-Conditioner: Helps prevent scalp dryness, which can reduce flaking and itching when used with active treatments.\n\n-Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate): Acts as an antioxidant that protects scalp cells from oxidative stress and may offer additional anti-inflammatory support, potentially enhancing treatment effectiveness.\n\nPromising Untested Compounds:\n\n-Bisabolol: Not formally tested in this self-experimentation, but theorized to have potential due to its anti-inflammatory properties and scientific support in dermatological contexts.\n\n-Urea: Also untested directly in this study, but research shows highly promising effects in reducing scaling and inflammation in psoriasis, making it a strong candidate for future trials.\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results show a pattern of strong efficacy from salicylic acid and zinc pyrithione—both of which are rarely promoted as psoriasis treatments compared to coal tar. Coal tar and pine tar, although effective for itch, were less helpful in controlling flaking. Selenium sulfide and piroctone olamine offered symptomatic relief but no long-term benefit, suggesting their mechanism is more palliative than curative. Tea tree oil offered temporary improvements but presented drawbacks in hair follicle health. The combination of 1% salicylic acid with 1% selenium sulfide emerged as the most balanced and complete solution. Interestingly, ketoconazole, though widely recommended for scalp issues, had no effect on psoriasis, aligning with clinical skepticism about its use beyond fungal conditions. This study underscores the need for more ingredient-focused guidance in over-the-counter psoriasis treatments and suggests that compounds like salicylic acid, zinc pyrithione, and possibly bisabolol, urea, and pine tar deserve more clinical attention.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThrough persistent, controlled self-experimentation over three years, I found that the most effective treatments for scalp psoriasis were not always the ones most commonly advertised. The best results came from 3% salicylic acid and 1% zinc pyrithione individually, and even more so from a combined 1% salicylic acid and 1% selenium sulfide formula. This formula, found in Vichy Dercos, also contained tocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) and menthol, which likely contributed to its effectiveness by reducing inflammation and itchiness. These findings could serve as the basis for future controlled studies and provide a roadmap for other sufferers navigating treatment options.\n\n\n\nScientific References:\n\nSalicylic Acid: Lebwohl, 1999\n\nZinc Pyrithione: Kruglova et al., 2024\n\nCoal Tar: Slutsky et al., 2010\n\nSelenium Sulfide: van de Kerkhof & Franssen, 2001\n\nPiroctone Olamine: Lodén & Wessman, 2000\n\nTea Tree Oil: Summary\n\nPine Tar: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nBisabolol: Search\n\nUrea: Rachev et al., 2003\n\nMenthol: Prunel et al., 2012\n\nVitamin E: Cruz, 2013\n\nKetoconazole: Alford et al., 1986",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nNiacinamide is my favorite ingredient, and I have been doing a lot of thinking about which ingredients I am including. I decided to sit down and review some of my favorite products I have tried so that I can provide some information about the ingredient and what products were most beneficial.\n\nNiacinamide is an ingredient I can use in any quantity, and have experienced a reduction in oiliness, a lift in firmness, and a boost to the appearance of my pores as well as complexion. I know it’s not an ingredient everyone can use, but I can personally isolate the “glow from within” look to this one ingredient. Since this is vitamin B3, I will be referring to it often as such.\n\nMany niacinamide-based products will include zinc pca, which will in many cases make the serum very thin. This will also make the rest of my routine thin until the product is completely absorbed, so I will always note if the ingredient is included and what impact it has. I have dry skin that gets super oily in the summer while still needing hydration, so what is most important to me in my routine is firmly locking everything in. If I apply a moisturizer on after a serum with zinc pca, it will seem super thin and apply more like a serum than something meant to seal anything in. I love zinc, but it is just something I never put on a wet face. Finally, I don’t struggle very much with hyperpigmentation, so while these will all be effective treatments from a clinical perspective, I won’t be able to speak to their efficacy in this one arena.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\nSplash of water OR Isntree’s Onion Newpair Toning Pad\n\nThe Ordinary’s 10% Niacinamide Serum on dry skin\n\nEvian Thermal Water once skin is fully dry\n\nCos de Baha’s Peptide Toner\n\nIsntree’s Aqua Gel\n\nAquaphor on any dry spots\n\nSunscreen once dry (LRP’s SPF 70, 9Wishes’ Pine Treatment, and/or Skin 1004’s Hyalu-Cica Serum)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPM:\n\nFirst Cleanse (The Ordinary’s Glycolipid or Banila Co.’s Nourishing)\n\nSecond Cleanse (Then I Met You’s or Peach Slice’s Acne)\n\nThermal Water\n\nPeptide Toner\n\nAllies of Skin Niacinamide Serum\n\nIsntree’s Aqua Gel\n\nThick cream (The Ordinary’s NMF + Phytoceramides, Then I Met You’s, Aquaphor, or Avene’s Cicalfate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ordinary’s:\n\n10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc PCA Serum\n\n4/5\n\nThis serum gets a lot of points from me for being so accessible and cheap in the country I live in (America). It is just a touch too opaque to be transparent, and is a pretty viscous serum. I would compare it in texture to their HA serum, but because of the zinc, it applies very thin and watery. It will also bunch up if you apply too much on dry skin, which is uncommon for me with serums. This makes the rest of my routine watery, so I will always apply it on dry skin and wait for it to absorb before doing anything else. I appreciate basic serums that put a spotlight on their active ingredients, so this gets a major plus from me. Despite this being very similar to other products at similar percentages, I do find this to be a slightly less effective option. I am not really sure why, but it doesn’t boost glow as much as I would hope in addition to sometimes causing CC’s when used too often. I buy this if I am completely out of my Asian option, so I will be repurchasing more likely than not.\n\n100% Niacinamide Powder:\n\n5/5\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who isn’t an experienced user of this ingredient. I have never used it as directed as it advises to mix it with the product in your hand before applying, but I add this to basically any toner. I got into a “why buy a product without b3?” mentality recently, so I upgraded a few of my products with this. I buy the entire stock whenever Marshall’s has it because I am too lazy to buy the ingredient in bulk again. Short of buying B3 in bulk, this is your best option of upgrading the percentage of your current products. If you ever want to use this or other bulk options of ingredients, I would buy some cosmetic preservative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Inkey List’s Excess Oil Solution with 20% Niacinamide:\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is only to be recommended if you can get past The Inkey List’s packaging. It is ugly, but what I am making reference to is how difficult it is to dispense product from their tubes. This is 30ml, but I only ended up using maybe ⅔ of it because of how difficult it became to dispense after the halfway point. It sucks because I found this to be one of the best options on the market for high concentration B3. It has a lower concentration of Zinc PCA, so it is a nice creamy but light emulsion that stays that way. I was a big fan of this, but would never buy it again unless I had a foolproof option to decant it into something else. The fact it’s getting a 3.5/5 when I am this annoyed about its packaging should signal how useful this was while I had it. Top tier glow, super healthy skin, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCOS de BAHA:\n\n10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc PCA Serum:\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is basically The Ordinary’s serum, but it is completely clear in addition to having a bit more going on in its ingredient list. It is made in a base of aloe extract (just like the whole brand essentially), and is joined by a few other extracts like licorice, rosemary and thyme. I find this to be very basic, to have absolutely no smell, and to be a bit more effective than The Ordinary’s somehow at maintaining glow. It does render the rest of my routine a bit watery, but the effect is way less than that of The Ordinary’s. \n\n5% Tranexamic Acid + 5% Niacinamide Serum\n\n5/5\n\nI find this to be the perfect glow booster, and would try and use it in my morning routine when I used it. It is a very simple serum in the way that it almost exclusively amplifies these two actives, and it pays off for this. TA is an acid I have had excellent luck with when it comes to keeping my skin clear and glowy. This will be a serum I end up settling on for my AM serum, so you can anticipate me buying it again. It is a thick, viscous serum; and I have heard people complain about how tacky this and their other serums are. I prefer them like this, and would actively recommend this one for a high-strength glow booster/skin brightener. WRP\n\n20% Niacinamide + 4% Zinc PCA Serum\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a game changer as far as products went for me; it was finally when I accepted vitamin B3 as my lord and savior. I used this in very small quantities, and my face was brighter and healthier than it had ever been. This does make the rest of the routine somewhat thin (somehow still not as much as The Ordinary’s lol), but I got around this by using the sandwich method at the time. Isntree is coming out with a 20% that might end up beating this one, but this is my favorite niacinamide product at this moment. WRP if Isntree’s serum ain’t it\n\nAzelaic Acid Hinokitiol Clear Skin Serum\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is a fascinating product that I want more people to try. As a topical treatment, this ingredient list would have some genuine potential. It is, however, super watery, and so I never really felt like I could use it as a spot treatment. I would usually use it for my whole face in a sandwich between moisturizers just because of its intense concentration of actives. It has 10% Niacinamide, 5% Azelaic Acid, 1% salicylic acid, .1% retinol (I believe), tea tree oil, and a compound isolated presumably from hinoki called hinokitiol that is meant to assist with the clarity of skin. I found this to not do very much, which was a bit surprising given how much is going on here. I ended up ceasing usage because of its low impact and nasty nasty scent. It is mostly tea tree with a woody hinoki undercurrent, so if that appeals to you this might be a decent serum for you! It was just a bit too watery for something so concentrated - I am a firm believer that concentrated products need to either be a cream or a viscous serum, or else it just kind of gets everywhere. WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne Thing Niacinamide 10% Toner\n\n5/5 \n\nI am a big fan of this one because it is super basic and super cheap. It does just one thing, and does it perfectly. It is slightly more viscous than water, but not in the “fat water” way; and is completely scentless. My goal is to get my routine as simple as possible, and this would be a common fixture. WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIsntree has two lines I would recommend for the B3 content: C-Niacin and Onion Newpair. [Here is a link to my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/11zwn74/i_sat_down_and_reviewed_all_25_of_the_isntree/) where I review everything I have tried by the brand, including these lines in near completion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPSA’s Visible Improvement Peptides and Niacinamide Serum:\n\n5/5\n\nIf this weren’t more expensive than it needed to be, I would be repurchasing. It is truly the best niacinamide serum on the market in my opinion. You have a complete buffet of ingredients with 10% niacinamide, 10% peptide solution, glutathione, beta glucan, bisabolol, and resveratrol ferment. This is a nice, smooth emulsion that applies super easily across the entire face. Almost all the products I have tried from PSA/Allies have been super spreadable, which is something I didn’t even care that much about before trying them out. I no longer have the money to support a lifestyle that includes these brands, but if you do, the Visible Improvement serum is IMO their best option. The pump packaging was well-matched with the consistency, and I was able to get everything out just by using it. When I was done, the product was gone! MRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllies of Skin \n\nPrebiotics and Niacinamide Pore-Refining Booster\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis isn’t that much more expensive than PSA’s if we get down to cost/ml, but I would assert that the PSA serum is a much stronger crack at a B3 Buffet (trademarking this) serum. This is a super watery serum, which y’all already know I am not a massive fan of. To make matters a bit worse, the pump packaging kind of spits this everywhere due to its low viscosity. This is also a bit similar to the PSA skincare option as far as included ingredients, but lacks the peptides and beta glucan. I am still using this one, but I won’t be repurchasing it for the cost but also for the better option from the same brand.\n\nTranexamic & Arbutin Advanced Brightening System:\n\n5/5\n\nThis is unfortunately one of the best serums I’ve ever used. This is like Cos de Baha’s TN serum if it ate caviar. On top of 5% Niacinamide, 3% Tranexamic Acid, 5% fermented mushroom complex, and 2% arbutin, this is also one of the only products I have seen use hemisqualane. This is a superstar ingredient list, and because of its use of hemisqualane, this product is by far the most easily spread I have ever used. It comes in gorgeous silver packaging, but the product itself is an orange brown color and scentless. It made me look violently healthy and shiny without any oil on my face! I would put this on after my moisturizer and before my sunscreen to make sure it contributed to my finish as much as I could. This is THE buffet serum, but I wish it had more peptides. Apart from that, I could do an entire routine with just two drops of this, a hydrating toner, and a moisturizer. Big, big fan! WNRP but it’s because I am poor\n\nThat is everything! Let me know if y’all have any questions. :)",

    "body": "Sharing my post here as well. Recently, I had posted requesting dupes for Bite's Agave Lip Mask as it is now being discontinued. This stuff is ride or die lip salvation for me. I live somewhere super dry, work in a dry environment, take meds that dry me out, you get the picture. I'm a moisture junkie. I gathered the piece that works is the lanolin in it so I tried some similar products and wrote some reviews of them.\n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/kV6xjSG) are the products I've tried. Not pictured is the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, which I emptied and tossed the container.  From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It also got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. It's good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. It's a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. It's a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, it's going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!",

        "body": "First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair lip balm is my HG for dry lips. It’s a very thick, almost sticky, balm-mask. I usually have to warm a little of the product on my finger before applying it because it is so thick. It has a very slightly minty scent and a slight cooling sensation on application. It comes in a small tin, and one tin lasts me approximately a year of twice daily use. I also work in a hospital environment, and this is the only balm that has ever adequately protected my lips from the dry hospital air. It’s also currently $10 (half off) on their website. Thanks to you, I looked it up so I could post the ingredients and saw the sale so I’ll probably stock up on a little more!\n\n\nThe ingredients are: Cera Alba (Beeswax, Cire d'abeille), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Water/Aqua/Eau, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Lecithin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Glycerin, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Colloidal Oatmeal, Dimethicone, Aroma (Flavor), Urea, Mel (Honey, Miel), Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Propolis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Vanilla Planifolia Fruit Extract, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hydroxide, EDTA, Eugenol.",

    "body": "First of all, these are a list of products available in Boots that I've found, so they're non-exhaustive. Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

The next 28 terpenes are ordered alphabetically, and generally occur in smaller amounts.\n\n**1. Myrcene**  (Beta-Myrcene)  \nThe most common terpene in cannabis and hemp that can make up more than 2% of the weight of some [chemovars](https://www.royalqueenseeds.com/blog-cannabis-cultivars-vs-chemovars-vs-chemotypes-a-breakdown-n1374); also found in mangoes, thyme, citrus, and lemongrass, it has a musky, earthy, sweet herbal aroma. It is largely responsible for the green hop aroma in beer and is a major component in dry hopped beer. A [2021 published review study on Myrcene is here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8326332/).  \nBoiling Point: [333ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/31253#section=Boiling-Point) (167ºC)  \n*Reported Benefits:* THC agonist (helper), anti-diabetic, anticatabolic (preserves muscle mass), analgesic (pain reduction), gastrointestinal aid, neurological aid, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispasmodic, anti-tumor, sedative (relaxant or sleep aid) \n\n**2.** **Caryophyllene** (Beta- or Trans-Caryophyllene)   \nJust about as common as Myrcene in cannabis and hemp flower and can exceed 2% by weight. It has a spicy, peppery aroma and is also found in black pepper, cloves, hops, and oregano.  \nBoiling Point: [493ºF](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1060851.html) (256ºC) (several reputable sources have reported this to be 266ºF, but that is NOT at atmospheric pressure of 760mm Hg; [266ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/beta-caryophyllene#section=Boiling-Point) is the boiling point at 14mm Hg)  \n*Reported Benefits:* analgesic (pain reduction), antidepressant, anti-anxiety, bone stimulant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispasmodic, antitumor, anti-diabetic, gastrointestinal aid, neurological aid \n\n**3. Limonene**  \nThe final member of the \"Big Three\" terpenes in cannabis and hemp flower. Contributes a citrus aroma and is commonly found in citrus fruits, lemon rinds, juniper, and peppermint.  \nBoiling Point: [349ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/440917#section=Boiling-Point) (176ºC)  \n*Reported Benefits:* anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, anti-tumor, gastrointestinal aid, may potentiate cannabinoids (enhance bioavailability or effects)\n\n**4. Pinene** (Alpha- and Beta-Pinene)   \nPinene is considered the most common naturally-occurring terpene on earth. Both alpha-pinene and beta-pinene have similar properties and aroma. It's got that pine forest aroma and is found in pine needles, dill, basil, parsley, conifers, and sage.  \nBoiling Point: alpha: [313ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6654#section=Boiling-Point) (156ºC), beta: [331ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/14896#section=Boiling-Point) (166ºC)   \n*Reported Benefits:* alertness/focus enhancing, memory retention, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral, bronchodilator, gastrointestinal and neurological aid\n\n**5. Humulene** (Alpha-Humulene, Alpha-Caryophyllene)  \nContributes a woody, spicy-clove, \"watery\" aroma and is also found in allspice, hops, cloves and coriander. While it is common in cannabis and hemp flower, it is usually found in small amounts (<0.2%). Here's a [summary of recent research at ScienceDirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/humulene).  \nBoiling Point: 334ºF ([168ºC](http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1027221.html))  \n*Reported Benefits:* appetite suppressant, analgesic (pain reduction), anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-spasmodic, anti-tumor\n\n**6. Linalool**  \nA cannabis terpenoid also found in lavender, it has a floral, citrusy sweet aroma. Also found in citrus fruits, laurel, coriander, rosemary, sweet basil, eucalyptus, and rosewood.  \nBoiling Point: [388ºF](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6549#section=Boiling-Point) (198ºC)  \n*Reported Benefits:* analgesic (pain reduction), skin aid, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, anti-tumor, neurological aid, sedative (relaxant or sleep aid)\n\n**7. Terpinolene** (Alpha-Terpinolene, Terpinolen, Isoterpinene) \n\nHas a fairly complex aroma that has been described as fresh, herbal, sweet, floral, piney, smokey & woody.

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%.

    "body": "Hey guys!! I just wanna start off by saying I usually do reviews for Korean skincare, but as a Vietnamese person feel like I have so much pride in this brand which proudly comes from my country.\n\nYou mostly know that I am a Sulwhasoo and Whoo guy based on the focus of my reviews previously, and I had never told my followers why it is that I love them so much, in essence. In a world where Asian brands had to resort to using French names, chase high-tech ingredients, and employ Caucasian models, yet still losing market share to Western giants, these brands held true to their roots (literally) and celebrated their culture as well as herbalism. And now, they are the major players in the beauty industry, sitting beside the giants that once could've stomped them like a bug. To me, there is no greater inspirational underdog story in beauty than that. \n\nVietnam has never been popular for its cosmetics industry. Everything from bad packaging to greasy, poor-performing, and even occasionally dangerous formulas. The decent Viet brands wanted to distance themselves from that reputation therefore sometimes, they pretend that their product came from a more developed country (Canada, France, Korea...). \n\nCocoon was the first proudly Vietnamese brand of this echelon (they're sold in drugstores and supermarkets nationwide, online, and now in Malaysia, Singapore, and the US!). They're the second revolution in Vietnamese cosmetics history after Co Ba soap (hopefully writing a blog post about that soon). Extremely affordable, chic packaging, great scents, top-notch ingredients that you'd probably have some trouble finding in even higher-end offerings, and incredible results. They have products made from specialty crops grown in specific regions of Vietnam. This was actually an idea for a skincare line I had for such a long time but they really materialized it and brought it to life, which is beautiful for me. So, let's dive into the mega guide!\n\n##Winter Melon (Bí đao): This is their line for acne-prone, oily, congested, and inflamed skin. They use winter melon extract which is anti-inflammatory and hydrating along with other tried-and-true actives such as Niacinamide, Salicylic Acid, and a form of Azelaic Acid called Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate.\n\n\n###-Micellar water: \nSmells like the toner, with impressive cleansing power. You can remove very waterproof makeup with this. Leaves a refreshing feeling.\n\n\n###-Cleansing gel: \nThis was my cleanser for maybe the better half of 2021. I wouldn't say I mega love it but it's definitely a dependable cleanser and smells like a refreshing tea tree. It doesn't lather much and it doesn't leave my skin dry. The pH is 5.5 and I quite like it, but it gets mundane fast.\n\n\n###-Toner: \nA refreshing alcohol-free toner with winter melon extract, tea tree oil, and Niacinamide. It smells so good, It says it doesn't have \"Fragrance\" but it has rosemary and lavender oil which can explain the scent. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. I felt it was meh for my skin though.\n\n\n###-Mask:\nA soft-drying clay mask with tea tree oil and winter melon extract. Definitely not for sensitive skin. It gives your skin an immediate cool zinging effect which feels like menthol on the skin and I feel like people with more sensitive skin wouldn't like it. It dries quite soft and doesn't leave your skin feeling stripped or dry, but still very clean.\n\n###-Serum: \nThis is their most impressive product in this range by far, it's a serum with winter melon extract, 7% Niacinamide, TECA complex (centella asiatica and constituents), Acetyl Glucosamine, Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate, Ferulic Acid, Bisabolol, Salicylic Acid and Zinc PCA. The serum aims to provide global action for acne-prone skin by bringing down inflammation, hydrating, clearing pores, and brightening leftover acne marks. Now this all sounds great in theory however using it long term I've noticed it doesn't do everything claims to do flawlessly but some of it yes. My acne marks were visibly brightened, my skin looked less red and my texture was a lot more even, even though my raging zits didn't benefit from it. You do get a lot (70ml/2.33oz) for a little under 30 USD so that's great. The texture is very liquidy and foams up if you massage it into your skin which I find a bit off-putting. It wasn't enough to make me stop using it until the upgrade was released.\n\n###-N15 Serum: \nThe extra-strength version of the original serum, boasting a superstar lineup of 15% Niacinamide, 4% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Mandelic Acid, and many more. This formula originally came in a dropper bottle which made it impossible to dispense and generated many complaints, but I'm glad the brand took notes and repackaged it in a pump. Their attention to feedback is something I admire and that you will continue to see demonstrated in some of the products I name below. The formula is a bright orange, siliconey gel that dries a bit powdery, which you will definitely notice when it clumps up into residue around the nozzle. However, this is one of the best anti-acne treatments I've ever encountered. It targeted my acne in its premature, mature, and post-inflammatory stages and it's just one product. My skin looked visibly clearer after a month and I cannot thank this product enough. Holy grail. \n\n###-Acne drops: \nThis is an interesting spot treatment that omits Salicylic Acid, the first option that comes to mind when formulating a spot treatment. Rather than taking the traditional approach of pure decongestion, it employs 20% Azeclair (equivalent to 6% Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate by weight) in the formula to holistically reduce irritation, inflammation and discoloration. It works pretty fast and is exceptional at bringing redness down, whereas inflammation takes a bit more time. I highly recommend it with the N15. \n\n###-Gel cream:\nA gel cream formulated with 5a-avocuta and TECA to reduce inflammation and control oil production. It is surprisingly oily/tacky at first for a cream that claims to control oil but soaks up quite nicely leaving not much of a residue. On my predominantly dry skin it did not make it any drier. In fact my skin felt comfortable, but not for the whole day.\n\n###-Sunscreen: \nAt SPF 50+ and PA++++ with HEV protection, this unscented organic sunscreen marks one of Vietnam's first forays into the sunscreen market. It is surprisingly lightweight, however it does not dry down matte. I felt like I didn't sweat more with it in (which is a common occurence for sunscreen) and it did stay put very well. \n\n###-Body wash: \nThis is a soap-based body wash scented with lemongrass. It's got a golden liquid texture and foams up very well. It's meant for back acne, but I typically reserve it for the unmentionables OOP because it is deep cleaning, smells good, and prevents odors.\n\n###-Body mist: \nFormulated with a combo of AHAs and BHAs as well as winter melon extract, this body mist demonstrated an excellent anti-acne and anti-redness action on my friend's back. Whereas for me I also use it where I use the above-mentioned body wash since it helps to reduce bumps and even out skin tone for a home-wrecking, soul-crushing, undeniable boochie hole. I would note that this is not something you want on your mucus membranes so please cover them up when spraying areas like your groin.\n\n##Hưng Yên Tumeric (Nghệ): \nThis is their brightening line which uses turmeric from Hưng Yên (my grandma's hometown!) and many other proven actives such as Ethylated Vitamin C, Hexylresorcinol, Acetyl Glucosamine, AHAs and Niacinamide. What I like about this line is that it uses many derivatives of turmeric rather than just its extract.\n\n###-Cleanser: \nFor sure smells like turmeric, not in your face but it's definitely there. 4% of Lactic Acid makes the skin feel slightly smoother after cleansing. Reminds me a lot of my once HG Sulwhasoo Snowise cleanser actually.\n\n###-Toner: \nA toner with 5% AHA and Betaine that aims to brighten, hydrate and smooth skin texture. This formula smells amazing, is hydrating enough to be a treatment essence and after 2 weeks of use leaves skin with a soft glow. All round solid toner even though I'd call it a treatment essence. The addition of Allantoin also lends a nice soothing effect.\n\n###-Mask: \nClay mask enriched with turmeric powder and oatmeal which claims to brighten. It smells strongly of turmeric and has granules. It dries harder more like a traditional clay mask like Kiehl's Tumeric and Cranberry mask and less like their own winter melon mask. My skin always feels nicely clean after using it although instant brightness is not observed.\n\n###-Serum: \nAlso another impressive product from them. Contains 10% Ethylated Ascorbic Acid, a water-stable form of Vitamin C highly efficacious for brightening. Along with that, it's paired with 4% Niacinamide, 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine, and turmeric oil. It's an orangey gel serum that consists of a continuous yellowish phase with orange droplets suspended throughout. The texture absorbs quickly and leaves the skin slightly moisturized. Results are noticeable at 4 weeks, the skin is more glowing and even-toned. Considering the steep price of ethylated Vitamin C, I am surprised to find out the serum is roughly $30 for a 1oz bottle!\n\n###-C22 Serum: \nAn upgraded version of the classic Serum, this serum contains a whopping 22% of 3-0-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid compared to the original serum's 10%. They also included 4% Niacinamide and 2% N-Acetyl Glucosamine like the original. Still, they bolstered the heightened efficacy with 1% Hexylresorcinol for powerful melanin control and 0.5% Ferulic Acid to create an antioxidant synergy with the Ethylated C. Instead of using turmeric oil to mimic the original, they opted for turmeric extract, which made the formula's color a mild yellow. The texture is fresh and fluid as water, only it left a slightly emollient finish like an oil which was interesting to say the least. After 4 weeks, the serum had a noticeable effect on the dark spots on my periorbital area and redness was reduced. Because of the higher C concentration, my skin did tingle at times after applying the product following another product with actives. And for just 35 USD, this product is absolutely a must-try.\n\n###-Gel cream: \nA gel cream enriched with turmeric extract, curcuminoids, and Hexylresorcinol. This is the lightest moisturizer Cocoon has to offer, bursting into water upon application. It only makes me wonder if it works to moisturize at all. That being said, my skin feels well-rested and fresh after using this every night, and less dull by the end of the day when I use it in the morning. That being said, for as long as this will last me, I will use it as a day cream.\n\n###-Mist: \nA mineral-enriched mist containing powerful antioxidants such as turmeric extract, superoxide dismutase salts, and EGCG. The addition of 5 amino acids also helps to increase moisture retention. The mist smells lovely, the grain of the droplets is extremely fine and almost comparable to an aerosol and it is lovely to apply over makeup. It does help the foundation oxidize less, but I have not noticed much long-term skincare benefit.\n\n##Rose: Sourced from the roses on the highlands of Cao Bang, this line is focused on providing hydration and reparative benefits. The rocky terrain and calciferous nature of the soil create a perfect environment for the growth of Damask roses, rich in tannin which is known for its astringent properties.\n\n###-Bi-phase Micellar Water: \nA true warrior for eye makeup, this bi-phase micellar cleanser was the result of repeated complaints about its predecessor's cleansing abilities. Formulated with rose extract, god-tier antioxidant Astaxanthin, and repairing Vitamin B5. This micellar water removes just about anything and is very gentle on the skin. It also feels more moisturizing than the Winter Melon one But I am not a fan of wiping my makeup off anyway so I won't be reaching for this a whole lot.\n\n###-Cleansing Oil: \nA non-emulsifying, yet rinseable cleansing oil that gives a very interesting feeling. On one hand, it feels very much like an oil on the skin and removes makeup effortlessly. On the other, it is not a true oil chemically speaking, so it can not emulsify but rather just rinse clean off the skin. I really love this product and it is by far my favorite cleanser of the brand, but I would describe this as a one-step cleansing serum. My skin was so smooth after and just clear of everything.\n\n###-Cleansing Gel: \nIt is lightly foaming and subtly scented by the rose. Gives a nice clean that is not drying. But not the most interesting cleanser.'\n\n###-Toner:  \nMade with real rose petals and Hyaluronic Acid, this toner is strikingly plain compared to the precedent other Cocoon products I've tried have set, so I've found it to be nice and enjoyable but quite underwhelming.\n\n###-Mask:\nA rinse-off gel mask with rose petals, Pentavitin and Hyaluronic Acid. It became my new favorite hydration mask ever since I discovered that you can just rub it into the skin with little stickiness. I've used it as a sleeping mask since over moisturizer and I've never woken up with dull skin again. Also since it smells so good, I genuinely don't feel like rinsing this mask off does it justice, but YMMV.\n\n###-Serum:\nHands down, the most impressive hydration and repair serum I have ever used. Holy grail status. It is so fresh and light, but it bears so much substance. Packed with 5% Vitamin B5, 5% Betaine, 5% Urea, Ectoin, Hyaluronic Acid, and rose extract, this serum is an antioxidant powerhouse that calms irritation and hydrates profoundly. Its juicy texture goes a long way and I can see a major improvement in my skin's plumpness and tone after one bottle. Makes my foundation go on better, is amazing on lips, all round great hydrating product. Snag yourself a bottle now because this is my favorite product from Cocoon ever,\n\n###-Gel Cream: \nThe richest moisturizer that Cocoon has to offer, but with that being said it's not that rich. I can use it as a night cream when days are a bit hotter, but under my AC, I always pair it with my trusty Whoo Cheongidan oil. It's got Pentavitin, rose water, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin B5, which seems in line with everything else in the range. And I could say that it's a solid staple moisturizer most skin types (except very oily) can enjoy. Drier skins might appreciate this more mixed with a facial oil.\n\n##Dak Lak Coffee: An exfoliating and nourishing line for the body. face and lips made from upcycled coffee grounds. The coffee used was grown in Dak Lak, the capital of coffee in Vietnam.\n\n###-Body Scrub: \nThis creamy, deliciously-scented body scrub smooths, polishes and moisturizes. It is not the most groundbreaking product since it's not the first, but Cocoon's creamy formula along with the appropriately sized coffee granules gave my skin a much-needed invigorating scrub that leaves it softer every time. No wonder it's their #1 best seller.\n\n###-Facial Scrub: \nMade with finer coffee grounds than the body scrub, this unscented scrub smells more naturally coffee than the body scrub's delicious milky coffee scent. It goes on the skin smoothly and is a scrub that never fails to bring the skin an instant glow. I use it in the shower all the time and I love it with my chemical exfoliators because it's got just the right density of granules.\n\n###-Lip Scrub: \nA scrub-in-stick featuring Cocoon's finest coffee grounds suspended in a creamy base of macadamia oil and shea butter. This lip scrub effectively removes dead skin flakes, but at the end of the day not much more impressive than your regular lip scrub. But what more can you ask from a product under 3 USD?\n\n###-Body Butter: \nA deeply moisturizing butter with coffee oil, tamanu oil and shea butter. This was very rich which was surprising, since I was under the impression Cocoon tends to shy away from richer textures. Granted, this is their only richly textured product.\n\n##Pomelo: A haircare line that harnesses the Pomelo oil's active molecule Limonene for effective hair fall reduction, as well as Xylishine, Vitamin B5, and amino acids to thicken, condition, and add shine.\n\n###-Shampoo: \nA sulfate-free shampoo aimed towards all types of hair. This is my regular shampoo since it smells so amazingly citrusy, but I will have to say it's not the most conditioning shampoo, as I felt my bleached hair was quite dry and tangled after shampoo and before conditioner. I also noticed it is not the most color-safe shampoo, and I learned that the hard way when I had my hair dyed blue. But now that I only lighten my hair, I consider this a solid shampoo in terms of cleansing efficacy and strengthening effect.\n\n###-Conditioner: \nA conditioner that smells equally amazing and is so wonderfully smooth. It rinses clean and leaves the hair smooth and soft. Shine is dramatically amplified. Although I regret to say the smoothness was short-lived, only lasting half a day after washing, I understand it is more formulated for virgin Asian hair, not needy bleached hair like mine. They changed the packaging from a pump to a tube due to consumer demand.\n\n###-Hair mask: \nMy favorite hair mask of 2023. The texture is kind of marshmallowy, reminiscent of L'Oreal Professionel's Blondifier mask, albeit a little thicker. Smells amazing and I can feel it gives my hair longer-lasting nourishment than the conditioner, which is why I have substituted it for the conditioner entirely. My hair's shine is so unreal and the softness is incredible.\n\n###-Hair tonic: \nA tonic with Baicapil, Bisabolol, Vitamin B5 and Bisabolol. This product is again another improvement from its predecessor, which was greasy and had a jammed spray nozzle. The new oil-in-water formula comes together shaken, and applied through a targeted nozzle. The new formula is much lighter, has a light hold, and works to increase shine and reduce hair fall.\n\n##Mint and Eucalyptus: A refreshing body care line with mint and eucalyptus oils. The scent is deeply reinvigorating and refreshing but leans a bit masculine.\n\n###-Body Wash: \nThis body wash smells woodsy almost, with an unmistakable menthol tingle. It cleans properly, foams well, and does not dry out the skin. A bit steeper priced compared to drugstore body washes but worth the try.\n\n###-Body Lotion: \nSame scent but no tingle. Its a light gel cream formula that gently hydrates and smooths.\n\n###-Hand soap: \nNever used this one but bet it smells the same. And it is bunny shaped :3\n\n###-Hand Sanitizer: \nMy go to tbh. It smells so spa like using it every time, and I've gotten so many compliments from friends and strangers!\n\n##Miscellaneous products: These are products not from any particular range\n\n###-Palmyra Sugar Body Scrub: \nAn oil and sugar scrub that smells fresh and zesty yet warm. It instantly and dramatically refines skin texture and leaves behind a trace of moisture. My personal favorite of the two Cocoon body scrubs.\n\n###-Inca Inchi hair serum: \nA hair oil with Omege 3, 6 and 9, holy basil oil and vitamin E. This is your average silicone based hair oil and not sure if it works better than a cheaper silicone hair serum but my hair likes it.\n\n###-Ben Tre Coconut Lip Balm: \nMy hometown Bến Tre is known for it's coconuts. The oil extracted from coconuts are used to make this lip balm. It goes on clear and matte, and it gives good emollience to the lips. That being said, it is not that different than other coconut lip balms, maybe the fact that it has a matte finish.\n\n#So that's been it for Cocoon and I'll be back to review more if they launch more. I hope you guys give it a try because I certainly love it!",

She used to have thinning hair because she had a condition before that compromised her immune system.  When I visited her after a few months, I noticed that her hair got thicker.  She just used the shampoo, conditioner, and especially the tonic.

    "body": "Hello ScA! I was adviced to share this post here. Check out the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from AsianBeauty sub, and the [other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/cst06i/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from scacjdiscussion sub for other people's knowledge-bombs in the comment sections!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called \"ato\" products, assuming short for \"atopic\".)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)\n\nAll of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories.

So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.\n\nOilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.\n\nI hope this helps some of you!\n\nYou don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle.

There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical.

You can take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/aqp89b/product_question_eucerin_5_urea/) for my argument for Urea vs Hydroxyethyl Urea.\n\nOne thing about Urea would be that i would recommend not to use it extensively for dehydrated skin as it can over exfoliate over a period of use. People may also experience similar effect with other ingredients and alternatives to Urea such as Allantoin and other ingredients that increases desquamation. \n\nPersonally from my own DIY testing, where i live in a hot & humid country and spend most time in the office with AC that is very drying which make my face very dehydrated, an occlusive or alternatively using a cream with liquid crystal emulsifiers + fast absorbing ester would be the best in maintain hydration and skin moisture.",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\". These have different names because they're pseudoceramides and/or a part of a patented biomimetic system/delivery method.\n\nSkin Identical Ingredients/ceramides/helpfuls highlighted in **BOLD** except for hyaluronic acid because I can't tell if high molecular weight or low molecular weight HAs were used (some find LMW HA irritating).\n\n*Fragrance = essential oils & artificial fragrance, left in fragrant extracts (less concentrated than essential oils)*\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[**Curél Intensive Moisture Facial Cream**](https://www.ulta.com/intensive-moisture-facial-cream?productId=pimprod2009883) **- 1.4 oz/40 g -

    "body": "TL;DR: title\n\nI have been allergic to chamomile my whole life. Ragweed destroys me and sleepytime tea tastes like itching, and anything with chamomile in it for hair or skin makes me itch like crazy. I don't go into full anaphalaxis but it's not exactly pleasant. So of course I scour skincare labels for both chamomile and *Matricaria recutita* to keep myself safe. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, and typically when products include chamomile, they advertise it like it's a good thing, so it hasn't been too hard to steer clear.\n\nOver the summer I used Supergoop's spray sunscreen, which I liked initially--my skin tends to be fine with alcohol. But when I got home I had a truly incredible allergic reaction: my face got puffy and itchy and felt horrible. There was almost nothing else on my face so it couldn't have been anything else but the face spray; I assumed it was a heavy dose of rosemary oil or something I had been exposed to and ditched the product as a failed experiment.\n\nNow lately I've been using a fancypants sunscreen from Oneskin, and it's winter, so my skin being itchy dry isn't anything new; I live in the desert. Our humidifier started leaking so I hadn't used it and I assumed it was that. But my skin doesn't *feel* dry, and I started developing eczema around my eye and eyelid. No amount of moisturizer has fixed it and the itch is constant, and my skin hasn't been flaking the way it does when it's really, really dry. Something new was wrong, I figured, but there wasn't really much that was really new in my routine save the sunscreen which I had been using for a month. Finally I connected the dots and compared the ingredients in my current routine to see what might be the culprit. One of the ingredients they had in common was bisabolol.\n\n>**Bisabolol**, or more formally α-(−)-bisabolol or also known as **levomenol**,[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisabolol#cite_note-1) is a natural monocyclic [sesquiterpene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquiterpene) alcohol. It is a colorless viscous oil that is the primary constituent of the [essential oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) from [German chamomile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_chamomile) ([*Matricaria recutita*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_recutita)) and [*Myoporum crassifolium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoporum_crassifolium).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisabolol#cite_note-2)\n\nTurns out bisabolol is in a *ton* of skincare, ironically for it's anti-inflammatory properties. It's the second ingredient in the Supergoop spray sunscreen, which explains why my reaction was so bad and immediate; it's much lower on the ingredients list in the Oneskin sunscreen which explains why it has crept up on me more slowly. It's also in almost every other spray sunscreen meant to go over makeup, which is highly annoying.\n\nIf you are allergic to ragweed, you may react to chamomile. If you're allergic to chamomile, watch out, because they're sneaking that stuff into everything under a new name now and it's strong enough to almost swell both my eyes shut. Be careful out there, folks.",

Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water.

The reviews on Sephora have been fantastic and it has 20% THD ascorbate (which they call a mega-potent, ultra stable form of vitamin c. They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types. Do you have any experience with this? \n\nPS- thank you so much for your comprehensive list, it is much appreciated!! Paula’s Choice is having 20% this weekend (on one product) so I am contemplating trying her vitamin c serum. I will be shy on free shipping though, and not sure what else to order lol.",

        "body": "Wow, nice post! I'll be shopping around later, love trying new products. Did you make a mistake on the Skinlex one btw? It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "RRP Price: $165.\nSize: 10g.\nPer MG: $0.07.\nOrigin: Winlaw BC, Canada. \nCultivator: Kootenay Quantum.\nPlant Species: Sativa Dominant. \nTHC: 25%.\nCBD: <1%.\nLineage: Dark Matter x Cali Diesel x God. \n\nTotal Terpenes: 3.47%\nDominant Terpenes: Terpinolene (1.20%), Farnesene (0.75%), Trans-Caryophyllene (0.40%) & Ocimene (0.31%), Myrcene (0.30%).\n\nlet’s start with the Visuals, the box it comes in. The colours are mainly Blue and white giving it that fresh clean look which also shows in the name Crystal and how the text and colours resemble ice or something shiny ✨. The symbols on the box give me a space type of vibe diamonds in the sky which fits in nicely with the two Dark Matter & God Lineage in the strain. \n\nI Opened up the box to get the jar out which I always find satisfying holding the CraftBotanics and SingleEstate jars, comes in a glass jar which is always nice for storage. So opening the Jar I got hit with a very strong smell which I have never smelt in a strain before and the name that came to mind was a sweet champagne. Now I don’t drink and especially wine but I have tried Preseco in the past and all I can say is it describes the strain to a T. \n\nFine bottles of Prosecco offer up aromas of tropical fruits, banana cream, hazelnut, vanilla, and honeycomb. The Tropical Aroma is coming from Terpinolene & Ocimene and I’m also getting the same taste I was getting from  Auratherapeutics Apples & Bananas. The Crisp apple taste would be coming from Farnesene and maybe the banana flavour from a max of the terpenes Caryophyllene, limonene and Alpha-Bisabolol bringing a nutty fruity creaminess which could convert to a banana essence possibly.\n\nSo been changing the temps of my ball vape just as the Taroma Lite Plus holds 300-310 rubies and can hold allot of heat even at low temps, meaning I can go lower than usual and still get thick vapour, flavour and good extraction. So I changed my temp to 515 and do heat soaks. I grinded up and loaded a small bowl (smaller are better). I placed the head in the titanium bowl and let it heat soak till the temp dropped to 480 and back up to 508 and I start hitting it slow, slowly increasing how much I pull till I reach around 518. Usually it’s basically extracted it all and I’ll go in for a small second hit just to finish up. \n\nThe Flavour was how I describe the aroma, a Sweet Tropical Champagne with after tones of Apples and Cream Bananas, very unique and not a mix I’ve ever had before. Now time for the effects, this strain is a Sativa and from the mix of Terpenes I found this strain to be almost creeping into the hybrid feel but still retains its Sativa feeling. The High terpinolene produced a euphoric mind high, enhanced my mood and provided an energetic, active feeling. Although I did feel the sedative side of terpinolene mixing with myrcene which is why I said it had a hybrid feel to it aswell. \n\nFarnesene’s Terp benefits are reducing inflammation, relieving pain, easing anxiety, promoting relaxation ect ect there’s plenty of benefits that come with them but these are the ones I noticed helping me especially after a long day out and I come back and it’s still day time out and I don’t feel like being tired and still wish to be active it allows me to be more energised and productive whilst easing my pain, anxiety and also reducing any inflammation I may have especially since I dislocated my elbow 5-7weeks ago I still have a swollen arm so it helps allot. \n\nOverall I give this a 9.9 out of 10, the most unique flavours I’ve came across, I really enjoy the effects and how it works for me with my day to day activities. I do know this strain has been shortlisted to Win awards so I would 100% try this strain is your into your Tropical Terpinolene Sativa Strains. ",

From left to right I have the Bite lip mask, Lanolips Lanostick, Lanolips 101 ointment, Glossier Balm Dotcom in 3 flavors (original, birthday cake, and rose), Go-To Lips, Jack Black, Aquaphor, and Vaseline.\n\n**Bite Agave Lip Mask** 10/10\n\n    Ingredients: Trans-Resveratrol, Lanolin (Pharma Grade), Organic Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Organic Butyrospermum, Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Rosinate, Organic Agave Tequilana (Blue Agave) Nectar, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil Unsaponifiables, Organic Cera Alba (Beeswax), Flavor, Vanillin, Siraitia Grosvernori (Monk Fruit), Vanilla Tahitensis (Vanilla) Fruit Extract, Organic Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Trans-resveratrol, Vitis Vinefera (Grape) Oil, Tocopherol Acetate, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, and Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, +/- May Contain: Mica (CI 77019), Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Carmine (CI 75470).\n\nI think what has done it for me with this one is the occlusive elements as well as moisturizers. I can see it has oils and lanolin plus beeswax. I like the thick texture which is almost sticky as well as the tube packaging. I personally like the absence of SPF as when I am really chapped those can sting/burn my lips. I also really like the smell/taste of the original. The small tube lasts a long time and it saves me a lot of discomfort in the dry winters, especially working in a hospital with all the recycled air. \n\n**Lanolips Lanostick** 8/10\n\n    Lanolin*, ricinus communis (castor) seed oil*, capryloyl glycerin/sebacic acid copolymer*, cera alba (beeswax)*, caprylic/capric triglyceride*, persea gratissima (avocado) oil*, jojoba esters (simmondsia chinensis)*, aroma (nat flavour)*, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter*, euphorbia cerifera (candelilla) cera*, magnifera indica (mango) seed butter*, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil*, copernicia cerifera (carnauba) cera*, tocopherol (vit E)* *100% natural/naturel\n    \nI feel like this one on the lips is very similar in feel to the Bite. It is probably my favorite of the dupes that I've tried. It has a lot of similar ingredients such as the lanolin, castor oil, beeswax, shea butter, and some other oils. It has a different flavor/scent than the Bite mask. It is almost citrus in nature? I think I can see myself using this one once I go through my stash of Bite (thanks to the redditor who messaged me saying Sephora kept restocking, I was able to snag some). My complaint? The fact it is a stick and not a tube! I haven't lost the cap of this in my pocket yet but that happens to me with regular sticks. I also worry the stick will break because it gets too soft from being stored in my pocket. All in all the best dupe so far.  It too got me through days at the hospital without wanting to rip my lips off my face so win.\n\n**Lanolips 101 Ointment** 7/10\n\n    Ingredients: Lanolin, lanolin oil. *naturally derived/*Dérivé naturellement.\n\nI got this one because I was already ordering from Ulta and was able to use a coupon and my points, I imagine it is basically the same as the nipple creams and other straight up lanolin out there. It is good. Tube is nice. Cap doesn't stay on super great. No color or flavor so I can use it for my cuticles and other dry patches. I can't complain but I'm not gonna sing out from the rooftops or anything like that. You can get lanolin only products much cheaper for much more product elsewhere. It does do its job locking in moisture though.\n\n**Glossier Balm Dotcom** 8/10\n\n    Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Beeswax/Cera Alba/Cire d’Abeille, Lanolin, Theobroma Grandiflorum Seed Butter, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, BHT, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol.\n\nI know I originally wanted to avoid petroleum based products but I did have a sample of it that I liked well enough so I got the 3 pack on Glossier's site to try the other flavors. Original seems to be more sticky than the other flavors and feels more like the Bite mask. It does a good enough job, the flavors are fun. I like the tube packaging. The rose is so much better than the perfume co. rose balm which is rose flavored vaseline. I feel like it did a good job moisturizing and lasting to lock in the moisture while I was at work too.\n\n**Go-to Lips** 4/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tUltra Medical Grade Lanolin, Shea Butter, Apricot Kernel Oil, Beeswax, Sweet Almond Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vitamin E, Fragrance (Pure Pomegranate), Pomegranate Seed Oil, Calendula Oil, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil.\n\nI think I might be rating this lower because I had higher expectations for it. The ingredients sound great. Its in a nice tube. But its so slippery, it feels like a lip oil on the lips instead of a balm or sticky mask. It has a strong scent/flavor but it isn't unpleasant. Its so messy out of the tube though because it is so slick! I wasn't looking for an oil so I'm a little bummed. I can't say it doesn't moisturize my lips though but it doesn't have the staying power to make use of the occlusives in it. \n\n**Jack Black Lip Balm** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tBeeswax, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, C 18-38 Alkyl Hydroxystearol Stearate, Camellia Sinenesis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Cyclohexasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Flavor, Lanolin, Microcrystalline Wax, Ozokerite, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Polyglyceryl 3 Beeswax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nPretty middle of the road chapstick. Theres some beeswax, some lanolin, some shea butter. It has SPF though which is a negative for me for a day to day balm. I guess there isn't a lot wrong with it, it doesn't dry me out but if I am dry it stings. Its a little slicker than Bite too. I got it awhile ago as a sample and it just didn't wow me but it is a popular item.\n\n**Aquaphor Healing Ointment Advanced Therapy** 5/10\n\n    Active ingredient: Petrolatum (41%) – Skin protectant Inactive ingredients: Mineral Oil, Ceresin, Lanolin Alcohol, Panthenol, Glycerin, Bisabolol\n\nI use this at work when I leave chapstick at home because we have samples of it everywhere. Its good for prevention of radiation dermatitis if you're into that sort of thing. It has no flavor, no taste. Its slippery and greasy feeling due to the high petroleum content. Its a solid product in general just not for my dream chapstick replacement. Good stuff though. Will continue to have on hand.\n\n**Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Healing** 2/10\n\n    Active ingredient: White Petroleum, USP 100%. Inactive ingredient: Flavor.\n\nLiterally marked up vaseline. What makes it more advanced than regular Vaseline?? Doesn't do much for me but vaseline never did. I bought it from the pharmacy at work when I left my chapstick at home. I do like the tube so I guess it isn't pointless. \n\n**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask** 5/10\n\n    Ingredients: \tDiisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl / Isostearyl / Cetyl / Stearyl / Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax / Cera Microcristallina / Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax / Candelilla Cera / Cire de Candelilla, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Butylene / Ethylene / Styrene Copolymer, Ethylene / Propylene / Styrene Copolymer, Mica (CI 77019), Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Dimethicone, Fragrance / Parfum, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax / Cera Carnauba / Cire de Carnauba, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Yellow 6 Lake (CI 15985), Red 6 (CI 15850), Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Water, Potassium Alginate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Alcohol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Ascorbyl Glucoside.\n\nOk at the risk of sounding crunchy granola AF what the hell is some of the stuff in this? Why does there need to be a million things in this? Theres some shea butter, some synthetic wax, other wax, silicones, and other stuff in it. No lanolin or petroleum. If you're allergic to lanolin its probably good. It's not bad. Its a little too slippery for my likes in a lip product. It doesn't stay on a long time. It doesn't seem to moisturize better than any other product. It doesn't seem to hurt my lips. I don't like the little tub it comes in because I don't want to wash my hands every time I wanna put lip balm on. It costs a little much for what it is for me. \n\n\n**Closing Arguments** *TL;DR*\n\nWhile Bite may be my ride or die, its going the way of the dinosaur. Lanolips has good products, the lanostick might be the most similar in terms of ingredients/feel although the packaging is different. Glossier's balm is suitable too although it does have petroleum in it. Most of these products do have lanolin and/or beeswax in them so they aren't suitable for vegans. \n\nI'd love to hear if there are any I missed trying, despite having tons of chapstick I am a chapstick junkie so I'd be interested to hear!!",

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around.

Check out the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/csfm1l/guide_ceramides_in_skin_care_a_scam_ceramide/) from AsianBeauty sub for other people's knowledge-bombs in the comment sections!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHi again, AB!! So I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/) talking about how most companies that claim to have ceramides actually use 2 ceramide \"soups\" basically, of the purpoted \"ideal\" ratio of ceramides/fatty acids, of which contain actually very, very little ceramides. Basically, it's for marketing and such a low % won't really do much. But the research for actually using an efficient amount of ceramides is apparently ***very*** good for barrier repair.\n\nSO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Yes, the technology behind Atopalm is the same behind Zerafite, which Dr. Baumann believes in and sells through her practice. The research and invention originally came out of Korea, so I am not surprised Korean brands are using it.**  \n>  \n>\\-  [u/nocloudstoday](https://www.reddit.com/user/nocloudstoday/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?\n\nAnd:\n\n>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**  \n>  \n>\\- u/[royalsincognito](https://www.reddit.com/user/royalsincognito/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.\n\nSo it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen \"ceramide\" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**\n\nI was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!\n\nNeopharm's ceramide technology is called **\"MLE\"** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**\n\nPersonally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!\n\nFrom all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics.

No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.\n\nMany people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).\n\nRave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however.

There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**\n\nI'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.\n\nNow, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:\n\n>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).\n\nUrea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.\n\nBut AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.\n\n(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \\- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)\n\nFor people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed \"so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!\", because\n\n>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)\n\n\\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.\n\n**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some moisturizers with urea:**\n\n(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)\n\nI know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical.

There are also some studies done on animal models or ex-vivo of human skin tissue that show a potential for wound recovery and healing by using certain peptides. \n\nVerteporfin, a YAP inhibitor, may reduce scarring after hair transplants; it would be interesting to see if it could be used with peptides like KPV or TB500.   \n  \nOsteopontin derivates are currently being explored by Amplifica and Follicums; FOL-005 by Follicum and AMP303 by Amplifica. These derivates are peptides themselves and show some promise. \n\nDelivering these peptides through the skin is challenging due to their size and hydrophilicity, but methods like chemical enhancers, liposomal delivery, sonophoresis, iontophoresis, and electrophoresis show promise. Iontophoresis uses electrical currents to drive peptides through the skin, while sonophoresis uses ultrasound waves to enhance skin permeability. Combining these peptides with Verteporfin in a lipid bandage or patch could improve healing and limit scarring after hair transplants. **However, many peptide claims remain unproven in-vivo in humans, especially regarding their regenerative properties.**\n\n# Peptides\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98y67fxscyad1.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f64becde16773f4978c5b8e542bf8e886a0cc48f\n\nPeptides are short chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. In the world of biochemistry, they act as signaling molecules that communicate with our cells to perform various functions. Because of this, they have a broad range of applications in skincare, wound healing, and potentially, hair growth. Peptides can be classified based on their size and the complexity of their amino acid chains. Generally, they are categorized into oligopeptides, which are short chains consisting of 2 to 20 amino acids, and polypeptides, which are longer chains containing more than 20 amino acids. These distinctions are significant because the size and structure of peptides influence their stability, bioavailability, and their ability to penetrate the skin and interact with cells. Some peptides may consist of a single chain of amino acids, while others, like those in larger proteins, might have multiple chains that form more complex structures. When it comes to hair health, peptides may stimulate hair follicles, improve scalp condition, and possibly help mitigate the damaging effects of DHT.  \n  \n  \nIn skincare, peptides are celebrated for their ability to boost collagen production, enhance skin elasticity, and promote overall skin vitality.   \n  \nAccording to the review article title, \"Role of topical peptides in preventing or treating aged skin\" by F. Gorouhi and H. I. Maibach peptides are widely used in cosmetic dermatology to combat the signs of aging. The authors categorize peptides into four main groups: signal peptides, enzyme-inhibitor peptides, neurotransmitter-inhibitor peptides, and carrier peptides. They discuss that signal peptides, for example, stimulate the production of collagen and other matrix proteins, leading to firmer and more youthful skin. The review highlights various studies demonstrating the efficacy of these peptides in improving skin appearance and treating the signs of aging.   \n  \nOne notable finding from the article is the efficacy of Palmitoyl pentapeptide-4, which is a synthetic signal peptide derived from pro-collagen. Gorouhi and Maibach point to a paper by researchers Robinson et al. where it was observed that \"Palmitoyl pentapeptide provides significant improvements in the appearance of aging skin, with better scores in reducing fine lines and wrinkles compared to placebo\". The authors also mention Palmitoyl tripeptide-3/5, also known as SynÒ-Coll, which is a man-made ingredient that copies a part of a natural protein called thrombospondin 1.   \n  \nNormally, thrombospondin 1 helps control a protein in our body called tissue growth factor beta also known as TGF-beta which can cause skin problems like inflammation and wrinkles when it's too active. By working in a similar way to thrombospondin 1, SynÒ-Coll helps activate TGF-beta at the right levels, which boosts collagen production. More collagen means healthier, firmer skin with fewer wrinkles.\n\n\n\n# Glycosaminoglycans\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k2h6e73byad1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=56653428998656d78f764e2a008d2def1a763921\n\nThere was a mention about a peptide in this paper that had briefly caught my eye and it was about glycosaminoglycans. Before I bring this peptide up, I should first note that glycosaminoglycans, also known as mucopolysaccharides, are a type of sugar molecule found throughout the body. \n\nThey are made up of repeating sugar pairs and play various roles depending on their specific chemical makeup. Gorouhi and Maibach mention that Tripeptide-1 have been combined with palmitic acid to create pal-tripeptide-1, also known as Biopeptide-CL. Research done both in vitro and in vivo has shown that Biopeptide-CL helps stimulate the production of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, which are important for maintaining healthy skin. \n\nHowever, it's also important for healthy hair. This is where the mentioning of glycosaminoglycans caught my eye. Minoxidil, commonly used for hair growth, has a notable effect on the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans such as ***heparan sulfate, partially oversulfated chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid*** in the extracellular matrix around hair follicles. \n\nThis action supports a better environment for hair growth by enhancing the scaffolding where hair follicles reside. The study  \"Sulfation of Minoxidil in Keratinocytes and Hair Follicles and the Stimulatory Effect of Minoxidil on the Biosynthesis of Glycosaminoglycans\", by Y. Mori, T. Hamamoto, and S. Otomo found that minoxidil undergoes sulfation in hair follicles and proliferating keratinocytes, which is a key step in its mode of action. This process not only enhances glycosaminoglycans production in these cells but also shows minoxidil’s role goes beyond merely improving blood flow to the hair follicles, indicating a direct and multifaceted influence on hair growth mechanisms. \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1jspgo2eyad1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbf1e9fdeaa1f6499a6b6a986a0ad22a58575d3\n\nLooking at the review that Gorouhi and Maibach did, they note that combining Tripeptide-1 with palmitic acid forms pal-tripeptide-1, also known as Biopeptide-CL, which has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, crucial for maintaining healthy skin.   \n  \nIntegrating this with a sulfotransferase booster like tretinoin, which enhances minoxidil’s efficacy as noted in Hyo Seung Shin et al. in the study titled, \"Efficacy of 5% minoxidil versus combined 5% minoxidil and 0.01% tretinoin for male pattern hair loss: a randomized, double-blind, comparative clinical trial\" , could potentially further augment the skin and hair follicle environment in a super enhanced state of growth. My thinking is that while tretinoin boosts sulfotransferase activity, enhancing minoxidil’s effectiveness, the addition of Biopeptide-CL could simultaneously boost glycosaminoglycan levels. This combination might provide a more robust approach to promoting more effective hair growth by reinforcing the structural matrix around hair follicles.\n\nMoreover, the review highlights the challenges peptides face in terms of skin permeability. I think this is an important topic to cover in the next section before we move on to discussing any specific peptides and their potential roles in skincare and or hair loss.\n\n\n\n# The Dalton Rule and Molecular Size  AND  Peptides Tend to Be Hydrophilic\n\nTo grasp this challenge, it's important to understand the Dalton Rule. According to Bos and Meinardi in their paper \"The 500 Dalton Rule for the Skin Penetration of Chemical Compounds and Drugs,\" this guideline indicates that for a molecule to penetrate the skin effectively, its molecular weight should generally be less than 500 Daltons. Most peptides, composed of multiple amino acids, often exceed this size. Their large molecular weight typically places them above the 500 Dalton threshold, significantly limiting their ability to move through the skin barrier efficiently.\n\nIn addition to their size, peptides are typically hydrophilic, meaning they have an affinity for water. The skin, particularly its outermost layer—the stratum corneum—is designed to be a protective barrier composed of dead keratinized cells embedded in a lipid-rich matrix, which is lipophilic. Hydrophilic molecules, like most peptides, struggle to penetrate this lipophilic barrier. The stratum corneum’s lipophilic nature favors the absorption of fat-soluble substances over water-soluble ones.\n\n# Improving Transdermal Delivery Using Carriers in Solutions or Gels\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jeoggiw6dyad1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdbd475845ef679e85d6799ed539edb00784243f\n\nTo effectively apply most peptides to the skin, enhanced delivery methods are necessary. Gorouhi and Maibach discuss several approaches in their article, including chemical penetration enhancers. These substances, such as alcohols, fatty acids, and surfactants, can temporarily disrupt the lipid structure of the stratum corneum, increasing its permeability and allowing hydrophilic peptides to pass through more effectively.\n\nOne notable enhancer is Palmitoyl Derivatives of Interferon alpha. These derivatives increase the lipophilic properties of peptides. The palmitoyl derivative of the polypeptide interferon alpha can penetrate human skin five to six times more effectively than the peptide alone. This process, known as \"palmitoylation,\" involves attaching palmitoyl groups to peptides or proteins, significantly enhancing their lipophilicity and facilitating better penetration through the lipophilic layers of the skin.\n\nAnother advanced technique is the liposomal delivery system, where peptides are encapsulated within liposomes—small, spherical vesicles composed of phospholipids. This method improves the stability of the peptides and enhances their penetration, making the delivery system particularly effective for topical applications. The lipophilic outer layer of the liposome interacts favorably with the lipid-rich layers of the skin, effectively delivering hydrophilic substances like peptides.\n\nNanotechnology and nano-carrier systems also show promise for peptide delivery. These systems can encapsulate peptides within nanoparticles, significantly increasing their stability and facilitating their transport through the skin barrier. This approach is especially beneficial for larger peptide molecules, which typically face challenges in penetrating the skin on their own. Nano-carriers create a more stable and controlled environment for peptides, ensuring they can reach their target sites more effectively.\n\n\n\n# Improving Transdermal Delivery using Soundwaves and Electricity\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfrvbv7zayad1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=21f1609817f39d95b88538290cf111e6d70015c2\n\nI found Gorouhi and Maibach's discussion on the use of iontophoresis and sonophoresis to enhance peptide delivery especially interesting. Iontophoresis works by applying a small electric current that drives charged molecules through the skin, capitalizing on the repulsion between like charges to promote the movement of ions. \n\nThis method is effective for the rapid delivery of both charged and neutral molecules. In contrast, sonophoresis uses ultrasound waves to increase the skin's permeability by temporarily disrupting the lipid matrix in the stratum corneum. This disruption allows for the more efficient transport of hydrophilic substances, including peptides, across the skin barrier. \n\nI did some digging around at a university near me and I found a study a study conducted by researchers from Montclair State University, titled  \"Enhanced Transdermal Drug Delivery by Sonophoresis and Simultaneous Application of Sonophoresis and Iontophoresis,\" by Juhyun Park and colleagues. The research explores the combined use of sonophoresis and iontophoresis for improving the penetration of cosmeceutical drugs through the skin. \n\nIn this study, researchers used porcine skin, which was chosen due to its similarity to human skin in terms of structure and permeability. This in vitro model allowed for a controlled investigation into how these physical methods could improve skin permeability for different types of drugs.\n\nThe study found that using ultrasound waves which would be sonophoresis and electric fields which would be the use of  iontophoresis. When using these two forces together, it significantly enhanced the skin permeability compared to using either method alone. \n\nSpecifically, the application of sonophoresis increased the skin penetration of niacinamide and retinol by 402% and 292%, respectively, illustrating its substantial effect on enhancing drug delivery across the skin barrier.\n\nThe porcine dorsal skin used in the experiments was sourced freshly and stored at -80°C until it was needed. Before each experiment, the skin was thawed at room temperature. \n\nThe integrity of the skin was carefully verified using a fluorescein application method. It involved applying fluorescein and using a spectrofluorophotometer to measure the fluorescence signal.  A spectrofluorophotometer is a very sophisticated analytical instrument used to measure the intensity and wavelength distribution of fluorescent light emitted by a sample. So, when a sample is exposed to light at some wavelength, a portion of its molecules absorb this light and then re-emit it at a longer wavelength. This emitted light is known as fluorescence.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as10n0iuiyad1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b37ccfa62d4e0fa21930a9449670bee3d87c26c\n\nThis tool is important in the context of a transdermal drug delivery study because a might be used to verify the integrity of skin samples. For example, after applying fluorescein - which is what we call a fluorescent dye - the instrument measures the emitted light to confirm whether the dye has penetrated the skin.\n\nSo, in this experiment, the skin samples that do not show high fluorescence - which would indicate no penetration of the dye - are considered intact and suitable for further experiments.\n\nFor the experimental setup, the researchers applied different formulations of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs onto the porcine skin. \n\nThe treated skin was then exposed to either sonophoresis, iontophoresis, or a combination of both. Sonophoresis involved applying ultrasound waves at two different frequencies (so, there were between 280 Kilohertz and 350 Kilohertz) with varying intensity levels, while iontophoresis utilized current densities of 100, 150, and 200 microampere  per square-centimeter.\n\nThe simultaneous application involved using both ultrasound and electric current together. After treating the skin with the respective methods, it was mounted on Franz diffusion cells, a standard apparatus for studying drug permeation through the skin. The receiver chamber of the diffusion cell was filled with phosphate-buffered saline also known as PBS. For a solution of PBS with 0.5% Polysorbate-80 for hydrophobic drugs. The donor chamber contained 300 µL of the drug formulation.\n\nSamples from the receiver chamber were collected at intervals of 3, 5, and 24 hours post-application to measure the amount of drug that had penetrated through the skin. These samples were then analyzed using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  equipped with a UV/Vis detector to quantify the concentration of the drugs.\n\nThe key findings of the study indicated significant enhancements in the skin penetration of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs when treated with sonophoresis. For instance, the hydrophilic drugs like niacinamide and arbutin showed substantial increases in penetration, and similar enhancements were observed for hydrophobic drugs such as retinol and alpha-bisabolol. Notably, the combined application of sonophoresis and iontophoresis resulted in the most significant enhancement in skin permeability, especially for the model drug glutamic acid.\n\nThis is particularly important because the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin, presents a significant barrier to transdermal drug delivery. Overcoming this barrier effectively can allow for non-invasive and convenient drug administration methods. \n\nSo, this method would help with hydrophilic substances like Peptides and also be a great alternative to microneedling.  \n\n# Companies working on Peptide Hair Growth Stimulants\n\nFirstly, Follicum did so with the injection of peptide FOL-005 which stands as a derivative to the peptide Osteopontin. It seems that they have had minor success in this route which has led Follicum to come up with a topical peptide gel that, so far, seems to be somewhat promising. Although, I must admit I am slightly discouraged by Follicum’s poor marketing and deceptive fear mongering against finasteride and other treatments. Also, they’ve resorted to taking the cosmetic route. So, not saying that it won’t work, but definitely be on the lookout. \n\n\n\n[This is horrible. They're saying Oral Pyrilutamide is safer than Oral Finasteride??? ](https://preview.redd.it/uxaiw9yciyad1.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a0f5d7c3f1be88f940f8b21ce0eec6eafb9badd)\n\nSecondly, Amplifica is currently in the process of injecting human subjects with potentially a derivative of either Osteopontin or Osteopontin itself. \n\nFurthermore, Doctor. Maksim Plikus, another co-founder of Amplifica and the Chief Scientific Officer at Amplifica mentioned the potential for injections of this peptide potential service the purpose similar to botox, where every six months people would go into a clinic in order to received injects of their peptide growth stimulant. These injections, for what it's worth, have worked so far in mice test subjects. However, I think we’ll see some promise in the human clinical trials. \n\n# BPC-157\n\nNow, I tried looking through the literature on Google Scholar and various databases to find studies that looked at Body Protection Compound 157, also known as BPC-157, for treating androgenetic alopecia or any hair loss conditions in humans. I think the allure of this compound is in its potential to treat damaged tissues and regenerate them. \n\nMost of this, however, seems to have been demonstrated on mice. For example, in the study by Gwyer et al. titled \"Gastric pentadecapeptide body protection compound BPC 157 and its role in accelerating musculoskeletal soft tissue healing,\" published in 2019, the authors critically review the use of BPC 157 as a potential therapy for healing soft tissue damage with a focus on tendon, ligament, and skeletal muscle healing. \n\nThe researchers focused on various animal studies, particularly rodent models, that demonstrated the effects of BPC 157 on tissue repair. These studies consistently showed that BPC 157 could accelerate the healing processes in tissues damaged by trauma or disease, by mechanisms that include promoting angiogenesis and enhancing the survival and migration of fibroblasts. These cells are crucial for the repair and regeneration of connective tissues, and the activation of the FAK-paxillin pathway, which the review discusses, is essential for cellular movement and attachment, both key to tissue regeneration.\n\nDespite these promising results in animal models, the review critically highlights a significant gap: the translation of these findings to human clinical applications. To date, the efficacy and safety of BPC 157 in human subjects remain untested and unconfirmed, which means its clinical use in human tissue healing is still not established. This lack of human trials is a major limitation and an area that the study stresses needs further exploration.\n\nGwyer and colleagues suggest that future research should not only continue in larger animal models but also advance into human clinical trials. This step is crucial for determining whether the positive outcomes observed in simpler biological systems can be replicated in the more complex human physiology. The review also notes that much of the research on BPC 157 has been concentrated within a few research groups, which may limit the breadth of the findings and their generalizability.\n\nI don’t believe that simply applying BPC-157 to the scalp, whether in a topical solution, cream, or through injections, would directly stimulate hair growth or rejuvenate hair follicles. However, it’s essential to reflect on the significant breakthrough in scarless healing achieved through the use of YAP inhibitors, particularly Verteporfin, which has garnered attention in the hair transplant community.\n\n# Verteporfin and BPC-157\n\n[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba2374](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba2374) \n\nFor those needing a refresher, Verteporfin is a drug that can prevent scarring when injected at the edge of a wound. This drug, already FDA-approved for treating macular degeneration, works by blocking Engrailed-1 (En1) activation in fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting scar formation. The groundbreaking research on Verteporfin’s role in scar prevention was led by Stanford MD-PhD student Shamik Mascharak and his team, as detailed in their study titled \"Preventing Engrailed-1 activation in fibroblasts yields wound regeneration without scarring\".\n\nIn their study, the researchers injected Verteporfin to surgical wounds in mice while simultaneously applying mechanical strain to the healing tissues. The results were remarkable, with the healed skin appearing completely normal, devoid of the dense, fibrotic scarring typically seen in wound healing. This discovery underscores the potential of Verteporfin not only in preventing scarring but also in promoting regenerative healing processes that could have profound implications for various medical fields, including hair transplantation.\n\n[https://community.tressless.com/t/verteporfin-and-microneedling/312](https://community.tressless.com/t/verteporfin-and-microneedling/312) \n\nMoreover, the paper “Inhibiting Yes-associated protein prevents scarring and promotes regeneration in a large animal model of wound repair,” Heather E. Talbott and colleagues demonstrated that a single local administration of Verteporfin following injury significantly reduced scarring and induced regenerative healing in red Duroc pigs. Notably, these pigs are a close analog to human skin in terms of thickness and are often used in dermatological research, making the findings particularly relevant. The successful regeneration of scarless skin and hair follicles in these pigs points to the potential of Verteporfin to prevent scarring and regenerate hair follicles in humans as well.\n\n# KPV\n\nLysine-proline-valine also known as KPV \n\nLysine-proline-valine, abbreviated as KPV, is a small peptide composed of the amino acids lysine, proline, and valine. Some of these amino acids are naturally occurring in the body and can be obtained through dietary intake. For instance, Lysine is an essential amino acid that must be consumed in diet, while proline and valine can be synthesized by the body and are also found in various protein-rich foods.\n\nDespite the presence of these amino acids in the body and through diet, the specific structure of the KPV peptide matters because it combines these amino acids in a sequence that confers unique biological activities. \n\nYou see, when amino acids form peptides, their functions can change significantly compared to when they are present individually. In the case of KPV, this particular combination exhibits anti-inflammatory properties that aren't necessarily seen with the amino acids alone.\n\nNow, it seems like recently on the internet that KPV is gaining attention for its potential benefits for not only skin health but also hair health particularly in addressing conditions like hair loss and androgenetic alopecia. \n\nHowever, none of this information is new. In fact, I noticed a trend among some novel peptides and how some of them either have their use case patented or the peptide itself patented. I saw a similar instance with Amplifica’s Osteopontin injection protocol for hair growth stimulation and rejuvenation.\n\nSo, I decided to do some quick digging to see if the same would be true with KPV and hair loss. And it didn’t matter for me which kind of hair loss because I mostly wanted to see if KPV was even used in that domain. But, to my surprise and amazement, it turns out there was a patent that involved KPV and treating androgenetic alopecia. And it was filed by none other than L’Oreal. So, let’s take a look.\n\n[https://patents.google.com/patent/US6001812A/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6001812A/en) \n\n[https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1f/7e/e3/c7afa246a908e2/US6001812.pdf](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1f/7e/e3/c7afa246a908e2/US6001812.pdf) \n\nUnited States Patent number 6,001,812, titled  \"Modulating Body/Cranial Hair Growth with Derivatives of the C-Type Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone,\", was granted to inventor Yann Mahe and is assigned to Societe L'Oreal S.A. The patent was filed on January 23, 1998, and was officially issued on December 14, 1999. This patent, which has since expired, presents a significant advancement in the field of hair growth regulation.\n\nThe core innovation of this patent lies in the discovery that peptides sequence contains the Lysine-Proline-Valine also known as KPV, or their functional biological equivalents, can be effectively used to stimulate or induce the growth of body and cranial hair. These peptides, derived from or mimicking the C-type melanocyte-stimulating hormone also known as C-MSH, are described as potent agents in promoting hair growth and preventing hair loss. \n\nThe C-MSH is a neuropeptide known for its various roles, including its anti-inflammatory and pigmentation-promoting activities, and is naturally present in the human body.\n\nThe patent outlines that these peptides, specifically those excluding sequences where Lysine-Proline-Valine is immediately preceded by a Histidine residue, can extend the anagen phase of the hair cycle. The anagen phase is the active growth phase where the hair follicle is producing new cells, resulting in hair elongation. By prolonging this phase, the peptides effectively delay the transition to the telogen resting phase, thereby reducing the frequency of hair loss cycles and promoting a fuller head of hair.\n\nNow, the application of these peptides in hair growth compositions is broad. The patent mentions how KPV may be useful for treating various types of alopecia, including androgenetic alopecia, which is characterized by a progressive thinning of the hair and is commonly seen in genetically predisposed individuals. \n\nThe patent also suggests that these peptides could be beneficial in managing other hair disorders, including those with an inflammatory component. Inflammatory stages of alopecia are marked by elevated levels of mediators such as cytokines and prostaglandins, which the peptides can help regulate, thus mitigating hair loss and promoting regrowth.\n\nBeyond the specific KPV sequence, the patent also explores the potential of using these peptides in combination with other known hair growth agents. These include minoxidil, a well-known hair growth stimulant, and various anti-inflammatory compounds, anti-androgens, and other biologically active substances that can further enhance the hair growth-promoting effects of the peptides.\n\nSo, this peptide at one point in time seemed to have some promise as both an anti-inflammatory hair growth stimulant. I think this speaks to my earlier point about focusing on the scalp’s skin health rather than directly on the hair follicle. \n\nThere must be studies that involve KPV and the treatment of dermatological conditions based in inflammation and perhaps in hair loss. My attention is exclusively focused on androgenetic alopecia, however, any dermatological condition and its improvement would be beneficial to the potential use of KPV topically on the scalp. \n\n# Timestamps:\n\n00:00:25 Introduction\n\n00:01:18 What are Peptides?\n\n00:08:43 Challenge 1: The Dalton Rule and Molecular Size\n\n00:09:37 Challenge 2: Peptides Tend to Be Hydrophilic\n\n00:12:53 Improving Transdermal Delivery using Soundwaves and Electricity\n\n00:21:15 Amplifica Injections\n\n00:32:54 What about the use of other peptides? \n\n00:35:41 BPC-157 aka Body Protection Compound 157\n\n00:38:49 Verteporfin and BPC-157\n\n00:45:04 GHK-Cu Copper Peptide\n\n01:01:01 Copper Peptide’s Alzheimer’s Disease Connection\n\n01:19:03 Inflammatory Aspect of Hair Loss\n\n01:28:13 Thymosin Beta-4 (also known as TB-500)\n\n01:34:27 Could Peptides Help Restore Damaged Arrector Pili Muscles?\n\n01:45:43 Commentary\n\n \n\nBONUS SECTION: Skin care\n\n0:1:47:42 Argireline (Acetyl hexapeptide-3)\n\n01:52:29 Leuphasyl\n\n01:55:25 IGF-1 Peptides on Collagen\n\n",

Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is **sorted by price per ounce** so you can shop within your budget! (Price update in progress - April 2023.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome! Please let me know of any products I can add or anything on the list that has been discontinued.\n\n**Moisturizers without SPF**\n\n**Name** | **Packaging** | **ROUGH cost per oz in US** | **Notes**\n:- | :- | :- | :-\nQV Skin Lotion | pump | $0.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Cream | pump | $0.75 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nQV Baby Moisturising Cream | tub & pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nATTITUDE Extra Gentle Daily Moisturizing Natural Body Lotion | pump | $1 | \nEthique Gentle Hand and Body Lotion Concentrate | concentrate | $1 | price is based on volume after adding water\nQV Intensive Cream | pump | $1 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nBambo Nature Snuggle Time Body Lotion | tube | $1 |\nDesert Essence Hand and Body Lotion, Fragrance Free | tube | $1.25 | contains sunflower oil\nQV Baby Skin Lotion | tub & pump | $1.25 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nCeramedx Restoring Body Lotion | pump | $1.50 | contains safflower and sunflower oil\nYes to Avocado Fragrance-Free Daily Hand Cream | tube | $1.75 |\nShiKai Borage Therapy Lotion (Original Formula, Advanced Formula, or Children’s Formula) | pump | $1.75-$2 | contains safflower oil\nACURE Everyday Eczema Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nACURE Seriously Soothing 24hr Moisture Lotion | tube | $1.75 | contains safflower and sunflower oils\nOrganic Fiji Nourishing Lotion with Organic Coconut Oil Fragrance Free | pump | $1.75 | contains sunflower oil\nPipette Baby Lotion | tube | $1.75 | \nCocokind Sake Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil\nDrunk Elephant Sili Body Lotion | pump | $2 | contains sunflower oil, banana extract; parent company is not cruelty-free\nPipette Babykrav Oil | bottle | $2 | contains sunflower lecithin\nPure Anada Hand & Body Lotion - Unscented | pump | C$2 | contains sunflower oil\nAcne.org moisturizer | pump | $2 | may cause discoloration on pale skin\nQV Hand Cream | tube | $2.50 | Australian; parent company is not cruelty-free\nThe Seaweed Bath Co.

    "body": "I recently had yet another Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner dry out on me and in my frustration, began the google search for how to rehydrate it. I found a lot of suggestions, which I will review below, but none of them involved replacing the ingredient that had actually evaporated. Here is the ingredients list:\n\n\nIsododecane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyethylene, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Lecithin, Phenyl Trimethicone, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Methicone, Barium Sulfate, BHT, Phenoxyethanol. May contain: Iron Oxides, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Blue 1 Lake, Carmine, Chromium Oxide Greens, Manganese Violet, Yellow 5 Lake, Chromium Hydroxide Green, Bismuth Oxychloride, Ultramarines, Ferric Ferrocyanide\n\n\nRestoration Methods:\n\n* Visine: Safe around the eyes, but uses water to rehydrate. As you can see, this product does not contain water, so adding water to reliquify it, while functional, does not actually recreate the formula. Of the recommendations I encountered, I think this (or another uncontaminated water-based product, like distilled water, saline solution -- do not use tap water, as it might contain microorganisms you really don't want near your eye!) is the best if you're not going to use cyclomethicones.\n* Glycerin: Similar to the water suggestion (glycerin is a humectant which absorbs water) this will be somewhat functional, but actually is less preferable to visine because glycerin may add a bit of a sticky/tacky sensation because it does not evaporate... rather it retains water :)\n* Microwave: This softens the product in a similar way that the microwave softens bread, but ultimately the formula is never the same and will be more drying long term by causing further evaporation.\n* Oil: This will remove the long-wear and stay in place aspects, making it smudgy and will never set... because oil does not evaporate.\n\n\nThe real magic is in the first two ingredients: Isododecane and Cyclopentasiloxane. The former is a solvent, while the latter is a volatile silicone that evaporates. While they sound obscure, you stand a good chance of already owning something that is composed of these ingredients!\n\n\nMakeup removers are good bet. Neutrogena's Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover and Walmart Equate's dupe are great budget options, especially as the cyclomethicone layer is floating on the top and separate from the water-based formula. /u/QualityLeaf wrote a [wonderful comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/3vm4v5/psa_restore_your_driedout_gel_eye_liner_or_eye/cxqtr30) with a photo demonstration -- thank you so much for that!\n\n\nYou might also have a silicone serum that is mainly composed of this product. For example, Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM. Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, Squalane, Retinol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Water (Aqua), Pentylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Lechitin, Bisabolol, Alcohol. This is what I used, and it works like a dream, but some may be sensitive to retinol.\n\nYou could also source a cyclomethicone in its pure form -- might come in handy for DIY!\n\nHow to actually apply the cyclomethicone to the product? Because the product I use comes in a dropper bottle, I literally just applied one drop to the top and let it sink in by itself. No mixing, easy as pie!\n\nHope this was helpful to someone :)",

    "body": "##Skincare\n\n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Multi-Peptide Anti-Aging Serum, 1 oz** - Light and breathable watery gel serum. Slightly runnier than other Skin Nutrition Botanicals serums. Does make skin pleasantly plump and bouncy. Not likely to be effective for dark spots despite claim as niacinamide and ascorbyl glucoside (vitamin C derivative) both likely below 1%. However, these ingredients may still provide slight barrier support and antioxidant benefits. \n* **Skin Nutrition Botanicals Tea Tree Oil + Salicylic Acid Balancing Face Wash, 4 oz** - A mild, non-drying face wash with two chemical exfoliants (is the AHA ingredient citric acid?), witch hazel and most interesting to me, tea tree oil. I’ve heard that tea tree oil can substitute for benzoyl peroxide (very effective, but bleached clothes) so I wanted to check this cleanser out. I think day and night use helped my mild acne not get worse. But does not eliminate acne like a leave on benzoyl peroxide cream (as expected). I needed to dial back on this cleanser as I began some other actives and my skin was getting dry. \n* **Global Beauty Care Smooth & Lift Collagen Skin Cream, 1.7 oz** - has squalane, a non-comedogenic oil, and peptides. Very pleasant, lightweight gel serum texture, just like the eye serum in the same line. Fragrance free. I’ve heard that collagen (hydrolyzed collagen) in skincare doesn’t do much. But I think this is a nice basic moisturizer for someone with oily or combination skin. \n\n##B Pure Lip Mask vs Aquaphor \n\n* **B Pure Hydrating Night Lip Mask** - Finally saw this super popular lip balm in stock! Immediate impression: surprised at the pink color of the balm (expected clear), and didn’t really care for the taste (like fruity crayon). Luckily the taste goes away. The texture is thick and did remind me of **Aquaphor Lip Protectant SPF 30**, which is a little thinner than the regular **Advanced Therapy Healing Ointment** (which can also be used for lips). \n\nI thought that the pink tint was so minimal as to be effectively colorless. But actually, comparing B Pure and the two Aquaphor (both clear) that I have side by side on my lips, a bit of pink tint does come through on my light color lips. As far as other observations, I think the B Pure is the best looking as it’s slightly glassier. And also somehow fills in all my lip lines. If you want a subtly pouty look, I think B Pure is a good choice. However if you want sheen but not gloss, I think the two Aquaphor is more subtle. The Aquaphor Advanced Therapy (large tube) is the least glossy, but also does the least when it comes to filling in lip lines. But does also contain soothing bisabolol (chamomile) where the other two doesn’t. \n\nOverall I still like Aquaphor Lip Protectant SPF 30 because it doesn’t have any taste at all and also has a high amount of sunscreen (most have spf 15). But it’s also $5-7 for 0.35 oz, and B Pure is $1.25 for the same 0.35 size (despite the larger looking tube). I still think the B Pure is the better looking cosmetic though. And does feel luxe on the lips. Give it a try!\n\n##Dental \n\n* **Guru Nanda Ultimate 2 in 1 Floss Picks Wild Mint, 40 count** - First of all, these floss picks don’t really have a taste. Secondly, the actual floss pick is a bit small. But the reason I got these picks was actually the soft rubber interdental pick on the end. Wow, what a great value. A pack of 60 count CVS brand soft picks is $6-7. Now, I haven’t tried any interdental pick before, so I don’t have any comparison. But the soft rubber tip here feels soft on the teeth while holding shape. The tapered end means it fits a bit smaller to larger gaps between teeth. The size is probably best for those with medium to large gaps in their teeth like I have. Using this interdental pick raised my gum line the next day. A bonus feature is I can break the pick in half to remove the floss pick side, so I can fit the pick to my back teeth. However, I don’t think the interdental pick is firm enough for the toughest spot behind my last molar. \n* **Guru Nanda Interdental Brushes Mint Flavor, 4 count, with cap** - This interdental pick is shorter than the 2 in 1 floss pick and also has a cap for storage. Says it can be used up to ten times. Doesn’t have a strong flavor either. The brush head is made of metal wire and can be bent to fit tougher spaces. The brush size is slimmer for medium gaps, not large. But it cannot fit the tightest spaces. The bristles feel stiffer, rougher, for a better clean, but does make me worried about abrasion over time. The metal wire is also poke-y pretty much like pipe cleaner for craft making. I don’t think I’ll get this again as despite its capacity to bend to shape, it’s still not firm enough for my back of the mouth spaces. And I’m concerned about the roughness on teeth. However, as I said I haven’t gotten interdental picks before, so I don’t know if the brush quality is standard. \n\n##Fragrance \n\n* **Power Stick Body Spray Paradise Breeze, 3.5 oz** - Fragrance notes are “black amber plum and vanilla woods.” The fragrance is really very different from the name. I expect “paradise breeze” to smell tropical. But it is accurate to the fragrance notes. Like a nighttime scent. Reminds me of **Bath and Body Works Into the Night**. A bit of mocha. But without the stronger and lasting wood notes. Also related to the plum notes of **Viva Vanilla**, but less sweet, less vanilla, and much less powerful (that one is a beast!). \n\nThe spray is powerful with butane and propane as propellants, perhaps similar to Axe body spray or the propellant of a can of whipped cream or WD-40. \n\nThe fragrance is there. It’s sufficient like Bath and Body Works’ milder body mists. But it doesn’t seem to project a lot and I mostly forget I’m wearing it. I also think the fragrance is just a bit musty. However it’s not bad at all and if you’re interested I say go for it. Pretty unique fragrance that does smell more expensive than its price point. I wanted it to be a Viva Vanilla dupe, and it isn’t. But I also don’t have anything like it. Not mad! \n\n##Which would I buy again?\n\nDefinitely the Guru Nanda 2 in 1 soft rubber picks. I also think the Skin Nutrition Botanicals multi peptide serum and cleanser are effective, well formulated products. I’m a fan of the Global Beauty Care collagen cream too, but usually look for moisturizers with niacinamide for hyperpigmentation benefit.\n\nI think the B Pure lip mask is a great value for those who don’t mind the taste, and want a subtly tinted, glossy, hydrating lip product that fills in lip lines. I do mind the taste, and I’m not pressed about appearance of my lip at night time, which is when I’d use this lip mask (using spf lip balm during the day). So it might be a one and done purchase for me. However, I think others will be pleasantly surprised! \n\nDon’t really like the high pressure propellant of the Power Stick body spray since I just spray on my wrists. But it would be a good buy for someone who wants to quickly douse their whole body head to toe in a light fragrance. \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "I had referenced this in a comment on another post, but thought everyone in this forum might be interested.\n\nI saw my dermatologist last week for what appears to be worsening alopecia areata. I asked if a contact allergy to a product could have triggered it, and she said no but mentioned that people can [report adverse reactions to the FDA](https://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/smarthub#/cosmetics), and if enough people do this it can lead to action! There was a shampoo made by WEN had a safety alert issued on it by the FDA due to making people's hair fall out several years back. I told her about my horrible reaction to SEEN shampoo and conditioner and mentioned that it appeared to have a strong fragrance even though it is labeled fragrance free.\n\nShe told me that companies in the US actually have a fragrance loophole. Apparently if they are using a fragrance-containing ingredient for a purpose OTHER than adding fragrance (like emulsification), they are allowed to include it AND still label the product fragrance free. Which is total BS. She said there was legislation passed recently to close this loophole and require companies to clearly label fragrance ingredients, but right now the industry is struggling with how to realistically implement this due to the very small real estate on most product labels.\n\nHere is [more detailed information about the law](https://www.mariegale.com/fragrance-allergen-regulations/) if you are curious. Sounds like it will be a while before we see this impact products on the shelf (2028 at the earliest). The article also references another post that includes a list of fragrance allergens which companies will be required to disclose- [that post is here](https://www.mariegale.com/fragrance-allergens/) if you are looking for a list to reference.\n\nIt's good to know the law has been changed and there will be more transparency coming. There is nothing that frustrates me more than when a product is marketed as being fragrance free, but actually ends up containing essential oils or other fragrance compounds. Hope this helps others to know about too.\n\nEDIT: For anyone who has had a reaction to SEEN- please report it also. I actually suspect the bisabolol (mentioned by another user here in a different post). [According to this](https://cannahorse.com/blogs/terpenes/terpenes-bisabolol?srsltid=AfmBOoojcip_eeTziEAihLwGcA7UF9mHdjHKFHKkokgbxCHmJe4hRa7P), bisabolol is definitely a terpene that has fragrance, but I don't see it on the fragrance allergen list referenced above. :-(\n\nEDIT #2: I dug more deeply into that post and found that bisabolol is indeed a fragrance compound commonly used in perfume. You have to click on the spreadsheet that lists all the plant compounds and it is right there. It makes me just furious. Think of how careless a choice that is. Who decided that? “Yeah, it’s a perfume ingredient, but screw it- let’s use it anyhow in this FF product!” 🤬",

Every product is absolutely STUFFED FULL with actives that work well together.\n\nAnyways, this post is just [pictures](https://imgur.com/a/UGWJwVS) and first impressions for now, but I will update after I use them up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I'm a picky ass potato so my IDEAL skincare products have to be:**\n\n\\- Show visible results or at least have scientifically proven ingredients at effective %s\n\n\\- Fragrance-free\n\n\\- Have as many high-quality actives/goodies as possible in one product bc I ain't got time nor energy NOR MONEY for a 15 step routine\n\n\\- Created by knowledgeable experts aka scientists in labs\n\n\\- Have packaging that doesn't annoy me/look decent on my bathroom counter.\n\n\\- Cosmetically elegant!! I can't use a product no matter how good it is if it's just gonna roll off my face! I also hate sticky. =\\^(\n\n\\- Not exorbitantly priced\n\n# And guess freakin' what? This brand. Checks. Out. Every. Single. DIF#@R#3resfs$%#ty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# LEVEL (serum)\n\n**- 5%** [**Niacinamide**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide)\n\n(5% is really all you need to get benefits from this brightening, barrier-enhancing power ingredient. Anything more = potential irritation.)\n\n**- 2%** [**N-Acetyl Glucosamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acetyl-glucosamine)\n\n(Works synergistically with niacinamide, skin-lightening)\n\n**- 3%** **Tranexamic Acid**\n\n(***Y'ALL THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL MY LIFE???*** This is a very effective spot-reducing ingredient, not enough evidence yet but the research is super promising - 3-5% of this topically has been shown to be just as effective as hydroquinone at skin-lightening but without the irritation & any shady business like ochronosis!)\n\n*(the only other products with this known amount are Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense at $98/1 oz/30 mL bottle, and Dr. Brandt's Dark Spots No More at $68/0.5 oz/15 mL a bottle.)*\n\n**- 2%** [**Alpha Arbutin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/alpha-arbutin)\n\n**- 2%** [**Undecoylenoyl Phenylalanine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/undecylenoyl-phenylalanine)\n\n**-  Standardized Salicylates**\n\n**- 1% Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate**\n\n(anti-inflammatory, soothing part of licorice root)\n\n\\- **1%** [**Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane)\n\n(antioxidant from tumeric, skin-brightening and soothing.)\n\n**-  0.5%** [**Hexylresorcinol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hexylresorcinol)\n\n\\- A thin, watery formula with little bubbles. Spreads and absorbs easily, super lightweight.\n\n\\- SO. MANY. LIGHTENING. INGREDIENTS. I have NEVER seen all of these together in one bottle. My jaw dropped when I saw it tbh. More importantly, at the most effective percentages!!\n\n\\- Am weirdly pleased with the inclusion of [dimethyl isosorbide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethyl-isosorbide) in their products.\n\nI DIY, and I found this solvent to be the most lightweight, non-sticky (damn you glycols!!), effective, and I believe in its penetration-enhancing powers. This ingredient is super duper expensive compared to glycols.. D; You'll usually see it only in high-end skincare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X (serum)\n\n\\-  Antioxidant complex: **DMC-HMC-TRes-Quer-Gen-FA-EGCG-α,β,γ,δ-Toc2-SIl-LAA**\n\n(I won't pretend to know what this is but I will break down some below:)\n\n**-**  [**Ascorbic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ascorbic-acid)\n\n(most effective, OG version of vitamin C! Looks like there's a lot in here.)\n\n**-  Acetyl Zingerone**\n\n**-** [**Tocopherol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol)\n\n(vitamin e - works synergistically with vitamin C)\n\n**-** [**ECGC**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/epigallocatechin-gallate)\n\n(super potent antioxidant from green tea!)\n\n**-** [**Ferulic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ferulic-acid)\n\n(the gangs are all here - together with Vitamin C & E, this *kills* it in protecting your skin from sun damage and pollution.)\n\n**-** [**Resveratrol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/resveratrol)\n\n(Another super powerful antioxidant, this time from grapes. Even paula's choice, who don't believe that hard in antioxidants being 100% effective believes in this one according to an article of theirs I read.)\n\n**-**  [**Genistein**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/genistein)\n\n(antioxidant from soybeans)\n\n**-**  [**Quercetin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/quercetin)\n\n(antioxidant from things like broccoli, blueberries, red onions, supposed to be very soothing too)\n\n**-** [**Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hesperidin-methyl-chalcone) (never heard of it, but supposedly very anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.)\n\n**-** [**Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethylmethoxy-chromanol) (another super potent antioxidant)\n\n\\-  **pH 3.0**\n\n\\- I mean,,, with this wonderful mess, do I really need another Skinceuticals vitamin c serum copycat?\n\n\\- The packaging is opaque, which protects the antioxidants inside, and the pump is super easy to use- Light orange in color, smells ultra lightly of something fresh/fruity..\n\n\\- Watery, also very light. Absorbs quickly.- I've only used this for several days now so I can't comment on efficacy yet, but so far, it gives me a nice glow after using it.\n\nCompared to Timeless vitamin C E F serum, it's more subtle. Timeless makes my skin like,, REFLECTIVE. (Timeless also helps reduce pore-enlargement and rough skin texture caused by lack of sleep if I use it at night too.)\n\nI actually prefer the glow from this rather than the Timeless tbh, because it looks more natural, glowing-from-within and not super shiny looking.\n\n\\- It would be nice to know the percentages in this as well.\n\n\\- Related: YES I DO see a difference in using an antioxidant/vitamin C serum on my dark spots/tanning especially in the summer! It makes them fade faster VS using sunscreen alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE (serum)\n\n**- 5%** [**Glycerin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin)\n\n(the best humectant the world has to offer. Truly.)\n\n**- 5%** [**Urea**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea)\n\n(I. Have. Been. Looking. For. 5% Urea product without fragrance for **SO. LONG**. I think I went through the entire internet. But like [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) says, urea is basically the most underrated ingredient for barrier repair. My dry ass face NEEDS this.)\n\n**- 5%** [**Hydroxyethyl Urea**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea)\n\n(Similar to just plain urea, not sure 100% the difference. I guess it's a bit less exfoliating and has more humectant properties.)\n\n\\- **1% Multimolecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid + 5% HA Crosspolymer**\n\n**- 5%** [**Betaine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/betaine)\n\n\\- **0.5% Pentacyclic Terpenes from Centella Asiatica**\n\n( *Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid* )\n\n**- NMFs like amino acids, sugars, etc.**\n\n>[***Natural moisturizing factor***](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/glossary/natural-moisturizing-factor/) ***(NMF)*** *is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%), and a few other things.*  \n>  \n>*Susan from Swift Crafty Monkey*\n\n\\- Has a light gel consistency, kinda cloudy clear in color. Thicker than LEVEL or VITAMIN X. Little goes a long way. Only need one pump for my whole face.\n\n\\- Holy crap, this is sooooo nice??? Idk if it's this that's doing it or the C.R.E.A.M., or both, but my disgustingly dry skin feels sufficiently moisturized!! Shocked.\n\n\\- This is my dream-come true hydrator?? It literally has everything your skin needs to draw water to it & be healthy. It kind of reminds me of Hada Labo Premium Lotion? But I personally find this even better.\n\nI'm also satisfied with the level of exfoliation the 5% urea gives, so I don't feel the need to add extra acids for my sensitive skin. I have skin that's intolerant to AHAs anyways... (But The Inkey List 3% PHA toner has been nice! It doesn't sting whatsoever.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M. (moisturizer)\n\n\\-  **2% Ceramides** in a **3:1:1:1** ratio\n\n(Very important!!! Ceramides not in the right ratio can actually be harmful to your skin. The vast majority of products out there with ceramides apparently [don't have much in them](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/). I've been lusting after Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Restore cream for so long, but put off by its $128 price tag and essential oils - peppermint??? why - and other fragrant components.)\n\n\\-  **2% Isosorbide Dicaprylate + 2% Glycerin + 2% Glyceryl Glucoside**\n\n**-**  [**Squalane**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/squalane) **and Triglycerides**\n\n\\-   **2% Ursolic Acid Liposomes**\n\n\\-  **1% Bisabolol**\n\n(The soothing, healing component from chamomile.)\n\n\\- Shoot, this got errything. Ceramides, linoleic acid, squalane, and other stuff I've never heard of, but I'll trust that the formulators know what they're doing. Absolutely beautiful.\n\n\\- You can see the texture [here](https://imgur.com/a/UGWJwVS). It's a pretty thick cream. It's very, very nourishing and I love it??? I have to use it longer, and test it under different conditions, but so far I can't stop touching my face bc it feels SO soft. Oily skinned people may find this too moisturizing? Not sure.\n\n\\- I absolutely SLATHER my face is HUGE dollops of Aveeno Eczema Healing Cream (with Eucerin 5% Urea cream underneath) and top that with a good amount of the balm version of that in order to not wake up to dry, tight face. I've been testing this by itself, but two pumps instead of one like in the morning, and surprisingly my skin doesn't feel tight!!\n\nI was worried this wouldn't be enough, but it is! I'm gonna test it with the Aveeno balm to see if I get even better results. - Um, too early I know, but I feel like I found my HG moisturizer..?\n\n\\- I want this in giant buckets. Thnx.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA (cleanser)\n\n\\- **Stabilized Surfactant structures** formulated to be **barrier-safe**\n\n\\-  **Amino Acid-based surfactants**\n\n\\- **10% Glycerin**\n\n\\- **5% Betaine**\n\n\\-  **pH 5.3-5.5**\n\n\\- Woow that's a lot of glycerin. You only need a small dollop and it lathers into a thick, rich foam. Not big, fluffy bubbles but small, rich bubbles. Very nice.\n\n\\- Smells strange.. I can't really place it.. maybe like,, sour glue? It's not so strong that it bothers me a whole lot. It's a fantastic cleanser for my dry skin and I'm just glad that it's fragrance-free.\n\n\\- After washing, my face doesn't feel tight. At all. In fact, it feels *moist.* M O I S T\n\nIt washes off cleanly though, I don't feel like there's a film left behind. This has not dried out my skin after several days of using it in a row 2x a day, like some cleansers do even if they don't dry me out initially.\n\n\\- I would like this in a bigger bottle, preferably in a pump! I don't like squeezy tubes bc water ALWAYS gets in the cap in the shower.\n\n\\- I am impressed, and this is the best cleanser I have tried for my dry skin, but I could also see myself using this interchangeably with other cleansers.\n\nI also really like Garnier's Sulfate-Free Cleanser which has a pH of 5.5, fragrance-free (this smells kinda funky too at first, I suppose it's just the nature of the beast). and doesn't dry out my skin.\n\nBut I find Tabula Rasa to be especially protective of my skin while *actually cleansing*.\n\nIt's so hard to get cleanser right for dry skin bc they usually leave a film behind/doesn't clean very well. And foaming ones are usually too stripping. This hit the delicate balance in-between, at least for me. I would not be sad if I could only use this cleanser for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# COST OF KIT\n\nLower end of possible pricing if buying individually: $187 (Each item = $37.40)\n\nHigher end of possible pricing if buying individually: $230 (Each item = $46)\n\n# This kit: $75 (Each item = $15)\n\nYou can see why I couldn't pass up this opportunity to try each of their products for just $15 each. I am actually grossly obsessed with skincare (if you couldn't tell..) and I've looked high and low at skincare formulas from drugstore to sephora/ulta to dermstore/other \"medical grade\" skincare, and I have NEVER come across formulas like these.\n\nOne high end serum costing over $100 would provide maybe 1/3 of the beneficial ingredients that are in one of these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EXPECTATIONS\n\n\\- I like that this company doesn't over-sell their products, promising photoshopped-skin. They tell you to expect realistic results.\n\n\\- Idk man. I feel like I hit jackpot? Is this too good to be true? If it's true, then I think.. my skincare journey to finding the perfect regimen (gasp!) is finally.... over?\n\n\\- I **will UPDATE** when I finish these bottles. I'm guessing it would take 2-3 months. I may buy another kit to test for a longer period because 3 months is the MINIMUM you should give products to start to show results, particularly for skin-brightening serums like LEVEL.\n\nThe only other products I will be using are CosRX 96 Snail Essence & 92 Snail Cream, (I enjoy the essence more for multiple reasons before you ask. The new pump is UNF.) sunscreen, and occasionally my other cleansers to use them up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------\n\n# HOW TO USE\n\nI emailed customer service about this and this is what they told me:\n\n**MORNING**\n\n\\- Tabula Rasa cleanser\n\n\\- Vitamin X serum (Wait 1 min for it to absorb for max efficacy)\n\n\\- Spray dry face with facial spray - just water is fine - I've been using CosRX Centella toner\n\n\\- Wave Serum (optional)\n\n\\- C.R.E.A.M.\n\n\\- Sun protection\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NIGHT**\n\n\\- (I use a first cleanser here - currently [Kracie naive botanical Olive Cleansing oil](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1764/1967/products/SCMR0012_02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1532922467): works *really* well to remove everything, including waterproof mascara, but has essential oils)\n\n\\- Tabula Rasa Cleanser\n\n\\- LEVEL serum (wait 1 min)\n\n\\- Facial spray\n\n\\- Wave serum (optional)\n\n\\- C.R.E.A.M.\n\n(- I actually use my tretinoin as my last step. They said to use it before LEVEL, but idk, it's weird bc it's way thicker than LEVEL. An esthetician told me tret always shows best results if applied last.)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: For god's sake, this ISN'T AN AD. The company has NEVER contacted me. Can I not share shit anymore without being accused of being a shill? I put a lot of effort into writing my reddit posts and it's really discouraging when people do this.\n\nI don't have a freakin' blog, or insta, or youtube, or whatever, I don't write reviews anywhere else. This is the only place I share anything bc it's my outlet and because of anxiety issues. It really makes me not want to post anymore at all on reddit. Please don't send me any messages. Leave me alone.",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

I also live in Spain, where the UV index can go as high as 11 most days during this time of the year.\n\nI've tried like 30 different sunscreens in the past 3 years (I only started wearing sunscreen in 2022.. oops), and let me tell you...this is *good* stuff. With pretty much every other sunscreen, I'd come back home looking red as hell - yes, even reapplying and using generous amounts! (for example, last summer I used Vichy UV-Age daily during a heavy exposure day, as it has really high UVA protention and claims to be waterproof, and while I didn't get a sunburn, my face was giving tomato by the end of the day.. a shame, as I loved both the texture and finish). I've tried pretty much all the other popular European sunscreens like all the LRP UVMune sunscreens, which my skin just says no to every single time, especially the invisible fluid which makes me flush every single time with no exception, right after I put it on... the only one that works for me from the UVMune line is the Oil-Control gel cream but the texture isn't ideal and it doesn't prevent my skin from getting red. \n\nI bought this one last summer (the original formula before they reformulated it a few months ago) and it was life changing. I was able to go out in the middle of June and my face didn't have a hint of redness by the end of the day. I must've finished like 3 or 4 bottles last year alone. Then fall and winter came and I switched to Korean sunscreens for a while as they are more hydrating and I skip moisturiser during the day.\n\nWell, it is once again hot as hell (to the point I literally start sweating walking from room to room), so I bought the new formula, which honestly feels and looks identical, and I've been using it for the past couple weeks and once again, my skin just eats it up. I can go out when the UV index is like 6 or 7 without triggering any redness. I can also sweat in peace as it's waterproof and it doesn't come out easily (make sure you double cleanse at night).\n\n**Finish:** Natural leaning towards matte. even during Spanish summer in which most sunscreens leave me looking like a disco ball. I can re-apply 2-3 times and it still doesn't look or feel greasy.\n\n**Application:** Extremely fluid, think of like ISDIN fusion water or LRP UVMune, but not sticky at all. Super easy to spread.\n\n**Smell:** Very subtle, smells like peaches and summer. it does contain the likes of limonene and linalool, so avoid this sunscreen if you’re allergic to essential oils. The smell disappears almost immediately after and doesn’t linger all day, though.\n\n**Alcohol:** Yes, but it's only the 9th ingredient so not really drying unless you're sensitive to it\n\n**Whitecast:** Not on me as Fitzpatrick 2. Sunscreens with Tinosorb M or TriAsorB do leave me looking like a ghost and this one doesn't at all, so keep in that mind. \n\n**Eyes**: No stinging, but then again I never get any stinging from pretty much any sunscreen I've tried.\n\n**Whitecast on beard/eyebrows:** No.\n\n**Filters:** Octisalate, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, Zinc Oxide (Nano), Titanium Dioxide (Nano)\n\n**Antioxidants:** Polypodium Leucotomos Leaf Extract, Ginger Root Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol\n\n**Soothing ingredients:** Panthenol, SymCalmin, Bisabolol\n\nI wonder if the physical filters are doing the heavy lifting here and preventing my face from getting red (but they are nano, so I doubt it). Or maybe it's the antioxidants? I'm honestly super curious, as the filters are pretty standard. Either way, good stuff. I never see anyone outside of Spain talk about this sunscreen (or Heliocare in general), so thought I'd share!\n\n",

I tried all of the popular ones on here, including (but not limited to): \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBiore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ / PA++++ (caused cc)\n\nBiore Perfect Face Milk SPF50 (caused cc)\n\nElta MD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 (caused cc)\n\nShiseido Senka Mineral Water UV Gel (caused terrible cystic acne)\n\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid (caused cc)\n\nTizo Solar Protection Formula, Facial Mineral Fusion SPF 40 (my face hates silicones)\n\nBare Minerals Prep Step Mineral Shield SPF 50 (was discontinued for a while but it looks like it's back!) \n\nMurad City Skin Age Defense Broad Spectrum SPF 50 (expensive AF) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe closest I came to HG was the Bare Mineral Prep Step, but as a very fair individual, the tint was a bit too intense for my skin and I ended up looking quite orange. I found out quickly that chemical sunscreens seem to break me out. My acne is fungal and trying to find a FA safe product has been extremely challenging and frustrating.\n\n  \nIn one of my late night Amazon sessions, I somehow stumbled upon Endurance Shield High Performance Sunscreen SPF 45: [https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Sunscreen-SPF-Ounce/dp/B00B2SJL9K/ref=sr\\_1\\_3\\_a\\_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1544137555&sr=8-3&keywords=endurance+shield+sunscreen](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Sunscreen-SPF-Ounce/dp/B00B2SJL9K/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1544137555&sr=8-3&keywords=endurance+shield+sunscreen)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the ingredients: \n\nActive ingredients: Micronized zinc, 9%. Octyl methoxycinnamate, 1.5%\n\nInactive ingredients: Allantoin, aloe vera (certified organic), alpha bisabolol (chamomile), alpha lipoic acid, borage oil, cucumber extract, evening primrose oil, grape seed extract, hyaluronic acid, plantains, safflower seed, slippery elm, squalane, sunflower seed, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll admit I was a little bit skeptical about the vitamin E and octyl methoxycinnamate, but so far I haven't had any issues with it clogging my pores. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and my acne has.... improved? My freckles and dark spots are fading and I finally feel okay about all of the actives I use since my skin is protected during the day. It is non-greasy, smells amazing, slightly moisturizing, and has NO WHITE CAST! It works well as a primer under makeup. \n\nI haven't seen it mentioned on this sub before, so wanted to give it a shoutout! ",

I used to be a big fan of Cerave, but their products keep disappoint me lately, so I'm gonna pass for this",

And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

    "body": "Before I boarded the plane in Northern California, I was flipping through my Facebook when I was served an ad for a new Paula's Choice product: the [Azelaic Acid Booster](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds). Of course, as an azelaic acid devotee, my interest was piqued. I flipped through the ingredients and quickly realized I had used this product before, shipped and sold to me from the EU in the silver packaging of the [RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html#2). \n\nUp until recently, you could have this product shipped to you from the EU, but as someone pointed out to me about a month back, you can no longer have this product imported into the US. This was fairly upsetting, as the product works quite well (better than The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid suspension, in my experience) and combines AzA (10%), BHA (2%), _and_ skin-brightening licorice root - a wonderful combination for fighting acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at the same time. I've already seen some people asking about this new product, so I figured I'd so a quick review on it in case you are considering taking the plunge!\n\n* * *\n\n##Product Overview\n\n================\n\n[PHOTOS OF THE PRODUCT](https://imgur.com/a/1Hge05D)\n\nFirst off, I wanted to show the ingredient list alongside the new ingredient list for the Azelaic Acid Booster, [which is now being sold on the US Paula's Choice website](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds). \n\n\n**US - Azelaic Acid Booster Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Water (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n\n**EU - RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Aqua, Azelaic Acid (skin brightener/antioxidant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (texture-enhancing), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (hydration/skin replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (texture-enhancing), Glycerine (hydration/skin replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture-enhancing), Glyceryl Stearate (texture-enhancing), Dimethicone (hydration), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Propanediol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid, exfoliant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Sclerotium Gum (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\nThe ingredients are exactly the same, just arranged differently past a certain point. This is probably due to the FDA's packaging requirements (specifically the Fair Packaging and Label Act of 1967), which requires that all ingredients in order of concentrations up to 1% be listed in order of concentration, rather than the actual formula. Similarly, the EU regulates that ingredients must be listed in descending order by weight, up to 1%. \n\nAdmittedly, I have not purchased a tube of the Azelaic Acid Booster, so I can't tell you for certain that it has the identical feel and results, but I do feel pretty confident in assuming that it is the same product formula for both.    \n\n* * *\n\n##Ingredient Breakdown\n\n\nThere are extensive benefits to azelaic acid (AzA), but in general, AzA is an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial ingredient that is frequently used in acne and rosacea treatments, especially with sensitive skin types that are more prone to irritation from ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (BP) and tretinoin (Retin-A). In one study I cited, 20% AzA combined with glycolid acid (AHA) has been shown to be just as efficacious in treating mild-to-moderate acne as .025% tretinoin. In another study, it was shown to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin. \n\nIt is also bacteriostatic, repressing the ability of bacteria to reproduce, which may be why it is anti-inflammatory. In addition to these characteristics, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor, with a special affinity for abnormal melanocytes, making it ideal in treatment of melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). In fact, it is much safer and typically more preferred to hydroquinone, which is a skin lightener that tends to target all skin cells and has created concerns due to potentially causing tumors in mice. In an open study comparing 20% AzA twice daily to 4% hydroquinone, it showed to be just as effective if not more effective than the hydroquinone in reducing mild melasma. \n\nThis formula also contains 2% salicylic acid (BHA), a derivative of salicin. It is oil-soluable, making it more effective at penetrating to the areas most effected by acne. Like it's cousin, AHA (frequently found in the forms of glycolic or lactic acid), it helps to break apart the corneocytes that do not shed properly, which ideally prevents breakouts from occurring. It is not as photo-sensitizing as an AHA and in many people it is not nearly as irritating, even being characterized as \"soothing\" or \"anti-inflammatory\" (perhaps due to the fact that it serves as an active metabolite of asprin). Unfortunately, according to the 2016 \"[Guidelines of Care for the Management of Acne Vulgaris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897386)\" from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, \"clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of salicylic acid in acne are limited.\" \n\nThis product also contains licorice root extract, which I talked a bit about [in my review of Kikumasamune Sake Skin Lotion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8vxh46/review_review_and_ingredient_breakdown/). Licorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant – with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). “The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.” It should be noted that in the US packaging, licorice root appears after Salicylic Acid in the ingredient listing, which is 2% of the formula, so we can assume that the licorice content is less than 2%.\n\n* * *\n\n##My Experience\n\n\nI went through about half of the tube of this product before shelving it, as I felt like it aggravated the erythema in my rosacea, as most BHA products do. I've always avoided the areas around my nose, where I get the most flushed, and with this product I did have to apply the product there to deliver the benefits of AzA to my rosacean-prone areas. \n\nIt does have the exact same side effects as Finacea, tingling and itching upon first use (this eventually goes away, but is much worse if you are new to AzA), but this felt very assuring to me that it contained the amount of AzA that it is advertising (10%). \n\nIt also feels quite similar to Finacea Gel, but perhaps a bit smoother and spreads a touch easier. It also has a very Finacea-esc scent that is difficult to describe if you've never used azelaic acid products before. It is not strong by any means, nor does it linger, but I am very attuned to the scent after years of using Finacea. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have much acne these days to tell you whether or not it is ideal for acne, but I did feel like my pores looked a bit clearer and smoother while I was using it, though not markedly better than when I use 2% BHA Liquid. Nor do I have much scarring and hyperpigmentation to be able to say for sure whether this formula helped with lightening any dark spots. \n\nOther than the erythema, my skin did not have any issues with the formulation, and felt no more hydrated or irritated than when I use my regular Finacea. It did feel much more efficacious than the Ordinary's Azelaic Acid 10%, which I used briefly a couple of months back. To compare, the Ordinary's AzA is suspended in a very powdery, primer-like silicone formula, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. I also didn't feel like it really _did_ much, and I didn't feel any of the itchy tingle of the AzA on application. \n\nAll-in-all though, if you do well with BHA and are looking to add AzA to your routine, I think this is a wonderful product. \n\n\n* [To Purchase in the US](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds) \\- $36 USD + Shipping for 1 fl. oz\n\n* [To Purchase in the EU](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html) - € 36,00 ($41.97 USD) + Shipping for 1 fl. oz.\n\n* * *\n\n## Sources\n\n*   [Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient--a possible mechanism for the antibacterial action of azelaic acid in Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/)\n*   [Induction of Renal Cell Tumors in Rats and Mice, and Enhancement of Hepatocellular Tumor Development in Mice after Long‐term Hydroquinone Treatment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01783.x)\n*   [A Guide to the Ingredients and Potential Benefits of Over-the-Counter Cleansers and Moisturizers for Rosacea Patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168246/)\n*   [Dr Dray - Azelaic Acid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARIK9RdXPJ0)\n*  [Milady Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary,  2014, M.

I posted the response in the comments below.\n\n**Original post:** The whole SEEN bisabolol thing has made me nervous. I've used SEEN for years, but I do have a bad ragweed allergy, and lately my scalp has been pretty itchy. Maybe it's just a seasonal allergy thing, but I want to try something new. Anyway, this is mainly about my experience wading through reviews of fragrance-free products. Many online product reviews have been things like \"I wish it smelled nice\" or \"it would be nicer with a scent.\" There's a whole bunch of scented options out there, and we get almost nothing, especially in terms of hair care. Add other allergies into the mix, and our options get even more limited. I can't use a large chunk of hair products because of the herbal extracts or types of oils. I concede that the oils are probably beneficial, but herbal extracts don't do much for hair because hair isn't \"alive\" and active like skin.\n\nWhat's happening is these are products sent out on Vine or Influenster, and the recipients are not people who want or need fragrance-free products. I worry reviews like that are telling the market, \"see no one wants fragrance-free products,\" and unfortunately, they don't sell as well. \n\nThat's all, I figured people here would share my frustration.",

As you mentioned, some SEEN products contain bisabolol, a naturally derived skin-soothing ingredient, which is not included in SEEN as a fragrance ingredient, though it may have the potential to cross react in a minority of fragrance allergic individuals.\n\nI personally am okay with using SEEN, knowing this, but I don't blame anyone else for not being so. Currently, I'm not using SEEN. I've switched to the Ordinary for shampoo and conditioner and NYM Curl Talk FF Cream for a curl cream, which my hair has been happy with.

I haven’t been able to handle rubbing on moisturizer, so hoping a body wash can provide some relief. \n\n3) smells (flowers, citrus, cotton, etc.) overwhelm my system. I have even found some “unscented” has an alcoholic scent that I cannot tolerate. So far coconut is the only scent I’ve been able to handle. \n\n4) are there certain ones you like/dislike?\n\n5) any other suggestions?\n\nTIA!",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "**Full product name:** [Nature Republic California Aloe Fresh Powdery Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++](https://imgur.com/a/eh4pxrF) (24g of product) \n\n\nHi everyone!! I don’t think I’ve seen a review on here for this one, and no one mentioned it in the recent thread about sunscreen sticks, so I figured I should finally post something. \n\n**About Me:** combo, sensitive, acne-prone skin. Sunscreens that I truly like and have repurchased are Canmake Mermaid UV gel & Skin Aqua UV milk, although I have tried many. I like different finishes for different reasons, but generally prefer something more satin. \n\n**Price:** I bought this on yesstyle for $22 at the end of last year, and it’s currently $17 there. It’s 25,000 ₩ on the Korean Nature Republic site, which is about $20 USD, so I would just wait to find it on sale but overall it’s kind of expensive imo. \n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThere are pictures online of an older packaging, so I think this has been around for a while and then was reformulated and repackaged. Here are the current ingredients from YesStyle - \n\nButylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Polyethylene, Dimethicone, **Octocrylene**, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Silica, **Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)**, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, **Ethylhexyl Salicylate (Octyl Salicylate)**, **Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus)**, **Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb S)**, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ozokerite, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (0.2 ppm), Morinda Citrifolia Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis Flower/Leaf Extract, (-)-alpha-bisabolol, Lauryl PEG-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sea Water, Water, Butylene Glycol, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Application:** This product is alcohol free and contains a lot of silicone, which is obvious. It has a veryyyy silky slippery powdery feel, similar to a silicone makeup primer. Sometimes the thought of touching my face with sunscreen lotion hands grosses me out lol, so I like how easy and clean gliding this on my face is. Upon application, it diminishes a little bit of the shine on my face, but it’s pretty subtle and I couldn’t get a good picture of this effect. \n\n**Finish:** I would say it’s a satin finish, but will depend on your skin type. It might mattify oily skin a little, but for dry skin I suspect it would leave the tiniest sheen. Because it’s so slippery, makeup does glide on top pretty well but if you’re trying to spot conceal blemishes or something then that might be a negative point because the makeup won’t be able to stick to a specific spot. If I apply makeup it will emphasize dry skin flakes a tiny bit, even if I don’t use face powder. I didn’t notice any foundation separation issues though. \n\n**Effectiveness:** I’ve found most Korean sunscreens are not water-resistant and I don’t think this one is either. I use it for first application on days where I’m not going outside much, or for reapplication later in the day. If you’re going to sweat or swim, I would choose something else just to be safe. I haven’t noticed any freckles or sunburns, but again, I don’t really use it for strong sun exposure anyway. I also don’t think this has been independently tested after all the sunscreen drama last year (yet? If it has then please let me know!). \n\n**Smell:** As the name implies, it has an aloe and “fresh/clean” scent. It doesn’t bother me and fades pretty quickly. \n\n**TLDR:** I would give this a 3/5 rating. If you’re looking to try your first satin-finish sun stick, I think this is a decent option, especially if you can get it on sale. It’s pretty average and I like it enough to keep using, but it’s not so amazing that I’ll repurchase. \n\nI think I’ll try the isntree airy sun stick or the make p:rem one next, if anyone has a review for those!",

Looks like there's a lot in here.)\n\n**- Acetyl Zingerone**\n\n**-** [**Tocopherol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopherol)\n\n(vitamin e - works synergistically with vitamin C)\n\n**-** [**ECGC**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/epigallocatechin-gallate)\n\n(super potent antioxidant from green tea!)\n\n**-** [**Ferulic Acid**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ferulic-acid)\n\n(the gangs are all here - together with Vitamin C & E, this *kills* it in protecting your skin from sun damage and pollution.)\n\n**-** [**Resveratrol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/resveratrol)\n\n(Another super powerful antioxidant, this time from grapes. Even paula's choice, who don't believe that hard in antioxidants being 100% effective believes in this one according to an article of theirs I read.)\n\n**-** [**Genistein**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/genistein) (antioxidant from soybeans)\n\n**-** [**Quercetin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/quercetin) (antioxidant from things like broccoli, blueberries, red onions, supposed to be very soothing too)\n\n**-** [**Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hesperidin-methyl-chalcone) (never heard of it, but supposedly very anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.)\n\n**-** [**Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethylmethoxy-chromanol) (another super potent antioxidant)\n\n\\- **pH 3.0**\n\n\\- I mean,,, with this wonderful mess, do I really need another Skinceuticals vitamin c serum copycat?\n\n\\- The packaging is opaque, which protects the antioxidants inside, and the pump is super easy to use- Light orange in color, smells ultra lightly of something fresh/fruity..\n\n\\- Watery, also very light. Absorbs quickly.- I've only used this for several days now so I can't comment on efficacy yet, but so far, it gives me a nice glow after using it.\n\nCompared to Timeless vitamin C E F serum, it's more subtle. Timeless makes my skin like,, REFLECTIVE. (Timeless also helps reduce pore-enlargement and rough skin texture caused by lack of sleep if I use it at night too.)\n\nI actually prefer the glow from this rather than the Timeless tbh, because it looks more natural, glowing-from-within and not super shiny looking.\n\n\\- It would be nice to know the percentages in this as well.\n\n\\- Related: YES I DO see a difference in using an antioxidant/vitamin C serum on my dark spots/tanning especially in the summer! It makes them fade faster VS using sunscreen alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE (serum)\n\n**- 5%** [**Glycerin**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin)\n\n(the best humectant the world has to offer. Truly.)\n\n**- 5%** [**Urea**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea)\n\n(I. Have. Been. Looking. For. 5% Urea product without fragrance for **SO. LONG**. I think I went through the entire internet. But like [this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) says, urea is basically the most underrated ingredient for barrier repair. My dry ass face NEEDS this.)\n\n**- 5%** [**Hydroxyethyl Urea**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea)\n\n(Similar to just plain urea, not sure 100% the difference. I guess it's a bit less exfoliating and has more humectant properties.)\n\n\\- **1% Multimolecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid + 5% HA Crosspolymer**\n\n**- 5%** [**Betaine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/betaine)\n\n\\- **0.5% Pentacyclic Terpenes from Centella Asiatica**\n\n( *Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid* )\n\n**- NMFs like amino acids, sugars, etc.**\n\n>[***Natural moisturizing factor***](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/glossary/natural-moisturizing-factor/) ***(NMF)*** *is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%), and a few other things.Susan from Swift Crafty Monkey*\n\n\\- Has a light gel consistency, kinda cloudy clear in color. Thicker than LEVEL or VITAMIN X. Little goes a long way. Only need one pump for my whole face.\n\n\\- Holy crap, this is sooooo nice??? Idk if it's this that's doing it or the C.R.E.A.M., or both, but my disgustingly dry skin feels sufficiently moisturized!! Shocked.\n\n\\- This is my dream-come true hydrator?? It literally has everything your skin needs to draw water to it & be healthy. It kind of reminds me of Hada Labo Premium Lotion? But I personally find this even better.\n\nI'm also satisfied with the level of exfoliation the 5% urea gives, so I don't feel the need to add extra acids for my sensitive skin. I have skin that's intolerant to AHAs anyways... (But The Inkey List 3% PHA toner has been nice! It doesn't sting whatsoever.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M. (moisturizer)\n\n\\- **2% Ceramides** in a **3:1:1:1** ratio\n\n(Very important!!! Ceramides not in the right ratio can actually be harmful to your skin. The vast majority of products out there with ceramides apparently [don't have much in them](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/). I've been lusting after Skinceuticals Triple Lipid Restore cream for so long, but put off by its $128 price tag and essential oils - peppermint??? why - and other fragrant components.)\n\n\\- **2% Isosorbide Dicaprylate + 2% Glycerin + 2% Glyceryl Glucoside**\n\n**-** [**Squalane**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/squalane) **and Triglycerides**\n\n\\- **2% Ursolic Acid Liposomes**\n\n\\- **1% Bisabolol**\n\n(The soothing, healing component from chamomile.)\n\n\\- Shoot, this got errything. Ceramides, linoleic acid, squalane, and other stuff I've never heard of, but I'll trust that the formulators know what they're doing. Absolutely beautiful.\n\n\\- You can see the texture [here](https://imgur.com/a/UGWJwVS). It's a pretty thick cream. It's very, very nourishing and I love it??? I have to use it longer, and test it under different conditions, but so far I can't stop touching my face bc it feels SO soft. Oily skinned people may find this too moisturizing? Not sure.\n\n\\- I absolutely SLATHER my face is HUGE dollops of Aveeno Eczema Healing Cream (with Eucerin 5% Urea cream underneath) and top that with a good amount of the balm version of that in order to not wake up to dry, tight face. I've been testing this by itself, but two pumps instead of one like in the morning, and surprisingly my skin doesn't feel tight!!\n\nI was worried this wouldn't be enough, but it is! I'm gonna test it with the Aveeno balm to see if I get even better results. - Um, too early I know, but I feel like I found my HG moisturizer..?\n\n\\- I want this in giant buckets. Thnx.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# TABULA RASA (cleanser)\n\n\\- **Stabilized Surfactant structures** formulated to be **barrier-safe**\n\n\\- **Amino Acid-based surfactants**\n\n\\- **10% Glycerin**\n\n\\- **5% Betaine**\n\n\\- **pH 5.3-5.5**\n\n\\- Woow that's a lot of glycerin. You only need a small dollop and it lathers into a thick, rich foam. Not big, fluffy bubbles but small, rich bubbles. Very nice.\n\n\\- Smells strange.. I can't really place it.. maybe like,, sour glue? It's not so strong that it bothers me a whole lot. It's a fantastic cleanser for my dry skin and I'm just glad that it's fragrance-free.\n\n\\- After washing, my face doesn't feel tight. At all. In fact, it feels *moist.* M O I S T\n\nIt washes off cleanly though, I don't feel like there's a film left behind. This has not dried out my skin after several days of using it in a row 2x a day, like some cleansers do even if they don't dry me out initially.\n\n\\- I would like this in a bigger bottle, preferably in a pump! I don't like squeezy tubes bc water ALWAYS gets in the cap in the shower.\n\n\\- I am impressed, and this is the best cleanser I have tried for my dry skin, but I could also see myself using this interchangeably with other cleansers.\n\nI also really like Garnier's Sulfate-Free Cleanser which has a pH of 5.5, fragrance-free (this smells kinda funky too at first, I suppose it's just the nature of the beast). and doesn't dry out my skin.\n\nBut I find Tabula Rasa to be especially protective of my skin while *actually cleansing*.\n\nIt's so hard to get cleanser right for dry skin bc they usually leave a film behind/doesn't clean very well. And foaming ones are usually too stripping. This hit the delicate balance in-between, at least for me. I would not be sad if I could only use this cleanser for the rest of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# COST OF KIT\n\nLower end of possible pricing if buying individually: $187 (Each item = $37.40)\n\nHigher end of possible pricing if buying individually: $230 (Each item = $46)\n\n# This kit: $75 (Each item = $15)\n\nYou can see why I couldn't pass up this opportunity to try each of their products for just $15 each. I am actually grossly obsessed with skincare (if you couldn't tell..) and I've looked high and low at skincare formulas from drugstore to sephora/ulta to dermstore/other \"medical grade\" skincare, and I have NEVER come across formulas like these.\n\nOne high end serum costing over $100 would provide maybe 1/3 of the beneficial ingredients that are in one of these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EXPECTATIONS\n\n\\- I like that this company doesn't over-sell their products, promising photoshopped-skin. They tell you to expect realistic results.\n\n\\- Idk man. I feel like I hit jackpot? Is this too good to be true? If it's true, then I think.. my skincare journey to finding the perfect regimen (gasp!) is finally.... over?\n\n\\- I **will UPDATE** when I finish these bottles. I'm guessing it would take 2-3 months. I may buy another kit to test for a longer period because 3 months is the MINIMUM you should give products to start to show results, particularly for skin-brightening serums like LEVEL.\n\nThe only other products I will be using are CosRX 96 Snail Essence & 92 Snail Cream, (I enjoy the essence more for multiple reasons before you ask. The new pump is UNF.) sunscreen, and occasionally my other cleansers to use them up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------\n\n# HOW TO USE\n\nI emailed customer service about this and this is what they told me:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MORNING**\n\n\\- Tabula Rasa cleanser\n\n\\- Vitamin X serum (Wait 1 min for it to absorb for max efficacy)\n\n\\- Spray dry face with facial spray - just water is fine - I've been using CosRX Centella toner\n\n\\- Wave Serum (optional)\n\n\\- C.R.E.A.M.\n\n\\- Sun protection\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NIGHT**\n\n\\- (I use a first cleanser here - currently [Kracie naive botanical Olive Cleansing oil](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1764/1967/products/SCMR0012_02_1024x1024.jpg?v=1532922467): works *really* well to remove everything, including waterproof mascara, but has essential oils)\n\n\\- Tabula Rasa Cleanse\n\nr- LEVEL serum (wait 1 min)- Facial spray\n\n\\- Wave serum (optional)\n\n\\- C.R.E.A.M.\n\n(- I actually use my tretinoin as my last step. They said to use it before LEVEL, but idk, it's weird bc it's way thicker than LEVEL. An esthetician told me tret always shows best results if applied last.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: For god's sake, this ISN'T AN AD. The company has NEVER contacted me. Can I not share shit anymore without being accused of being a shill? I put a lot of effort into writing my reddit posts and it's really discouraging when people do this.\n\nI don't have a freakin' blog, or insta, or youtube, or whatever, I don't write reviews anywhere else. This is the only place I share anything bc it's my outlet and because of anxiety issues. It really makes me not want to post anymore at all on reddit. Please don't send me any messages.

    "body": "Hello all! I wanted to write an early review of the Paula's Choice 10% AzA, because hot DAMN. \n\nJust to clarify again, I've only been using it for a week, so it's too early to say anything definitive about the product. This is just my first impression. \n\nIngredients (copy and pasted from their website:) \nWater (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\nIt has a cream consistency. I've read that AzA does better in a gel consistency, so if you don't have good results with this, that may be something to consider. \n\nSo a little background: I have mild rosacea, and I've been using Differin to keep my skin clear. I don't have super acne-prone skin, but I do get breakouts. I typically need something (salicylic acid or differin) to keep them at bay. Differin dried my skin out, and made my rosacea worse, but it cleared my skin. So I was on the hunt for something more soothing. The rest of my routine is pretty much set in solid stone, so it's a good base to test new acids from. \n\nI received my package from PC last Thursday, and for once in my life I spot-tested the cream. I put it right on my cheek, where I tend to get reddest if I'm sensitive to a product. After six hours there were no signs of irritation, so I applied a pea-sized amount to my entire face at night. I used it after my serum and before my moisturizer. \n\nAfter two days, I increased to twice a day application, now in place of my serum. I'm hooked. My skin is behaving like normal skin again - it produces oil, even! I look dewy! I can wear makeup! Because my skin isn't irritated 24/7, it looks more luminous, and much less red. Old marks are beginning to heal (which was a huge issue with differin - my skin never healed.) \n\nI'm having a slight purge - areas that were congested had a couple whiteheads, and it takes longer for active acne to go away with AzA than it did with Differin. I'm touching my face a lot right now because it's so soft, so that could also be a factor! But the immediate change in my skin's appearance and behavior have made me so pleased. Even if it didn't make my skin clearer, just the difference in how my skin feels is so good. \n\nIt's 36$ an ounce, but you get a discount if you sign up for autodelivery. They suggest every three months, but I'm thinking it's going to be every two for a twice a day application. Fine by me - now that my skin's not super dry I can skip my expensive serum. \n\nI definitely recommend testing it out if you're in the market for an azelaic acid, or if other acids are too harsh!",

It has a light smell due to the bisabolol, but not unpleasant in my opinion. If you already liked the squalane, you will definitely like this product. I like that they mention thr pure HPR concentration on the bottle now (0.5%). It would be completely perfect if it was in an airless pump. Grant Industries recommends: \"It is recommended to formulate this product in a manner that avoids infusing air/oxygen into the final cosmetic product. Like all\nretinoids, the highly specific set of conjugated double bonds are susceptible to oxidation; anti-oxidants\nlike Vitamin- E and BHT/BHA are suggested\" ([link](http://dir.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/file/4604/CT_GranactiveRetinoid.pdf)).\n\n* EUK 134 0.1%\nThin oil texture with a brown color, no smell. It is very oily on the back of my hand and doesn't really absorb, but keeps laying on top of skin like very small sweat drops. On my face however it doesn't look shiny. It feels warm when applying it, and slightly burning during the day. The product is basically pure Propanediol, which can be irritating to skin. The CIR study found that concentrations >75% are mildly irritating to human skin. When layering other products you definitely feel a kind of oily layer. You can't combine this with anything acidic, so vitamin c, alpha lipoic acid, ferulic acid, AHA, BHA, azelaic acid etc. This can make it difficult to fit into your routine.\n\n* Resveratrol+Ferulic Acid\nVery similar to EUK although this doesn't have the brown color. Again almost pure Propanediol, which can be irritating to skin (that's also causing the warm feeling on skin).\n\nThese were just the first days and I will keep using the products for a while, in theory the active ingredients are really good, but so far the texture of the EUK and Resveratrol is a little bit thicker and more oily feeling when layering other products than I had hoped. During the day they feel slightly burning, I don't know if that's due to the Propanediol or the actives.\n\n",

With the lipoic acid (which wow) the texture and smell is not a plus but considering the result the next morning, so worth it.",

Are you applying both to your entire face, like one step each? With those concentrations, you can probably mix a couple drops in with another product, which should help with absorption and irritation.",

    "body": "I am sure many are familiar with the recent discussion of ceramide formulations being effective/ineffective so when I came across the Atopalm website that makes it very accessible to US residents , I bought several Zeroid products to see whether it's just hype or whether they really work.  I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy. \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night.  Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.  \n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.  \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.  \n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning. \n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)\n\nI have also tried La Mer, Nivea Mexico and Nivea Germany and will do a write up comparison on SCA when I can cough up the energy.",

I was curious as to how one could assemble enough chemicals to \"sufficiently\" recreate a sizable number of essential oils. The point being, of course, not to **permanently** replace those naturals, but rather serve as a suitable temporary option to give you a decent idea of what the real thing might smell like.  \n\n\nOf course, one could debate endlessly what exactly constitutes \"sufficient\", which is a debate I will stay far, far away from. Instead, what I present below is a list of chemicals, which last time I checked, were available for purchase at one of the major reputable U.S.-based suppliers.

I personally have had way more success using Louis Apell formulas than gcms as starting points. But ymmv.",

    "body": "This strain has been on my radar for some time as I’ve heard only very positive feedback about this gem. \n\n\nI hesitated because I thought it may taper into sedation for me too much for day time use, compared to cult energising day strains such as Superseed Rhapsody Haze which turns me into a superwoman 🧚🏼‍♀️ and despite that being that I love fruit and candy terps I would love this 🍭 🍊 \n\nWell I finally got a script and wow, this is one of the most top shelf cannabis I’ve had in McOz 🏆 \n\nIt’s not surprising when my number one fave strain ever was Broken Coast Sunset Sherbert - sadly only two batches were released and I hope one day it comes back 🤲 \n\nIn the meantime I’m as enamoured with this strain as the OG Sunset Sherbert!\n\nBroken Coast Emergenz is orange push pop x sunset sherbert, absolutely wild genetics 🧬 \n\nIt is a sativa dominant hybrid at 26% thc and an impressive 3.86% terps. The higher the thc, the lower the terps, and for me personally I prioritise high terps 🤩\n\nThe top terps are beta caryophyllene, limonene, alpha bisabolol, linalool and myrcene. Those terps combine to make the most complex and layered orange flavours. There is the slightest floral hint, with citrus and grapefruit and rind, and a very minor background of pine 🌲 \n\nIt is very sweet and absolutely beautiful - it’s a tub I cannot stop opening because I’m in love with the divine aroma 🥳\nIt is like a day version of Delta Tetra Orange Cake which I also absolutely love 🍊 🍰 \nBeing absolutely not a fan of old dry and muted OZ MC, this is an absolute delight. \n\nIt’s grown in BC, cured to perfection. Grinds up very fluffy and passes the sticky icky test with flying colours, giving the full kinetic sand dance 💃 it doesn’t get fresher and better cured than this 🫶🏽\n\nI got all medium to large nugs with one 3.62g nug!\n\nThe taste translates beautifully in my TM2 and I also tried it in my Omura with a flower stick and I got lots of lovely billowy vape clouds ⭐️\n\nThe nuggets are a fairly bright green with orange pistils, it’s lovely and frosty 😃\n\nWhere it shines of course is the effects, wow! Treating depression- I’m looking mostly for a strong mood uplift, this delivers in spades. It is one of the most uplifting strains I’ve ever had, apart from Broken Coast Sunset Sherbert and special shout out to Sativite Walken and Single Estate Pebble Punch 🙌🏽\n\n\nThe effects are really long lasting. It does tick the box for me for a day strain, but I would rotate it with other uplifting and energising day strains eg terpinolene dom strains to have options depending on set and setting, as this has a creative and cruisy feeling to it. It makes the world feel like a better place ☮️ 🕊️ \n\nI can’t believe I waited to try this, and I find the incredible combination of smell, taste, terps, freshness and effects makes this one of my favorite strains EVER in OZ MC and it will be staying firmly in my rotation 🧡🧡🧡\n\nBroken Coast have some great strains - really lovingly grown craft cannabis. \nNext appointment I’ll definitely get a script for their platinum pave too!🥰\n\nHappy holidays MCOZ tribe 🌱💚\n",

    "body": "I had been wanting to try the old NR FTE for a long time, but it was discontinued earlier this year. Since I really liked the white vita capsule essence, I decided to take a chance on the white vita first essence after my Missha FTE intensive ran out. Since I haven't seen reviews for this product, I figured it would be good to post one myself.\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is extremely dehydrated. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. My main concerns are keeping my skin hydrated, fading PIH, decreasing redness, and acne prevention. For reference, here is my full routine:  \n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)  \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)  \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nNR white vita first essence  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence  \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nDr. Jart ceramidin cream    \n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces ferment (edited to add: 87.8%), methylpropanediol, propanediol, niacinamide (2%), betaine, phellinus linteus extract, articum lappa root extract, dioscorea japonica root extract, pancratium maritimum extract, nymphaea alba flower extract, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, argania spinosa kernel oil, hydrogenated lecithin, 1,2-hexanediol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, water, glycerin, sodium citrate, bifida ferment lysate, ethylhexylglycerin, citric acid, polyquaternium-51, glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, raffinose, biosaccharide gum-1, butylene glycol, lecithin, dipropylene glycol, sodium palmitoyl proline, bisabolol, acetic acid, lactic acid, dicaprylyl carbonate, ascorbyl glucoside, zinc pca, sucrose distearate, ceramide np, retinyl palmitate, bioflavonoids, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, hesperidin, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate  \n\nTexture: The first essence is a runny liquid, but has a slight viscosity to it when compared to water. It isn't as runny as the Missha FTE. It sinks in well and provides light hydration, definitely more hydrating than the Missha. The first essence has the same light fragrance as the white vita capsule essence.  \n\nEffect: Glow! The NR first essence has given my skin much more glow than the Missha FTE did. In addition to the glow, the NR has helped with reducing PIH (the Missha had no effect on PIH). My white vita capsule essence was already doing a good job of lightening PIH, and using the first essence along with it has boosted the speed at which the PIH fades. I'm really glad I took a chance and tried the white vita first essence.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

Also, except the fact that they used too many extracts/fragrances,  they use pretty safe stuffs like pentylene glycol and methypropanediol for solvents. Betaine is a nice moisturizer, and sodium hyaluronate and Argan are also added. Even though negligible amount, Retinyl Palmitate & Vitamin C is there as well. This is a serum with excellent ingredients. Amazing!!\nAgain, Thanks for sharing!! I would definitely go online, and order it. \n\nLove, \n\nRandy",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

I don't necessarily believe in spending less or more based on the type of product. If it's something that absolutely fits all your bills and you know it won't make you want go buy anything else since it matches you to perfection it's better on getting that one than mindlessly trying to try multiple other products which anyways you wil be spending on. But if it's out of budge liek way off then keep your search on😅 for me it's cleansers. Ppl spend thr least on it but for me the perfect cleanser was something I badly needed. Found one expensive yes but saves me from buying or being tempted to buy anything else. Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

    "body": "**The Good**\n\nAlthough Q4 results weren't officially pre-released, there were a number of hints on the call that allow us to reach some conclusions.\n\nJohn Melo Quotes\n\n>1.preliminary numbers indicate once again we've just about doubled our consumer revenue year-on-year  \n>  \n>2.consumer is not slowing down actually our quarter on quarter growth for the fourth quarter was the highest quarter on quarter growth we've delivered in six quarters  \n>  \n>3.I can tell you a few things about the quarter our core business grew 40 a little more than 40% quarter on quarter that's the highest quarter over quarter growth that we've seen in over six quarters  \n>  \n>4.the total business year on year when we look at the fourth quarter is up 55%  \n>  \n>5. category leaders the brands in the category leadership bucket today based on market input market feedback market inquiries is worth about $1.9 billion on a on an asset basis that's the value of that of that portfolio today that portfolio today coming out of the fourth quarter has an annualized revenue of about 230 million it is an amazing portfolio of consumer brands \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuote #1 implies:  **64.4M Consumer** is a \"double\" from the 32.2M in 4Q2021\n\nQuote #2 implies: **64.7M+ Consumer** revenue is QoQ growth of 39% (which matches the highest QoQ growth rate (38.8%) in the last 6 Q's)\n\nQuote #3 implies: **99.5M+ Core revenue** is QoQ growth of 40% from 71.1M in Q3.\n\nQuote #4 Implies: 291.5M+ FY2022 total revenue (55% over 188M FY2021), which implies **Q4 Core revenue of \\~98M**\n\nQuote #5 Implies: **58M Q4 Revenue (230M/4Qs)** for the \"Billion Dollar Club\" brands (Biossance, JVN, 4UbyTia, Stripes, Menolabs, Rose, Pipette). Now add all the \"Not So Billion Dollar Club\" brands of Purecane, Costa, Eco, Onda Beauty, and you start getting near that 65M consumer rev. mark.\n\nWhen you consider these numbers against the backdrop of being extremely cash constrained in the quarter and having had the lowest cash burn (e.g., marketing spend) of the year I consider this a big win.\n\nWhen you also consider cash burn vs revenue growth each Q in 2022, it's a further indication of the strength of the Q4 numbers (even if they may fall just short of guidance).\n\nQ1: 195M burn delivered 121% YOY Growth\n\nQ2: 186M burn delivered 108% YOY Growth\n\nQ3: 162M burn delivered  98% YOY Growth\n\n**Q4: 125M(max?) burn will deliver \\~100% YOY Growth**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Good :\n\nStrategic Transaction #2 and #3\n\nJohn Melo\n\n>we are in the process of establishing an exclusive molecule marketing partnership for another category we're in and we have another one we have two new ones that are going to market this year one in health and one in a space that we're well respected for\n\nST#2 will almost certainly be Squalene (\"one in health\"), and ST#3 will be for a molecule we're likely already producing otherwise I don't think he'd use the expression \"we're well respected for\" (Bisabolol maybe? He did praise it on the call as a key ingredient JVN).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Bad**\n\nBarra Bonita \"Lines\"\n\nFor over a year, the company's been telling us we're capacity constrained.  They sell every last drop of molecules they can make.  For 9 months they've been telling us all 5 lines (3 large, 2 small) would be operational by the end of the year. Today:\n\nJohn Melo\n\n>..other two lines are completely built and ready to go but they're very small lines they are 40,000 liter tanks and because they're small lines we actually did not have molecules that make sense to making those lines during the fourth quarter so we didn't operate in those lines  \n>  \n>I just wanna make sure that's clear the lines are set built ready to go. Did we operate in the fourth quarter? No, why, we didn't need to we actually need to focus on one thing keep the three blinds six big tanks working all out\n\nSay what?!  Either we're capacity constrained or we have excess capacity we don't need.  Which is it?  And why tell us all year (and very recently) they were going to be operational by year-end if there was no immediate need for them?\n\nIMO, this is likely a cash conservation action since we're obviously operating on cash fumes. It takes $$ and manpower ($$) to bring more capacity online and likely the reason why, for now, they've had a change of heart wrt the 2 small lines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJob Cuts\n\nJob Cuts savings of 10M is a start, but it's not deep enough. When you consider that every quarter this year, the biggest contribution to the SGA increase YOY was \"head count expense\" you realize why 10M in cuts isn't deep enough.\n\nQ1 - 22M of the YOY increase in SGA was headcount expense\n\nQ2 - 20-25M of the YOY increase in SGA was headcount expense\n\nQ3 - 13 M of the YOY increase in SGA was headcount expense\n\nIt's clear our headcount expense/hiring got out of wack.  The job cuts announced today are a good start, but I think there is more room here to align our headcount expense growth with our revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ugly**\n\nStrategic Transaction #1\n\nWorse than still not knowing whether the deal is under HSR review, or submitted for review, or whether they're still at the negotiating table, we get a terrible hint of the value of the deal possibly not being $500M (350/150).\n\nI find it ironic that for 9 months the ST is all Melo wanted to talk about, yet now after everyone has pegged the 2 molecules, the licensee, and the Apprinova buyout, he now doesn't want to put the transaction at risk by talking about it. EL OH EL!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJohn Melo\n\n>I think we put out a PR end of the year I think right last week of the year and in that PR we talked about where we were with the transaction which is we landed all the economic terms we had some conditions to work through including HSR all of that we're in process of working through and I think we indicated we'd have the transaction closed in early Q1 and that's where we are I think there's no new news to share we're excited we really like the partner on the other end but one of my lessons is when you're live in closing a transaction you don't go and talk a lot about the transaction and I think that just introduces more risk for us and the partner and we're not prepared to do that so I appreciate the question  \n>  \n>I would say the near term cash component versus the total value of **the deal has remained fairly intact** even though there's been a lot of negotiation back and forth right so but I don't have anything new to share at this point\n\n&#x200B;\n\nST#1 Silver lining:\n\nThough I'm now preparing myself for something less than 350M and 150M for ST#1, Melo still contends that the proceeds of  ST#1 (plus the cash we're ending Q4 with) funds all of our capital needs through 2023.... so if there is a reduction in the value of ST#1, it's unlikely to be significant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>with the combination of both what we finished and our strategic transaction funds all of our needs through 2023 based on where we are today so we're excited about that we've got a clear path cash use is coming down and our business is performing super well so what are we focused on delivering a path to profitability\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO NOT GET LOST WITH THE MAGIC DUST YA'LL.",

That's a first.\n\nIt really isn't that hard, mgmt makes it harder than it needs to be. Cut everything non-essential. Show that the business can actually make money (i.e. a positive gross margin on consumer & ingredients) and prove the business can actually make money.\n\nThe growth story isn't in tact when the cost to grow pushes us further away from profitability. Once you have proven the business model ACTUALLY works, the SP will reflect that. At that point, you can tap into equity to add some fuel. But that must be done responsibly.\n\nIf they can't prove that Barra Bonita can get them to a point where product gross margin is positive, they are going under. It is that simple. I don't think that will be reflected in the F/S until after Q3 ER though. If that ER doesn't show a 20% or better gross margin I will be selling all of my shares.",

Isso sem qualquer tratamento.\n\nMinha pele sempre foi bem ruim, desde a puberdade. Embora as espinhas não sejam tão comuns, era cheia de resto de pele, filamentos sebáceos, poros extremamente dilatados e tudo de ruim, a ponto das pessoas comentarem e eu ter baixíssima autoestima devido a isso. Na época, uma ex-namorada me ajudou com algumas dicas básicas, o que fez minha pele melhorar MUITO em relação ao que era. Desde então uso sabonete facial Actine para pele oleosa, ao menos uma vez ao dia, geralmente a noite, com auxílio da InFace (gostei do resultado, que é bem aproximado ao que eu tinha com a Foreo Luna 2 que ela tinha), o que melhorou muito a aparência e toque mais uniforme. Também ajudou no controle da oleosidade. Porém, quero recomendações para uma melhor rotina, visto que há muito o que se melhorar ainda.\n\nA princípio, são estes os produtos que tenho. Atualmente minha rotina é a seguinte:\n\n- Sabonete facial Actine para pele oleosas e acneicas;\n- Sabonete facial Labotrat com vitamina C;\n- Azelan (ácido azelaico);\n- Hidratante facial refrescante em gel Vult;\n- Protetor solar Neostrata Minesol oil control FPS 70.\n\nManhã: Ao acordar, lavo o rosto com sabonete Labotrat, em seguida o hidratante Vult e, por último, o protetor solar, que renovo na hora do almoço após lavar o rosto apenas com água corrente, visto que a oleosidade já está bem aparente.\n\nNoite: após o banho (tenho usado sabonete glicerinado Suavitrat, pois não é só a pele do rosto que é bem oleosa), lavo o rosto com o sabonete Actine, com auxílio da InFace, após secar, passo o Azelan (tenho inclusive algumas manchas antigas de acne que pretendo uniformizar) e depois de 10 minutos, novamente o hidratante Vult.\n\nGostaria de recomendações. Tenho pensado em comprar o Creamy azul (10% ácido glicólico + niacinamida + alfa-bisabolol) e o roxo (retinol 0,3), além de, se necessário, o sérum Principia 10% niacinamida + 1% zinco e sérum Neutrogena hydro boost, este último em substituição ao hidratante Vult somente a noite. Quanto ao Principia, não sei se há necessidade e se o resultado é realmente efetivo, visto que a concentração de niacinamida é bem alta, bem além do que aparentemente é comprovado como mais alta eficiência, o que me deixou desconfiado quanto a questão de mero marketing. Também penso em substituir o protetor solar pelo Libbs Filtrum ultra seco, que já usei e pareceu ser melhor pro efeito seco ou testar o Missha Soft Finish Sun Milk, que ouvi maravilhas.\n\nEnfim, depois desse textão, agradeço a quem chegou até aqui e fico aberto sobre recomendações, dicas e sugestões e críticas para que eu possa melhorar minha rotina skincare e, consequentemente, a qualidade da minha pele do rosto extremamente oleosa!\n\nMuuuuuito obrigado!",

Esses comerciais como creamy e principias são legais mas os principais ativos geralmente tem uma concentração bem menor do que os que são “remédio” como adacne. Recentemente estava com a pele n muito legal e aumentei a dose de adapaleno, e MEU DEUS a diferença é notória. Entao, vale a pena considerar.\n\nSobre testar: será se esse actine n é muito forte e causa efeito rebote? será se um outro hidratante n seria menos propenso a deixar a pele oleosa? difícil dizer. (eu sei que passou do ponto quando minha pele fica “esticando” tipo uma sensação da pele ta puxando ou quando fica coçando).\n\nPequenas mudanças que pode testar: azelan 2x no dia, sabonete mais suave, usar esfoliação fisica 1x na semana apenas, usar mascara facial 1x por semana, tirar algum alimento que vc sente que pode afetar como chocolate ou queijo. Tem várias opções que n envolvem dinheiro pra ir testando e ajustando.",

    "body": "I did a [first impressions](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fc7lcw/regimen_lab_skincare_first_impressions_ingredient/) on the Regimen skincare kit I got almost 3 months ago. \n\nI got a little overexcited (blame my ADHD) but after using them for like 2 months and 3 weeks or so, I have a better idea about how they worked out for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My skin type:* Dehydrated, **SUPER dry** skin. I mean, **REALLY dry.** Already had dry skin but with tret every other day, it's crazy, crazy dry. I can't do regular tret either, gotta be microsphere. \n\n*Climate:* Dry, desert Cali. Not too cool but not disgustingly hot as of yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let me eat my words. I figured out that my skin does best with many different hydrating AND nourishing/fatty layers. Trying to simplify my routine made my skin drier and drier and I found myself missing my old products. Anyways.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\n# LEVEL Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Betaine, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tranexamic acid, NAG, Alpha Arbutin, Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Hexanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate, Tetrahydrodiferuloylmethane, Hexylresorcinol, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Salix Alba Bark Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Light, liquidy, slightly gel-like. Has a \"glycol\" feel rather than completely water-like. I think people who have never felt the raw glycols before describe it as something slightly \"oily\". Dimethyl isosorbide also feels similar to glycols, but much lighter and not sticky like them. Absorbs quickly. Non-sticky. Layers well with others. \n\n**COLOR:** Pale yellow-tinted transparent gel.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture/pore refinement. Noticeable, but not hugely so. \n\nI am ***extremely*** prone to dark spots. I only get breakouts on my chin. The PIE/PIH that gets left over from acne are only on my chin. The other spots are from sun damage. Aaaand, as you can see from the before and after pictures, my dark spots have actually gotten slightly worse, and more numerous. It's easier to tell irl than in pictures. \n\n[Before/After pics](https://imgur.com/a/SAWwCqK)\n\nI feel like I haven't given it enough time to see real results since I used it for less than 3 months. 3 months is the standard time you should give skin-brightening products time to work. But from the results I can glean from this limited time, I am not super impressed. \n\nHowever, I'm willing to give it another try if it comes out for $35 instead of $45, because I *mostly blame the switch to a new sunscreen* on my spots darkening/getting more dark spots. \n\nI know many people love the Purito centella sunscreen, but it just is not protective enough for my skin type. I am super diligent about sun protection, and the 99% of the sun I get is from commuting in the car once or twice a week (\\~20 min) and sitting in front of windows for meals. I have blackout curtains in my room and only exercise during the night. \n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm honestly kind of upset that the progress on my dark spots that I worked so hard on for years have been reversed a little. \n\nAnyways, the ingredient list is absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a much better deal than Skinceuticals' 3% tranexamic + 5% niacinamide serum. So perhaps if I use a better sunscreen and give it longer, LEVEL may work better for me. \n\n**PRICE:** *$35-45 /30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# VITAMIN X Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Propanediol, Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Acetyl Zingerone, Glycerin, Hexanediol, Tocopherol, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Ferulic Acid, Resveratrol, Genistein, Glutathione, Quercetin, Silymarin, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Also has a \"glycol feel\". Lightweight, absorbs quickly. Feels like I should use it after watery toners, but since it's vitamin C, I used it before anything else. \n\n**COLOR:** Orange tinted transparent gel. It did not change color the entire time I have had it, but I can't be sure of course, because of the original color. I imagine I will only be able to tell once it oxidizes heavily and turns brownish. \n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** Light texture refinement. Like the LEVEL serum, I started out only using it once a day. Then I switched to using it twice a day after about almost a month in or so. \n\nGave my skin a subtle, soft glow. \n\nCompared to the Timeless Vitamin C serum, I just didn't see nearly as much texture/pore refinement and glow factor. I have the type of skin that sees zero results from ascorbic acid derivatives (SAP, MAP, etc).\n\nA bit disappointing on the visual results department, but perhaps other people may like it for all the other antioxidants loaded in this serum that may be protecting the skin without visual refinement. \n\nI was still happily using it up, BUT, I had to stop several days ago. I noticed that it was suddenly filled with tons of little grains??? \n\nI'm not sure if you can [**see it in the pictures**](https://imgur.com/a/PkTvttF), but it almost seems like the vitamin C in the serum spontaneously changed back to powder form.\n\nWhat the hell happened? Stability issue? I am not sure. \n\nAmbitious little serum, but it didn't work out for me in practice.\n\nI'm testing out Maelove Glow Maker at the moment, and so far Timeless is winning out but since it's only been a very short time, we'll see. Am planning to try a Skinceuticals sample next. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$50-60 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# WAVE Serum\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Betaine, Glycerin, Urea, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Sorbitol, Lactic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pectin, Proline, Serine, Arginine, Glucose, Fructose, Maltose, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** A thin gel. Thicker and heavier-feeling than LEVEL & VITAMIN X. Absorbs a little slower. Still lightweight.  \n\n**COLOR:** A slightly cloudy, transparent.\n\n**SCENT:** None.\n\n**RESULTS:** It has a ton of beneficial ingredients, and was pretty hydrating. But for some reason, I found myself reaching for this less than my other, more watery hydrating essences/toners. \n\nIt may just be my personal preference, but I've been more into thinner, watery layers more than thicker ones as of late. \n\nFelt similar to Hada Labo Premium lotion but a little less hydrating? I still quite enjoyed using it. \n\nThis would be plenty of hydration for most people probably, but I have exceptionally dry skin, and this by itself was not enough to really plump out my skin. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$40-50 / 30ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Maybe, if it was cheaper. Urea in serum form is a really rare find. But I can probably get a similar effect with a couple of different serums and a urea moisturizer combined for cheaper. If my skin wasn't so darn dehydrated and dry, this would be a fantastic all-in-one sort of convenient step for me since it really has every humectant your skin can use/has naturally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TABULA RASA Cleanser\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Betaine, Propanediol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate (and) Aqua (and) PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Phenylpropanol, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic acid, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin.* \n\n**TEXTURE:** A fluid gel. It doesn't foam up a whoooole lot, but the ideal amount foams up to a thick, luxurious feeling foam if you keep rubbing. It has more \"slip\" than Sunday Riley's Ceramic Slip cleanser if you've used that before. (If you use too little, it fails to foam.)\n\nIt feels really similar to my drugstore HG cleanser, Garnier SkinActive Gentle Sulfate-Free Cleanser initially. But that one doesn't create nice, thick feeling foam. That one cleans well but foams out to very small, non-substantial foam. \n\n**COLOR:** A opaque, white gel. \n\n**SCENT:** A strong, glue-like smell? No masking fragrance. \n\n**RESULTS:** I'm not always a gel-cleanser type of gal, but I actually really enjoy using this cleanser. It really *does* feel MOIST after washing, like my initial assessment. I personally have not used a cleanser with that sort of after-feel before. As a dry-skinned person, I *really* like that!\n\nIt didn't end up drying me out. I found it a really nice, hydrating second cleanser. The only issue was the strong smell, but I have a sensitive nose. I prefer it to smell a little weird than it be loaded with fragrance, personally. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$17-20 /100ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** Yes, I really like this cleanser and would not mind having it on my sink if it came in pretty packaging! I can find other cleansers that can do the job just fine, but if it was pretty and maybe came in a bigger size, I can definitely see myself repurchasing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# C.R.E.A.M.\n\n*Ingredients: Water, Squalane, Capric/Caprylic Triglycerides, Propanediol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Glucoside, Isosorbide Dicaprylate, Phospholipids, Ursolic Acid, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Bisabolol, Isoamyl Laurate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Tocopherol, Dimethoxymethyl Chromanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\n**TEXTURE:** Picture of texture [here](https://imgur.com/EhE4aHM). A *very* thick, nourishing cream. A little hard to spread. Layered well with other things, cosmetically elegant.\n\n**COLOR:** White, opaque. \n\n**SCENT:** None. \n\n**RESULTS:** I have this MIGHTY NEED to try out as many ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/barrier repair creams as I can get my hands on. So I was REALLY excited to try this cream out. \n\nThis cream was really moisturizing and felt protective on the skin. However, I had to use quite a lot to moisturize my skin. So I ran out of it pretty fast. \n\nIt felt really good, but it failed to keep my skin completely flake-free under sunscreen & makeup and throughout the night by itself. \n\nBut **please** keep in mind that I have *incredibly* dry skin; My skin is an asshole and it's not enough to merely slug life with Vaseline/Aquaphor/CeraVe Healing ointment. It needs lots of humectants and lots of FATS & occlusives to keep it from feeling tight. (I have eczema-prone body skin as well and go through moisturizers by the bucketloads..)\n\nNone of these creams *by themselves* can prevent me from waking up to skin tighter-feeling than I'd like despite *slathering* them on: CeraVe cream & First Aid Beauty UR creams - *way* too light & matte, Atopalm MLE, Zeroid Intensive, Zeroid Oint-Cream (almost!), Real Barrier Extreme, Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Cream, La Roche Posay Lipikar AP+ Baume, Udderly Smooth, etc. \n\nI have to layer multiple of these on in order to wake up to moisturized skin. The only ones applied by themselves that give me the same results as layering multiple on are Aveeno eczema therapy cream & Ceradan barrier repair cream so far.\n\n(I have a big review post coming up sometime in the future on all these but it's gonna take a while.\\^)\n\nI've seen other reviews saying how much this C.R.E.A.M. has helped their dry skin, so I think it should work well for most folks. \n\n**PRICE:**  *$45-55 / 50ml* \n\n**REPURCHASE?:** No, unless somehow they come out with an actual bucket-sized option for cheap lmao. \n\n\\---------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! I had a lot of fun trying this kit. The company's customer service was incredibly helpful and nice. I hope they can tweak and improve on some things and their actual release goes well!",

Haha. I tried a bunch of the zeroid products (oint cream, soothing cream, and 5% urea cream) and the oint-cream is my favorite for night time, urea for day, and the soothing cream is alright but has a stickier consistency that I don’t like as much.

    "body": "Hey, everybody!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I've previously made a post about allergies and allergy testing. I wanted to make a secondary post regarding common allergens and Asian skincare. My allergy-ridden and eczema destroyed face really loved AB and most of the products, but I've definitely had to learn a few things before just jumping in. Hopefully, this will help others who suffer from the same issues!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll start by saying that most allergens are **very** **specific** to your area. Your allergist, dermatologist, pulmonologist, or primary care doctor is the best place to go if you feel you need an allergy test. I've known people who are deathly allergic to some tree pollen, but not others. Your mileage will 100% vary here! Use this guide as a jumping-off point to assess your products, but don't use it as an exhaustive list of all possible allergens.\n\nI'm not a doctor, I'm rehashing what I have learned. I'll have random examples in the headers. Allergens listed are those I've seen in my products, although an extra one may slip in here or there.\n\n# What is an allergen? Why do allergies happen?\n\nAllergies are caused by an overreaction of your immune system due to antigens. Antigens can be inhaled, eaten, or touched. Occasionally they're even made by you! Hooray, autoimmune disorders!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen an antigen enters your body, it releases antibodies (IgE's) to combat that threat. These IgE's then go and bind to immune cells, including Eosinophils, Neutrophils, Basophils, Mast Cells, and more. Histamine is produced by Mast Cells and Basophils. This causes the majority of the traditional symptoms that you feel, such as allergic rhinitis. Mast cells are most commonly found in your nose and mouth (along with others), meaning that your inhaled or eaten allergen will cause the Mast Cells to begin producing the response.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are also Interleukins and their role in allergies are still being researched. There is also a bajillion of them, so I don't feel comfortable writing anything about them when I don't understand what they are. But, some (all?) play a role in allergic responses. However, what I *do* know is that histamine controls many Il's and cytokines. And maybe they play a role in allergies? Or maybe they don't. So...that's it for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAtopic dermatitis can often occur without an extreme histamine response. An overproduction of one type of cells, such as eosinophil or basophil, can occur without the traditional 'allergic reaction' that we recognize. Itchy, red, flaky, peeling skin is a good sign of atopic dermatitis but it can also be caused by direct environmental allergies. Always spot test your skincare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimply taking antihistamines *may* solve the problem for your particular case. Or it may not. Everyone is different. Some people only develop allergies to one or two things, others to multiple. For some, simply avoiding too much time in the grass is enough. For others, they are itchy and peeling from Spring till Fall. The point is that allergies look different in each person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I'm allergic to birch pollen and stone fruits, is this connected? Is cross-reactivity real?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes to both!  It's not a rule, however, with many people never experiencing issues with cross reactivity.\n\nWe see this most commonly in latex and banana allergies. The two proteins involved in either are so similar that it causes an allergy. Another common example is ragweed allergy and melon allergy. Or Calendula and ragweed. Birch allergy often ties to stone fruits. Mugwort often causes reactions with anise seed and veggies.\n\nI added this in as a reminder to always patch test your products. Even if it isn't necessarily a known allergy, you may still be allergic to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# But wait! I have a pollen allergy to birch pollen and I am cross-reactive to foods related to birch proteins. So I'm definitely going to react to this Birch Sap Toner, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell...I'm not sure. Maybe? Maybe not!  Because these products have been treated by boiling, steaming, pressing, diluting, preserving, etc., they may or may not have any of that allergen left over. You may be sensitive to the *concentration* of an oil or extract, but not the *allergen.* It's possible to get a little bit of that allergen in your skincare once, but not the next time. And further, the allergy to pollen may not have an effect on how you handle birch sap.\n\nThe process in which we refine our skincare can destroy the proteins that would cause an allergic reaction. This is similar to highly refined peanut oil being ok for people with peanut allergies. I wouldn't take any chances and if you do, go in with the understanding that you may still have a reaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# But I just tried it and I'm ok. Why haven't I reacted if I'm allergic?\n\nThis is likely due to the concentration, extraction process, or further dilution. Additionally, if you have a specific type of reaction, simply putting it on your skin *may not* give you the same reaction as inhaling the pollen due to the low quantity. Concentration is incredibly important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Extract vs. Oils\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extracts -** Super common in skincare, especially Asian beauty. These are usually cold-pressed or soaked in alcohol or water and diluted. An extract that is high on the ingredient list may cause allergies, but if it is further down it may not. Cold-pressed can be worse as more of the proteins are leftover. Be wary of 'unrefined' oils or extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Oils-** Often called essential oils, these are highly concentrated extracts made by steam distilling the leaves, roots, and flowers. The liquid remnants from this steaming process are the \"essential\" oils, which are fragrant and the cause of many irritants in skincare. These can cause issues in smaller amounts because of their potency. At the same time, the distillation can destroy the proteins that cause allergies. Fragrances aren't desired because they're irritating, but not *necessarily* allergy-inducing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Common Allergens\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Grasses and Weeds**\n\n(not all are necessary in skincare, but added just in case)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* sweet vernal grass\n* Mugwort/Wormwood\n* Saltwort/Russian Thistle/Tumbleweed\n* Pigweed/Amaranth\n* Quailbush/Lenscale/Scale\n* Goosefoot/Lambsquarter\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Trees**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Oak\n* Birch\n* Juniper\n* Willow\n* Maple\n* Elm\n* Olive Tree (not the olive itself!)\n* Alder\n* Melaleuca/Tea Tree\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Flowers/Perennial Plants**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Yarrow\n* Feverfew\n* Daisy/Chamomile (maybe bisabolol?)\n* Borage (and their seed oil)\n* Chickweed\n* Sunflower/Arnica\n* Chrysanthemum\n* Jasmine\n* Lemon Balm\n* Black, White, Green Tea (usually contact with the leaf, but added just in case)\n* Witch Hazel\n* Hollyhock\n* Many more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nuts**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Almond, including sweet and bitter\n* Argan\n* Brazil nut\n* Cashew\n* Hazelnut\n* Kola\n* Kukui\n* Macadamia\n* Tamanu\n* Marula\n* Shea? (The jury is still out on this one)\n* Lupini Bean (Added due to cross-reactivity. Thank you, u/Snap__Dragon!)\n* and many, *many* more! Be careful out there, my nut-averse friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other (Preservatives, Metals, etc.)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Mushrooms\n* Citrus fruits, oils, and seeds\n* Lycopene\n* Snail extract (dust mite allergy)\n* Nickle (applicators or containers)\n* Sulfates\n* Isopropyl butylcarbamate\n* Methylisothiazolinone\n* Methyldibromoglutaronitrile\n* Parabens\n* Propylene Glycol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nDon't immediately throw away anything.\n\nIf you're worried about your skin and you don't know what's causing it, start with going to the basics. Start with a simple face wash or micellar water, allergy-approved moisturizer, and sunscreen. Introduce your products back one by one in weekly intervals. Longer intervals may be necessary.\n\nKeep a food diary.\n\nEnsure that your allergies are not environmental.\n\nIf you have environmental allergies,[this is a great website](https://www.pollen.com/).\n\n[This one is also great](https://www.skinsafeproducts.com/) if you're worried about your skincare and would like to check ingredients or safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd also like to plug the [National Eczema Association](https://nationaleczema.org/).",

This is a different type of allergic reaction than the classic type 1 you have detailed here, which is the type of immediate reaction people typically get to pollen, food, latex, or drugs. \n\nSo you could apply something Monday and see the rash Tuesday...or Wednesday. Because this process is mediated by a different, slower immune system pathway, the allergy can continue to develop after the offending product is removed. And it can show up in a different area than where you applied it. An allergen in a nail product may manifest as a rash on eyelids or face. So this is why avoiding unnecessary fragrances and oils is preferable to just assuming it’s ok if you don’t get a rash right away, in the area you applied a product, after testing on your arm. And why avoiding scented hand soap and hand cream  is a good idea too. \n\n\nhttps://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/symptoms\n\n\n https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/patch-testing-rash  \n\nhttps://www.aad.org/public/diseases/eczema/types/contact-dermatitis/symptoms",

    "body": "Why does strain X medicate this condition while strain y medicates this one? Why does this strain make me sleepy while this one makes me energized??\n\nFirst my disclaimer. Have y’all heard of sativa energizing and indica making you sleepy? THROW THAT OUT THE WINDOW. This has NEVER been proven. It’s a myth! We thought this when we had limited research on cannabis. But now we know that sativa CAN make you sleepy (blue dream ;) and indicas can make you energized. The only thing that sativa vs indica vs hybrid really does is make the plant grow a certain way. Sativa dare airy and long, some sativa as even kinda look like regi, despite the quality. This is why we don’t have many purely sativa stains. Indica is very dense and short. Hybrids are mixed. \n\nWelcome friends, to the world of terpenes.  They are in all organic and natural material. Have you ever heard of consuming mango to boost your high ? This is for 2 reasons: mango contains the ‘bliss molecule’ named anandamide. This molecule is also present in cannabis. It’s responsible for (omg) the blissful sensations/ euphoria. Another reason mango boosts your high is because mango is jam packed with terpenes! \n\nTerpenes are kinda like scents. MAGICAL SCENTS. They are what make weed so medically beneficial. They are what allows weed to smell like skunk, blueberry, or urine (fr). Each terpene offers different effects when consumed with thc, and each terpene can change effects when combined with other terpenes. \n\n\n\nI’ve listed some photos above, and even some terpene content sheets for two different strains. Notice how the two strains contain different amounts of different terpenes. \n\n\nTerpenes aren’t the only reason weed is medically beneficial, and they aren’t the only thing that ‘fine tunes’ your high, but I thought this would be an easy first info dump. Weed is still very unknown to us, and while our scientists have been studying they fuck out of it, there is still so much we have yet to understand. \n\n\nNow the SAME science that supports why weed is medically beneficial ALSO supports what a lot of people like to hate on. Essential oils and using natural plants IS MEDICALLY BENEFICIAL. Nature can help cure and relieve natural things, BUT it cannot be used to help serious things. This is the reason most people hate on the ‘essential oils’ people, because SOME like to think they can treat terminal illnesses by rubbing oil on feet. I actually don’t believe that people think like that, but that is always the argument as to why people dislike essential oils people. Anyways moving on\n\nLavender: it’s very known for its calming, sedative, and anti anxiety effects. (IDC IF YOU DONT BELIEVE IT THE SCIENCE IS THERE) this is because lavender is very abundant in the terpene ‘Linalool’\n\nIf you like the effects of lavender or want to try strains with linalool, look for strains like or related to:\nLavender haze, LA confidential(snoops strain), Do-si-dos, amnesia haze, granddaddy purp.  There are many more strains high in Linalool, these are just some of the more popular ones. You can kinda guess if a strain is high on Linalool based on color too, but this is very unreliable! If you’re good at differentiating blue vs purple, you can see if the bud contains purple and it will be more likely to contain Linalool. \n\n\nChamomile: the abundant terpene in chamomile is called bisabolol. Chamomile is known for its, anti anxiety, mood relaxing, uplifting,Anti-inflammatory, anti pain,and even its immune system supporting qualities. \n\nBisabolol is actually fairly common in skin care now. It’s anti inflammatory effects make it amazing to apply topically, and it’s also said to reduce dark spots and even out skin tone. \n\nBubba strains, dolato, cereal milk, chemdog, and some alien strains all contain high bisabolol. \n\n\nLimonene: found in a lot of citrus fruits and plants. Known for energizing, anti anxiety, uplifting, floaty type of feeling. \n\nStrains high in this terpene include: diesel strains, piss strains, lemon/citrus strains\nI love these strains as preworkout! I can’t consume caffeine, so instead I grab some diesel ;)\n\nThis is barely any info at all about terpenes, but I think I’ve included enough to at leach teach something. \n\nIf you’re using weed to medicate or just want to fine tune your high. Look at terpenes!\n\nI recently found out they make concentrated terpenes. I bought limonene at a smoke shop and sprayed some on my weed. Definitely worth it.",

What is energetic effect?\nYour heartbeat races, your body will be filled with energy. Your adrenaline may go up. I suggest if you’re sensitive to anxiety with cannabis, only consume energetic strains before you do something that gets rid of energy. \n\nI personally become uncomfortable if I smoke an energizing strain before doing a relaxing activity. I NEED to get the energy out. \n\nMy preworkout is diesel strains. I like limonene terpenes for working out.

    "body": "So, Superdrug brought out a Calm Skin range at the end of last year. [It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all £2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‭Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‭Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‭Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‭Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‭Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‭Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‭Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‭Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‭Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‭Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‭Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‭Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‭Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‭Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‭(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‭Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‭Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‭Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop. Sinks in pretty quickly.\n\n**Scent:** Light floral\n\n**Overall Experience:** Help, I really like this. It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot? \n\nSalicylic acid isn't just a chemical exfoliant, it's also anti-inflammatory, which would make it calming on inflammation. Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

    "body": "\n\nOk I planned that I was going to wait for atleast two weeks before I came up with a review for the product but recently I noticed following things so I thought I need to share with you.\n\nBefore a quick history of my skin with vitamin C. My skin is generally dull with no bright yellow tint and also has textures from acne scars and acne spots and very very sensitive and acne prone.\n\n• The one vitamin C that worked the best in terms of brightening was the Ordinary Vitamin C 23 suspension. I had an instant glow up. Skin looked a bit golden but bright. But did nothing to help darkspot reduction. And more importantly I was intolerant of the product. It had a tingling effect almost irresistibly itchy and broke me out many a occasion. And I had to throw it out for that reason and also it oxided too fast.\n\n• Then I used the Ordinary's Ascorbyl Glucoside 12 and it didnt break me out. But also didnt give me that glow up that the other one did but in long term I noticed my skin dullness improving and it's oxided at all. Although it had a tingling effect in the initial uses but it slowly went out.\n\n• I used the og Klairs vit c serum from my sisters skincare and I was intolerant to that as went. It was too strong for me.\n\n• Lastly my current one is from BOJ. It's really doing nothing exceptional but I am ok because I now am not willing to use strong ingredients. And the centella in it is helping with calmness and I layer a lot so that's ok.\n\nBut I saw the peak brightening effect with the first one and I always wanted to include vitamin C but in a safer way. So I wanted Caudelie serum to work for my sensitive skin without breaking me out. I wanted the Viniferine, an antioxidant from Caudelie that they claim to be 62 times more effective than Vit C and the Bisabolol to help with sensitivity. Obviously I wanted it to work on the dark spots as well.\n\nComing to my first impression, ,\n\nFragrance: It has a strong fragrance like the old-timey skincare products. To my notes it smells like sour grapes crushed in something lactonic like milk. The first time I tried I hated it and it was a bit revolting for me but I think after several uses, it has grown on me. My nose is unaffected now.\n\nTexture: It's a milky tecture but not at all thick as it looks but also not too runny. It's smooth with no grains at all and it absorbes to the skin really fast.\n\nI used that after cleansing, and followed by round lab dokdo lotion. I stopped using all other actives and products except the avene and soothing serums that just has mugwort or centella but at different times and not with caudelie. AndI refrigerate it.\n\nFirst Try:  As soon as I applied I felt the same old tingling effect and then a bit glow too but not as much as both the ordinary serums. After some time, I saw I am breaking out and I put it off and went to subdue the new inflammation.\n\nNext few tries: The tingling effect was there and rather increased but I didn't break out. Also I noticed a shine and but nothing for dark spots and pigmentation. I noticed a healthy skin as well but only if use it at night time before going to bed.\n\nLast few tries till now: This is where everything went downhill. I noticed new closed comodones on my cheeks and almost ready to flare into acnes and eventually into acne scars and spots. And this morning i woke up to new breakout one of them really big , red and painful and no treatment is working. Others are already gone to become acne spots already post treatment. Again no changes to pigmentation.\n\nI am so devastated, all the hardwork I did to get rid of textures and I was on my way to get a softer skin, it's all gone in waste. My skin is back with those tectures and scars ane even more on this time. And now I have even more dark spots than what I had when I started it.\n\nThis is putting me in a conflict position if or not I continuously use it or not. I will think about it after gettting rid of the current breakouts. But let's see.\n\nVerdict: The glow and healthy looking thing is honestly the best thing about it. But it's also temporary and also it does nothing to pigmentation atleast what I see from my use so far. I have other serum work faster on dark spots. But someone with textures it is a bit off and there's a lot to compromise. So you need to strike a balance brightening with even textures. It is definitely an individual thing.\n\nPricepoint: It's definitely not value for money and it way way off. At that price point, I don't think you will notice a big of a difference. It's just a serum that gives a temporary glow and hydration but there's a ton of them in the market that can do better with a franction of its price. But I do know why the public loves it, anyone buying a product or service at that price will ofc want to make it work and psychologically see it work as a placebo effect. Dont get me wrong you do see a positive change but trust me it's not the peak change you will ever get. Simply because I looked brighter with other vit c serums. \n\nShould you buy it? Only if you have budget to take the risky. Because trust me it is a big risk. Also if other vitamin c works for you, may be you dont need this. This is very much similar to that. Save the money and get a good hairdo or something for an actual noticable change.",

I would not call it a miracle product since general redness reduction in cheeks seems to be temporary but PIE has drastically reduced in the last month (when I started using it).",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo start off, this is a anti-acne cleanser by an India co, Yuderma - I have been using this for 2 months+. My dermatologist who I saw for my first acne appointment in years, recommended AHA glow face wash but I asked her for an alternative. I had already used it for a month and frankly it left my skin too dry, had no effect on blackheads and minor acne. She then recommended Acnelex. I went to the pharmacy and checked out the Ingredient list:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/m976JxN\n\n*Aqua, Decyl Glucoside,* ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate, Mandelic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Oatmeal powder, Green Tea Extract, Aquaxyl, Kaolin, Witch Hazel, Tea Tree Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Bisabolol, Eucalyptus oil, Spearmint oil Sodium Gluconate.***\n\nI thought this was too good to be true, they claim that the  ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate (Azelaic cid)*** and ***Oatmeal*** in the formula are procured from UK  & Swiss labs (The ingredient list on their website seems older & in need of update)  I still went in with zero expectations.\n\nIts a creamy cleanser like Cerave or Krave Matcha Hemp; you need to activate it with water and it lathers slowly. It cleans VERY WELL, Unlike AHA Glow which leaves skin dry with a soapy tackiness. During this time, I was using Azelaic Acid 10% on active inflammatory acne so I can't vouch for its anti-acne action but they claim on their website that it combats mild acne. I started Tret for cystic acne a month after I started using this. It is very gentle, very soothing and very very hydrating, I use this day and night.  Skin looks really refreshed and clean, inflammation is diminished and before I started Tret this really removed and helped bring oiliness down. My face feels plump and plush after using it, quite the opposite of what cleansers like Neutrogena and Clinique have done in the past. For the first month I was only using a rose toner, plain aloe vera gel, sunscreen and Exazel N for scars because the cystic & inflammatory acne was soooo active and terrifying. It was puzzling, I was super hydrated and not dry after cleansing.\n\n I looked up Aquaxyl\n\n>Aquaxyl™ offers the 3D hydration hydraconcept for circulation of moisture throughout all skin layers and boosting of hyaluronic acid. The skin barrier is reinforced in 24 hours by limiting water loss. Results are softer smoother skin in 28 days with normal desquamation and smoothing of fine lines. Aquaxyl™ strengthens the skin barrier, promotes healthy differentiation of the epidermis and refills the internal water reservoirs (hyaluronic acid, ceramides and aquaporin boosters)\n\nThe only other face wash that has been on par is the Krave Match Hemp one, its is super hydrating and soothing for oily skin with a tendency for pores and persistent mild acne. Quite often oily skin also tends to be inflamed, which leads to excess sebum and acne; ironically most anti acne cleansers aggravate it. I used the Krave cleanser but didn't repurchase because its too pricey and customs add to it. Acnelex is the closest dupe I have found to it.\n\n**Moreover**\n\nI underwent a laser and 2 peels during the past 2 months and after each I was told not to wash my face for 3-5 days in case my skin would get red, peeling, inflamed etc , no actives or moisturisers to allow for desquamation. BUT I was also asked to wear a sunscreen everyday. I just couldn't follow this instruction. I was not to use oils because the dead skin need to dry and come off, so I couldn't use an oil cleanser or Cetaphil which which would also soften cells. I used Acnelex after a day, smaller quantity and very gently.\n\nIt did NOT cause any discomfort on raw, post. treatment skin! Perhaps the *Oatmeal,* *Green Tea etc*. are in higher dose or of good quality but it was a breeze. It actually felt very soothing and conditioning and I now think my post service bounce back might have been due to washing my face twice a day - this cleanser actually feels really soothing & calming the more inflamed your skin is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail Price: 699.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

    "body": "Hey!\n\nAfter a couple of test batches I've created a formula for a very lightweight, slightly translucent face cream perfectly matching my skin needs (oily and sensitive). It's velvety, has a nice cooling effect, absorbs relatively quickly (spreads well for a while, then for a minute or so my skin is still a little \"wet\" but not oily or slimy and the finish feels powdery but looks a tiny bit shiny). I'm pretty confident that the formula is stable, I've tested it by centrifugation and a \"final test batch\" is two months old now, pH is stable, no visible viscosity, color and smell change. Ingredients in square brackets are optional, as they were not included in a \"final test batch\". Fruit extracts used contribute to the scent of the cream. I would say it is quite comparable to clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel. I've included comments for some ingredients to explain their purpose.

    "body": "It's a unique smell. Some people find it unpleasant and overwhelming, while most weed enthusiasts find it very calming and enjoyable. Just like any other plant, pot has components that are responsible for its unique aroma and flavor.\nThose components are terpenes, aromatic molecules secreted inside the tiny resin glands of cannabis flowers.\n\n\nTerpenes produce a citrusy aroma in some strains, fruity and sweet notes in others and, while some may smell and taste like lavender, others can be more earthy and pungent. Certain strains even smell like cheese. But, it’s not all about the smell.\nTerpenes also produce a wide range of medical effects and there are at least 80-100 terpenes unique to cannabis—the combination of terpenes, cannabinoids and optimal dosage is responsible for the entire success of medical cannabis.\n\nWhat are terpenes?\n\nTerpenes are organic chemicals constituents of essential oils produced by most plants, and even some animals such as swallowtail butterflies and termites. Terpenes are volatile aromatic molecules—molecules that evaporate easily.\nTerpenoids are derivatives of terpenes that have additional atoms due to oxidation, which is what happens when a cannabis flower is dried and cured. The two terms are often used interchangeably and they are pretty much similar in a way.\nTerpenes have two very important roles in every plant’s life: They are the primary component of resin and they protect the flowers from predators.\nMany industries are using terpenes for making essential oils, health and beauty products—they are even used for making perfumes. Synthetic terpenes are used for flavoring and as food additives.\nHere are a few more fun facts about terpenes: Natural rubber is made of them, as are many steroids. Maple syrup contains about 300 different terpenes, which is why it’s so yummy.\nBut what about cannabis?\nTerpenes give each strain its unique smell and taste. Not only that but they also enhance the health effects of cannabis by influencing how we process cannabinoids.\nLet’s explore this in more detail.\n\nHow terpenes influence the high\n\nWhat we usually consume from cannabis are flowers.\nAnd just like all other flowers, cannabis flowers have their own recognizable scent.\nAs I’ve mentioned earlier, there are about 120 terpenes in cannabis.\nThey are synthesized in the tiny resin glands of cannabis flowers alongside cannabinoids like THC and CBD.\nSome of the common cannabis terpenes can be found in other plants, while others are exclusive to cannabis.\nBut, it’s not all about the smell, as terpenes also have many therapeutic properties: They interact with the endocannabinoid system and assist cannabinoids in entering the bloodstream through a process called the entourage effect.\nMyrcene, for instance, increases cell permeability and allows cannabinoids to get absorbed faster than they would get on their own.\nLimonene is responsible for increasing serotonin levels, a neurotransmitter in charge of our mood. This explains why different strains may have different effects on our mood. The whole cannabis experience is suddenly starting to make sense, right?\n\nTerpenes and the “Entourage Effect” explained\n\nThe “Entourage Effect” is a term coined by S. Ben-Shabat and Raphael Mechoulam back in 1998, to represent the biological synergy of cannabinoids and other compounds like flavonoids and terpenes. \nSimply put, when we ingest terpenes with cannabinoids (a likely scenario when consuming a whole-plant product), they form a synergistic relationship, playing off on each other’s strengths.\nThis symbiosis between cannabinoids and terpenes is what gives cannabis its special powers, as it improves the absorption of cannabinoids, overcomes bacterial defense mechanisms and minimizes side effects.\n\nAt what temperature do terpenes break down?\n\nEvery terpene breaks down at a different temperature: Some smaller terpenes will start breaking down at 21°C and others may begin to break down at 37°C.\nBoiling temperatures of terpenes also vary, but generally they start boiling at 155°C. For example, myrcene boils at 166°C.\n\nWhat are the proven health benefits of terpenes?\n\nSome terpenes are very effective in relieving stress, others are great when you need to relax, and some are awesome for boosting focus. There are many options here, as you’ll have a chance to see in the next few minutes.\nTake myrcene, one of the most abundant terpenes in cannabis, which is responsible for inducing sleep. Or limonene, the citrusy messenger in charge for making us feel uplifted after smoking a joint.\nIn recent years, cannabis terpenes have become an important subject of scientific research.\nIt was Jürg Gertsch who first noticed the ability of beta-caryophyllene to bind to CB2 receptors, calling it “a dietary cannabinoid”.\nHe also concluded that all green vegetables that contain this terpene are extremely beneficial for human use.\nShortly after that, Dr. Ethan Russo published an article in 2011, in the British Journal of Pharmacology, and pointed out to the therapeutic properties of terpenes in cannabis, especially those missing in cannabis products that only contain a single molecule (CBD oil as a primary example). \nDr. Russo also described the cannabinoid-terpene interaction as a “synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections”.\nFurther research discovered that terpenes, terpenoids and cannabinoids all have the ability to kill respiratory pathogens, for instance, the MRSA virus.\n\nList of 15 most commonly found terpenes in cannabis\n\nSince there are around 120 terpenes in cannabis, it would take us a while to go over each of them in great detail.\nInstead, here are some of the most abundant terpenes found in cannabis flowers today.\n\nMyrcene\n\nMyrcene is the most abundant terpene in cannabis, which is where it’s mostly found in nature. In fact, one study showed that myrcene makes up as much as 65% of total terpene profile in some strains.\nThe smell of Myrcene often reminds us of earthy, musky notes, similar to cloves. It also has a fruity, red grape-like aroma.\nStrains that contain 0.5% of this terpene are usually indicas, packed full of sedative effects. Myrcene is also supposedly useful in reducing inflammation and chronic pain, which is why it’s usually recommended as a supplement during cancer treatments.\nStrains that are rich in myrcene are Skunk XL, White Widow, and Special Kush.\nBonus tip: If you want to experience a stronger buzz from marijuana, eat a mango about 45 minutes before smoking. Mango contains a significant amount of myrcene, so eating it before consuming cannabis will strengthen the effects of THC and increase the absorption rate of other cannabinoids\n\n\nLimonene\n\nLimonene is the second most abundant terpene in cannabis, but not all strains necessarily have it.\nAs the name itself says, limonene produces a citrusy smell that resembles lemons, which is no surprise as all citrus fruits contain large amounts of this compound. Limonene is used in cosmetics and also in cleaning products.\nWhen it comes to its therapeutic purposes, limonene is a mood-booster and a stress-crusher. Researchers also found it to have anti-fungal and antibacterial properties, with one study even announcing that limonene may play a role in reducing tumor size. \nGetting a hold of this terpene is easy — strains that have “lemon” or “sour” in their name are usually rich in limonene.\nSome good examples of these are O.G. Kush, Sour Diesel, Super Lemon Haze, Durban Poison, Jack Herer, and Jack the Ripper.\n\nLinalool\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what makes cannabis smell the way it does, myrcene and linalool are to blame. With its spicy and floral notes, this terpene is one of the most abundant in the majority of strains out there and, together with myrcene produces that pungent and spicy scent.\nLinalool can also be found in lavender, mint, cinnamon, and coriander. What’s interesting is that just like those aromatic herbs, linalool also produces sedation and relaxation.\nPatients suffering from arthritis, depression, seizures, insomnia and even cancer, have all found relief with this amazing terpene.\nSome well-known linalool strains are Amnesia Haze, Special Kush, Lavender, LA Confidential, and OG Shark.\n\n\n\n\nCaryophyllene\n\nBest known for its spicy and peppery note, caryophyllene is also found in black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and spices like oregano, basil, and rosemary.\nBeta-caryophyllene binds to CB2 receptors, which makes it an ingredient in anti-inflammatory topicals and creams. Caryophyllene is the only terpene that binds to cannabinoid receptors.\nBesides its analgesic and anxiolytic properties, some studies have found that caryophyllene has a very promising role in alcohol rehabilitation.\nA group of scientists performed research on mice and found that this terpene reduces the voluntary intake of alcohol. They even recommended caryophyllene for treating alcohol withdrawal symptoms.\nStrains like Super Silver Haze, Skywalker and Rock Star are all rich in caryophyllene.\n\nAlpha-pinene and Beta-pinene\n\nThese twin terpenes smell like pine trees which is also where they can be found in large amounts. Other plants rich in pinene include rosemary, orange peels, basil, parsley and cannabis, of course.\nLike many other, pinene terpenes have an anti-inflammatory effect on humans.\nThey also help improve the airflow and respiratory functions, while also helping reduce memory loss related to excessive THC consumption. I know that this can sound weird because we’re talking about cannabis, but if the strain is rich in alpha and beta pinene, it can actually help with asthma.\nPinene is also beneficial for patients suffering from arthritis, Crohn’s Disease, and even cancer.\nStrains that are great sources of pinene are Jack Herer, Strawberry Cough, Blue Dream, Island Sweet Skunk, Dutch Treat, and Romulan.\n\nAlpha-bisabolol\n\nAlpha-bisabolol (also known as levomenol and bisabolol) has a pleasant floral aroma and is also present in chamomile flower and candeia tree.\nThis terpene found its use primarily in the cosmetics industry, but lately, it has caught the attention of researchers for its supposed medical benefits.\nAlpha-bisabolol proved to be effective in treating bacterial infections and wounds and is a great antioxidant with anti-irritation and analgesic properties.\nIt can be found in strains like Harle-Tsu, Pink Kush, Headband, OG Shark, and ACDC.\n\nEucalyptol\n\nAlso known as cineole, eucalyptol is the primary terpene of the eucalyptus tree. It produces minty tones but most cannabis strains only have it in traces. On average, it makes up around 0.06% of the complete cannabis terpene profile.\nEucalyptol is extensively used in cosmetics as well as medicine. When it comes to its medical value, eucalyptol relieves pain but also slows down the growth of bacteria and fungus.\nAlthough it is still in the early stages of research, this terpene has shown some promising effects on Alzheimer’s as well.\nYou can get your daily dose of eucalyptol with strains like Super Silver Haze and Headband.\n\nTrans-nerolidol\n\nThis one is a secondary terpene, found mostly in flowers like jasmine, lemongrass, and tea tree oil. Its smell is a mixture of rose, lemon and apple tones, and can be described in general as both woody and citrusy.\nTrans-nerolidol is best known for its antiparasitic, antioxidant, antifungal, anticancer and antimicrobial properties.\nStrains like Jack Herer, Sweet Skunk, and Skywalker OG are all rich in nerolidol.\n\nHumulene\n\nHumulene is the first terpene found in hops and its aroma is made up of earthy, woody and spicy notes.\nBesides cannabis, it can be also found in clove, sage, and black pepper.\nIt has many medical properties. Also, it proved to be effective in suppressing appetite, which could make it a potential weight loss tool.\nFurthermore, like many other terpenes mentioned above, humulene also reduces inflammation, relieves pain and fights bacterial infections.\nYou can find humulene in strains like White Widow, Headband, Girl Scout Cookies, Sour Diesel, Pink Kush and Skywalker OG.\n\nDelta 3 Carene\n\nThis terpene is found in a number of plants, like rosemary, basil, bell peppers, cedar and pine. Its aroma is sweet and resembles the smell of cypress.\nWhen it comes to its medical properties, Delta 3 carene seems to be beneficial in healing broken bones, which is a beacon of hope for patients suffering from osteoporosis, arthritis and even fibromyalgia.\nInterestingly enough, Delta 3 carene stimulates our memory and helps with memory retention. This is a major point in finding a cure for Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\nCamphene\n\nThe best way to describe the smell of camphene is fir needles, musky earth, and damp woodlands. Camphene’s aroma is often mistaken with myrcene, which is that trademark marijuana smell as most of us know it.\nCamphene has great potential in medicine. When mixed with vitamin C, it becomes a powerful antioxidant and it is widely used in conventional medicine as a topical for skin issues like eczema and psoriasis.\nIts greatest potential, however, lies in its ability to lower the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, both of which are connected to many cardiovascular diseases.\nCamphene is present in Ghost OG, Strawberry Banana and Mendocino Purps.\n\nBorneol\n\nBorneol, with its herbal minty scent, can be found in herbs like rosemary, mint, and camphor.\nThis terpene is a good natural insect repellent, which makes it great for preventing diseases like the West Nile virus, which is passed by ticks, fleas, mosquitoes etc. One study even found that borneol kills breast cancer cells. \nStrains high in borneol are Amnesia Haze, Golden Haze, K13 Haze.\n\nTerpineol\n\nThe aroma of terpineol can be described as floral-like, reminiscent of lilacs, apple blossom, and a hint of lemon. Terpineol tastes like anise and mint.\nTerpineol has a pleasant scent, similar to lilac, and is a common ingredient in perfumes, cosmetics, and food.\nIt is a well-known relaxant and is usually the one responsible for the notorious couch-lock effect which is often connected with indica strains. Medical benefits of terpineol also include antibiotic and antioxidant properties.\nIt can be found Girl Scout Cookies, Jack Herer, and OG Kush.\n\nValencene\n\nThis terpene got its name from sweet Valencia oranges — where it’s present in large amounts. With its sweet citrusy aroma and flavor, it’s also used as an insect repellant.\nEven though we don’t know much about valencene, we do know that it can be found in strains like Tangie and Agent Orange.\n\nGeraniol\n\nBesides cannabis, geraniol can be found in lemons and tobacco. Its smell resembles a mixture of rose grass, peaches, and plums.\nIt’s usually used in aromatic bath products and body lotions.\nGeraniol has shown a lot of potential as a neuroprotectant and antioxidant.\nIt’s present in strains like Amnesia Haze, Great White Shark, Afghani, Headband, Island Sweet Skunk, OG Shark and Master Kush.",

    "body": "I have tried these products from the brand, and after enough time has passed, I think it's time to share my thoughts.\n\n**About my skin:**  \nHighly reactive, Dry and sensitive, prone to eczema and acne and fungal acne.\n\n  \n**Products I've tried:**\n\n1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n  \n**Review:**\n\n**1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, propanediol, butylene glycol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, ascorbyl glucoside, butyl methoxydibenzoy|methane, diethylaminoHydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, centella asiatica Extract, ascorbic acid, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, polygonum Cuspidatum root extract, ammonium acryloyldimethyl taurate/VP copolymer, dicaprylyl carbonate, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) root extract, gold, disodium edta, pentapeptide 4, camellia sinensis leaf extract, glutathione, chamomilla recutita (Matricaria)flower extract, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitol, rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf extract. \n\nPackaging:   \nAs seen in the picture, really compact and travel-friendly, and has a nozzle-like end, which I love.\n\nTexture:   \nAs it claims, but less watery and more gel-like. Blends quickly and absorbs easily.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nEye stinging:  \nNo\n\nThoughts:  \nThis sunscreen uses decent sun filters and provides good protection. Haven't experienced any tanning since I started using it, but my sun exposure isn't much to begin with. I really love how easy it is to apply this sunscreen and how quickly it absorbs.  \nBUT it can irritate your skin because of the sun filters used. I have noticed that this sunscreen stings a little when applied near the area where my skin tends to get irritated quickly, like my chin and around my mouth. But the irritation subsides in 2-3 minutes, and after that, I haven't experienced any irritation.  \nOther than the irritation, there isn't anything about this sunscreen I dislike, and in terms of the finish and comfort, this has to be one of the best sunscreens that I have tried\n\nRating:  \n4/5 (if you have really irritated skin, this isn't the right fit for you)\n\n  \n**2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nFormularx's typical packaging hasn't experienced any breakage with it yet, but I wouldn't say it's travel-friendly.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight, somewhere between a cream and a gel\n\nFA safe:  \nNo, nope, not at all (contains cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate as its 6th, 7th, 8th ingredient respectively, and also linoleic acid. All these ingredients can trigger FA)\n\nThoughts:  \nI dislike this moisturiser so much that I don't even want to write this part, but well. It triggered my FA like crazy, and when I got this moisturiser, I wasn't aware that I had fungal acne, so you can imagine what I went through when I woke up with a bunch of spots on my face every. single. day.  \nSomehow realised it's this moisturizer maybe, so stopped using it every day, and started wearing it under my make-up (basically once every 2 weeks) and it STILL gave me FA even though I never wore it for more than 4 hours.  \nBut I have to admit, the glow and hydration this one gave me was unmatched. I didn't experience any dryness with it, and this didn't feel \"heavy\". I am not sure if this one gave me acne or not, since my skin was at its worst when I used it.  \nCurrently using it as hand cream haha.\n\nRating: 2/5 (because of hydration and feel. If you don't have FA or really oily or acne prone skin, you can try it out, otherwise avoid imo)\n\n  \n**3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nthis one feels sturdier than the barrier relief moisturiser's packaging, but the latter was bought in 2024, so I can only assume they improved their packaging. Love the colour.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight and gel-like. Non-greasy and fast absorbing.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nThoughts:  \nOkay, there's nothing in the ingredients list that I find concerning, and this moisturiser is very simple and straight to the point. I haven't tried the original malazia hydraveil (the yellow tube) but damn this moisturiser is my favourite and I love it with all my heart.  \nProvides enough hydration to keep my dry patches under bay, and at the same time does not trigger my FA. During winter, I was prescribed topical immunosuppressants because my eczema was getting so bad, and the medication somehow triggered my FA, so my skin was a battleground tbh. I ordered this recently and it's been working out well for me. In the morning, I use it as it is, but at night I mix or layer it with minimalist squalene oil.   \nOh, and it also leaves a nice glow after application! The only thing is that you have to wait a couple of minutes before and after applying it to make sure it gets absorbed properly.\n\nRating:  \n4.5/5 \n\n**4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, propanediol, butylene glycol, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, ethylhexyl triazone, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, niacinamide, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, nonapeptide-1, linoleic acid, alpha bisabolol, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, allantoin, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, phenoxyethanol, tocopherol, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin, iron oxides (Cl 77499 & Cl 77491 & CI 77492)\n\nPackaging:   \nMinimalistic look, and as you can see in the picture, it's more like a plastic tube (?) but less compact than the hydrashield sunscreen.\n\nTexture:   \nCreamy but also watery and gel-like. Feels heavy and oily :( Also tinted.\n\nFA safe:  \nNOOOPE (contains clyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol and linolenic acid)\n\nEye stinging:  \nA little.\n\nThoughts:  \nAgain, don't want to share but here we go!   \nthere is one primary concern I have with this sunscreen is that there's no sun filter in the top 5 ingredients, which makes me question the protection it provides, as most of the popular and effective sunscreens in the market have atleast 1 sun filter in the top 5 ingredients. Makes me wonder whether the brand compromised on the protection in order to give this sunscreen a moisturizing effect. But the filters present are good and non-irritating.   \nGave me FA, and it didn't have a glowy finish but rather a heavy, oily finish, which I didn't enjoy. Like at all. This sunscreen gives almost no coverage despite being tinted, and I don't think the 'tint' really shows up.  \nI guess this could be a good indoor sunscreen for someone who isn't oily or has fungal acne, but I would suggest my FA gang to stay away from this one.\n\n  \nrating:  \n2/5\n\n  \n**5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide**\n\n>**Ingredients:** Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, squalane, naicinamide, propanediol, sodium polyglutamate, ceramide np, madecassoside (centella asiatica extract), bisabolol, tocopherol acetate, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl stearate, disodium edta, xanthan gum, polyacrylate crosspolymer 6, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nAgain, this has the typical formulaRX's aluminium-like packaging, the it has a paper- like coating which feels weird to me.\n\nTexture:   \nGel-like and watery. Leaves an oily residue.\n\nFA safe:  \nYes, contains glyceryl stearate, which is in the bottom 5 ingredients of the ingredient list.\n\nThoughts:  \nIs this hydrating? Yes. But the thing is, my skin doesn't like its 'feel'. Like right after application, it kinda feels warm and icky if that makes sense. Oh, and on top of that, I leave a weird, oily and slime-y residue. It's not overwhelming, but it's there.  \nAnd because of the texture, I am unable to form a perspective on this product because it is definitely doing its job (although I don't think it has a calming effect), but the texture and the feel is off-putting. As for FA, it may or may not trigger it. In my case, it wasn't as bad as what I had experienced with their barrier relief cream, but it may still trigger some reaction.\n\nRating:  \n3/5\n\n**Now, if I had to rank the 5 products:**\n\n1. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n\n2. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n\n3. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n\n5. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n\n  \nPurchased everything from their website. Also, the ingredients list is straight from the website.",

I live in Germany and this is super helpful. \n\nNot sure if this helps, but for people in Germany looking for oils for OCM, the company [Spinnrad](http://spinnrad.de/) has a wide selection and they are pretty cheap. You can buy their products at health shops like Vitalia. I've used their Sweet almond oil for a few months and it's been working out great. \n\nAlso, I recently discovered [enaissance](http://enaissance.de/), an online store that sells oils, etc, and ships for free within Germany. Haven't tried their products yet but might order from them next time since their almond oil is cheaper than the Spinnrad one.",

    "body": "I have tried these products from the brand, and after enough time has passed, I think it's time to share my thoughts.\n\n**About my skin:**  \nHighly reactive, Dry and sensitive, prone to eczema and acne and fungal acne.\n\n  \n**Products I've tried:**\n\n1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n  \n**Review:**\n\n**1. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, propanediol, butylene glycol, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octocrylene, ascorbyl glucoside, butyl methoxydibenzoy|methane, diethylaminoHydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, centella asiatica Extract, ascorbic acid, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, polygonum Cuspidatum root extract, ammonium acryloyldimethyl taurate/VP copolymer, dicaprylyl carbonate, scutellaria baicalensis root extract, glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice) root extract, gold, disodium edta, pentapeptide 4, camellia sinensis leaf extract, glutathione, chamomilla recutita (Matricaria)flower extract, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitol, rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) leaf extract. \n\nPackaging:   \nAs seen in the picture, really compact and travel-friendly, and has a nozzle-like end, which I love.\n\nTexture:   \nAs it claims, but less watery and more gel-like. Blends quickly and absorbs easily.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nEye stinging:  \nNo\n\nThoughts:  \nThis sunscreen uses decent sun filters and provides good protection. Haven't experienced any tanning since I started using it, but my sun exposure isn't much to begin with. I really love how easy it is to apply this sunscreen and how quickly it absorbs.  \nBUT it can irritate your skin because of the sun filters used. I have noticed that this sunscreen stings a little when applied near the area where my skin tends to get irritated quickly, like my chin and around my mouth. But the irritation subsides in 2-3 minutes, and after that, I haven't experienced any irritation.  \nOther than the irritation, there isn't anything about this sunscreen I dislike, and in terms of the finish and comfort, this has to be one of the best sunscreens that I have tried\n\nRating:  \n4/5 (if you have really irritated skin, this isn't the right fit for you)\n\n  \n**2. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nFormularx's typical packaging hasn't experienced any breakage with it yet, but I wouldn't say it's travel-friendly.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight, somewhere between a cream and a gel\n\nFA safe:  \nNo, nope, not at all (contains cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate as its 6th, 7th, 8th ingredient respectively, and also linoleic acid. All these ingredients can trigger FA)\n\nThoughts:  \nI dislike this moisturiser so much that I don't even want to write this part, but well. It triggered my FA like crazy, and when I got this moisturiser, I wasn't aware that I had fungal acne, so you can imagine what I went through when I woke up with a bunch of spots on my face every. single. day.  \nSomehow realised it's this moisturizer maybe, so stopped using it every day, and started wearing it under my make-up (basically once every 2 weeks) and it STILL gave me FA even though I never wore it for more than 4 hours.  \nBut I have to admit, the glow and hydration this one gave me was unmatched. I didn't experience any dryness with it, and this didn't feel \"heavy\". I am not sure if this one gave me acne or not, since my skin was at its worst when I used it.  \nCurrently using it as hand cream haha.\n\nRating: 2/5 (because of hydration and feel. If you don't have FA or really oily or acne prone skin, you can try it out, otherwise avoid imo)\n\n  \n**3. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, propanediol, panthenol, sodium hyaluronate, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/VPcopolymer, ceramide np, ectoin, sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, sodium acetylated hyaluronate , xylityglucoside, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate , anhydroxylitol, pentylene glycol, xylitol, dicaprylyl ether, disdium edta, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nthis one feels sturdier than the barrier relief moisturiser's packaging, but the latter was bought in 2024, so I can only assume they improved their packaging. Love the colour.\n\nTexture:   \nLightweight and gel-like. Non-greasy and fast absorbing.\n\nFA safe:  \nYES!\n\nThoughts:  \nOkay, there's nothing in the ingredients list that I find concerning, and this moisturiser is very simple and straight to the point. I haven't tried the original malazia hydraveil (the yellow tube) but damn this moisturiser is my favourite and I love it with all my heart.  \nProvides enough hydration to keep my dry patches under bay, and at the same time does not trigger my FA. During winter, I was prescribed topical immunosuppressants because my eczema was getting so bad, and the medication somehow triggered my FA, so my skin was a battleground tbh. I ordered this recently and it's been working out well for me. In the morning, I use it as it is, but at night I mix or layer it with minimalist squalene oil.   \nOh, and it also leaves a nice glow after application! The only thing is that you have to wait a couple of minutes before and after applying it to make sure it gets absorbed properly.\n\nRating:  \n4.5/5 \n\n**4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++**\n\n>Ingredients: Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, propanediol, butylene glycol, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, ethylhexyl triazone, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, niacinamide, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, nonapeptide-1, linoleic acid, alpha bisabolol, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, allantoin, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, phenoxyethanol, tocopherol, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin, iron oxides (Cl 77499 & Cl 77491 & CI 77492)\n\nPackaging:   \nMinimalistic look, and as you can see in the picture, it's more like a plastic tube (?) but less compact than the hydrashield sunscreen.\n\nTexture:   \nCreamy but also watery and gel-like. Feels heavy and oily :( Also tinted.\n\nFA safe:  \nNOOOPE (contains clyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol and linolenic acid)\n\nEye stinging:  \nA little.\n\nThoughts:  \nAgain, don't want to share but here we go!   \nthere is one primary concern I have with this sunscreen is that there's no sun filter in the top 5 ingredients, which makes me question the protection it provides, as most of the popular and effective sunscreens in the market have atleast 1 sun filter in the top 5 ingredients. Makes me wonder whether the brand compromised on the protection in order to give this sunscreen a moisturizing effect. But the filters present are good and non-irritating.   \nGave me FA, and it didn't have a glowy finish but rather a heavy, oily finish, which I didn't enjoy. Like at all. This sunscreen gives almost no coverage despite being tinted, and I don't think the 'tint' really shows up.  \nI guess this could be a good indoor sunscreen for someone who isn't oily or has fungal acne, but I would suggest my FA gang to stay away from this one.\n\n  \nrating:  \n2/5\n\n  \n**5. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide**\n\n>**Ingredients:** Water, glycerin, dicaprylyl carbonate, squalane, naicinamide, propanediol, sodium polyglutamate, ceramide np, madecassoside (centella asiatica extract), bisabolol, tocopherol acetate, allantoin, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl stearate, disodium edta, xanthan gum, polyacrylate crosspolymer 6, ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPackaging:   \nAgain, this has the typical formulaRX's aluminium-like packaging, the it has a paper- like coating which feels weird to me.\n\nTexture:   \nGel-like and watery. Leaves an oily residue.\n\nFA safe:  \nYes, contains glyceryl stearate, which is in the bottom 5 ingredients of the ingredient list.\n\nThoughts:  \nIs this hydrating? Yes. But the thing is, my skin doesn't like its 'feel'. Like right after application, it kinda feels warm and icky if that makes sense. Oh, and on top of that, I leave a weird, oily and slime-y residue. It's not overwhelming, but it's there.  \nAnd because of the texture, I am unable to form a perspective on this product because it is definitely doing its job (although I don't think it has a calming effect), but the texture and the feel is off-putting. As for FA, it may or may not trigger it. In my case, it wasn't as bad as what I had experienced with their barrier relief cream, but it may still trigger some reaction.\n\nRating:  \n3/5\n\n**Now, if I had to rank the 5 products:**\n\n1. Hydraveil Hyaluronic Hydrating Gel moisturizer with Ectoin & Ceramide\n\n2. Hydrashield vitamin C & Peptide watery gel suncreen PA++++\n\n3. Beyond Hydration Glycerin Intense Hydrating Serum with Ceramide\n\n4. Sun Relief Ceramide Silk Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 50 / PA ++++\n\n5. Barrier Relief Lightweight Ceramide Moisturizer with Niacinamide\n\n  \nPurchased everything from their website. Also the ingredients list is straight from the website.",

Here are the claims:\n\n> C+C Serum uses 10% L-ascorbic acid, but rather than introducing elements that cause it to degrade, we’ve suspended it in a lightweight silicone formula away from water, heat, and light. That means it’s stable on your shelf for a full year. We also added 5% ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, an oil-soluble form of vitamin C, which complements L-ascorbic acid’s water solubility.\n\n> To up the ante, we added another incredibly powerful antioxidant, Coenzyme Q10 (otherwise known as ubiquinone) to make sure no free radical is left un-scavenged. Bisabolol, a key component of German chamomile, helps soothe and calm skin.\n\n > Put it all together and you’re left with an incredibly potent yet non-irritating antioxidant serum to help brighten, smooth, and firm your skin.\n\nIngredients list also looks pretty short and sweet... Has anyone tried this? What do you guys think? \n",

I felt patches of very mild \"tingliness\" after applying it, but by the 4th time I used it all over my face I didn't experience that anymore. (Note that I do not have sensitive skin.) I had some pigmentation from picking at a spot ~~I know I shouldn't have 😅~~ and I think the Vit C helped exfoliate it because it flaked off much quicker than I had expected it to.\n\nOverall, I really like this product.

I appreciate your listing out the ingredients too.😘\n\nThere seems to be some confusion about some of the ingredients, but you've likely heard of them already, just by different names:\n\n**Centella asiatica**. AKA as **Tiger Grass** or gotu kola, the medicinal plant **is the star of skin-soothing Cica creams,** and **madecassoside** is one of the primary, most active compounds in centella asiatica.\n\nThese ingredients are in some of the Dr Jart (and others) products that soothe the skin. BTW, **CosRX has a cica powder** that you can mix in with other products to customize them as you see fit. For example, you may not want all the ingredients that are in the base of a product because it contains irritants, fragrance of cause acne, so you could use something like squalene or hyalauonic acid as the base/carrier to mix with the cica powder which is great especially for sensitive and/or rosean skin. The jar is pretty tiny, but you don't need much.",

I had a message with someone asking me to take a picture of the ingredients, through this I noticed the ingredients on the website do NOT match what’s on the packages, it seems like more than just a different of MD or for public sale products. I have sent a message to inquire about this. Below is the difference between what is listed on medestitics website and the ingredients on the actual box. \n\n\tCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\t•\tAzelaic Acid\n\t•\tTitanium Dioxide\n\t•\tAloe barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\t•\tCopernicia cerifera Cera (instead, List Two has Euphorbia Cerifera Cera)\n\t•\tKojic Acid (List Two has Kojic Dipalmitate, which is a derivative)\n\t•\tPEG-8 Beeswax\n\t•\tAlpha-Arbutin\n\t•\tCetearyl Alcohol\n\t•\tNiacinamide\n\t•\tSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (List Two has Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, another vitamin C derivative)\n\t•\tCeteareth-25\n\t•\tBisabolol\n\t•\tMagnesium Aluminium Silicate\n\t•\tStearyl Dimethicone\n\t•\tBehenyl Alcohol\n\t•\tDisodium Ethylene Dicocamide PEG-15 Disulfate\n\t•\tSodium Lauroyl Lactylate\n\t•\tAscorbic Acid\n\t•\tCitric Acid\n\t•\tAllantoin\n\t•\tAcacia senegal Gum\n\t•\tGlyceryl Stearate Citrate\n\nWhen I asked chat gpt if any of these ingredients could change the effectiveness this was the answer:\n\nIt depends on the goal of the product. If the formula is meant for brightening and treating hyperpigmentation, losing Azelaic Acid, Alpha-Arbutin, and Niacinamide could reduce its potency. If it’s meant for acne-prone or sensitive skin, removing Bisabolol, Allantoin, and Aloe could make it harsher. However, List Two does have other effective ingredients, like Retinol, Kojic Dipalmitate, and Hexylresorcinol, which may compensate for some of the missing benefits.\n\nHowever, Skin is doing as expected and so far the same as when I had it applied in office by physician. Red and tight but very little peeling yet… I think it’ll start tomorrow. \n\n1st pic is immediately after rinsing to show my before. 2 picture are yesterday evening, skin looks the same today.\n\nOk thanks for listening to my rant 😅",

    "body": "**Full product name:** Versed Guards Up Daily Mineral Sunscreen SPF 35\n\n**Available:** Target or Versed directly online \n\n**Price:** $22 USD for 50 mL\n\n**About my skin:** Very dry, Fitzpatrick III, Rosacea, extremely sensitive skin and eyes\n\n**Climate:** SF Bay Area (so spring-like almost all year, lots of sun)\n\n**My relationship with sunscreen:** I hate suncreen and most sunscreens hate me. I can't use any of the US chemical filters and use others sparingly. I hate the smothering feeling of a lot of sunscreens and have had a lot of trouble finding ones that I tolerate. My skin is also so dry that zinc can be problematic because it's often drying/matte. I'm currently using: Kinship Self-Reflect Probiotic Sunscreen and Biossance Squalane + Zinc. I've tried (and hated) a bunch: Avene SPF 50 Mineral Suncreen, Cerave SPF 50 and SPF 30 mineral suncreens, Blue Lizard, Green Goddess etc. \n\n**Sunscreen Filters:** Zinc Oxide (15.2%)\n\n**Ingredients:** Zinc Oxide, Water/Aqua/Eau, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Diheptyl Succinate, C18-21 Alkane, Erythritol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Propanediol, Arachidyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, Coco-Glucoside, Ethyl Ferulate, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Xanthan Gum, Octyldodecyl Oleate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Sodium Hyaluronate, Crithmum Maritimum Extract, Maltodextrin, Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492).\n\n**Ingredient Callouts:**  Fragrance free, silicone free, paraben-free, alcohol-free, should be fungal-acne safe (edit: not FA safe :( )\n\nThis is an all-mineral, zinc-oxide only sunscreen. It's tinted with warm undertones, but doesn't seem to provide any sort of coverage. The color on my hand is notably different than my skintone (much warmer, less red) but it blends in very well. I don't get a white cast with this (but I am pale-ish). It doesn't cover any of my redness or give an airbrushed look like some tinted sunscreens do.\n\nTexturally, this feels somewhat like a gel moisturizer. It's silicone free so it feels fairly light on the skin once it's on. I hate the suffocating feeling of some of the high-silicone mineral sunscreens out there. The spread on this is impressive and I don't have a problem using the recommended amount and getting it to look nice. The finish is dewy/natural. It's definitely shiny at first, but tones down to look natural/hydrated. I don't find that it settles into any creases or leaves my skin too dry at the end of the day. This might move around on you if you have oily skin. I haven't had any skin irritation from using it for the past week, but will update this if I get any.\n\nThe packing of this is a tube with a twist off lid. It's pretty easy to use and made of mostly post-consumer material, which is cool. I have no complaints with the packaging other than wishing that the product was sold in a larger size (this won't last long). \n\nOne negative: the smell is sort of chemically/gross. It doesn't smell like sunscreen per say, but there's a sort of irony, weird smell to it when you first put it on. It does dissipate pretty quickly, but if you're scent-sensitive it's something to keep in mind. There's no fragrance in it at all.\n\nIn terms of sun protection: I'd rather see a higher SPF, but this performs adequately for me when I go for walks. I haven't had any burning or increases in hyper pigmentation or flares of my rosacea since I've been using it. \n\nI'd say this is a good option for anyone looking for a silicone-free zinc-oxide only mineral sunscreen. I think it would perform best for people with dry/normal skin. It seems to be protective, the texture is nice, and it doesn't leave a noticeable whitecast, greasiness, or chalkiness. It's not waterproof, but holds on during my walks if I get sweaty. Overall, I'm fairly impressed and likely will repurchase this!",

    "body": "Updated on 4/21/25. \n\nI have a little background: I went fragrance-free about ten years ago after dealing with about five years of some of the worst allergies of my life. This change made a huge difference in my health and overall well-being, but also caused me a lot of stress. I have 2c/3a hair that is medium to coarse, naturally frizzy, and dry. I also have seborrheic dermatitis, which gets triggered by many oils, and I have nut and avocado allergy, so I avoid anything with those oils (it might be ok due to oils not having protein, but I'm not going to risk it). \n\nIn the last 4-5 years, I have been able to occasionally use fragranced products again as long as I don't use them every day. I use K18 Mask once every couple of weeks, and I sometimes feel a little itchy with it, but it's tolerable. I handled Olaplex well too.\n\nGood fragrance-free curly hair products are far, and few, and it's better now than it used to be but still not as ideal as I would like. Here's what I am using now:\n\n**The Ordinary Shampoo:** I'm not super picky regarding shampoo. I want something that will clean my hair but not strip it. This does just that. However, it doesn't lather much, but I'm ok with that because lather comes more from lathering agents like betaine rather than sulfates and sulfate alternatives that break up oil and clean the hair. Plus, lathering agents can be irritants. I tried it as a body wash too, and it was fine, cleansing but not stripping.\n\n**The Ordinary Conditioner:** This is a great conditioner. There was so much slip, leaving my hair light and soft. I didn't have to use much either. The directions say to rinse it all out, but I leave a little in. For more conditioning, I  can mix a few drops of oil into it in my palm before applying. I would buy bigger bottles of this.\n\n**Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Fragrance and Protein Free Curl Cream:** I saw a review saying this is a dupe for SEEN Curl Cream, and I don't agree, but I still like it. SEEN is more of a leave-in with a little hold and NYM is more like a gel with some moisture. It gives a good definition and decent hold. It doesn't have cationic conditioning agents, so it doesn't have that clumping reaction with regular gels. I'm currently pairing it with Lulu Lube and Silver Stone Apothecary Gel.\n\n**Lulu Lubricant:** This product has a weird story. A hair YouTuber made a video of her using it to refresh her hair, which came out well. Then a bunch of people started reviewing it, saying it worked for their hair too. Lulu then stated that it's a good CG product as part of its marketing. I tried it because it's simple and cheap, and it's not the first time I've attempted to lube in my hair. It's similar to Curl Keeper or Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle but doesn't have plastic film formers. It has sodium PCA, is super moisturizing, has a lot of slip, and is a very light hold, and it doesn't react to creams or leave-ins with cationic conditioning agents. I've also noticed more shine in my hair when I use it. It's also the best thing I have found for refreshing curls. \n\n**Silver Stone Apothecary Mystic Styling Gel:** When used alone, it gives good clumps and definition, but it has such a strong hold that it makes my hair feel dry, especially if the weather is dry. It doesn't pair well with cationic conditioners unless my hair is very wet or diluted. I'm currently using a little bit mixed with Lulu lube to get more hold.\n\nThis is what else I have used that's still available:\n\n**SEEN Shampoo and Deeper Conditioner:** I really liked SEEN for a long time, but I have a bad ragweed allergy, and I'm nervous that constant exposure to bisabolol (a chamomile-derived compound) will eventually cause a reaction. If it weren't for that, I think these are great products. The shampoo cleans well while not being harsh, and the Deeper Conditioner moisturizes well, but it could have a better slip. If I add a little squalane to the conditioner, I can make a nice moisturizing deep treatment.\n\n**SEEN Curly Creme:** The closest thing to an HG styling product I have found in the last ten years that I can still use. It's fairly moisturizing and helps my hair form clumps when I brush style. However, it does not have enough hold on its own and I get more frizz than I'm comfortable with when it's used alone, so I have to use it with a gel and it doesn't play well with a lot of traditional hair gels.\n\n**Not Your Mother's Fragrance & Protein Free Gel:** It doesn't play well with cationic conditioning agents and alone makes my hair feel dry. It is probably compatible with the NYM Curl Talk Curl Cream, but I feel like that combo would be too much hold for me in my climate.\n\n**Curlsmith Shine Jelly:** I know this isn't truly fragrance-free, but I don't react. It helps my hair form amazing clumps, has a good hold that lasts, and doesn't react to the SEEN Curly cream. However, my hair started to feel a little dry with it. Still, it was better than a lot of things I've tried. I may go back to it again someday.\n\n**SEEN Leave-in Conditioner:** This is just the Curly cream without hold and more oil. It plays a little better with the Silver Stone gel than the curly cream, but the combo still wasn't moisturizing, so I returned it. \n\n**Curl Keeper Fragrance-Free:** Combined with the SEEN curly cream, it helped with frizz, shine and definition, and my hair looked great. Unfortunately, it contains DMDM Hydantoin, which made my scalp itch. \n\n**Devacurl Fragrance-Free Gel:** I hated how this felt in my hair. It reduced the slip while I was styling (I rake and brush my styling product into fully coat my hair), and then my hair felt dry after styling. It also had a bit of that balling-up reaction with the SEEN cream. I returned it.\n\n**Vanicream Shampoo and Conditioner:** The shampoo is harsh, and the conditioner doesn't condition my hair at all. \n\n**Vanicream Hair Gel:** Good hold, good clumping, and good frizz control, but it makes my hair feel dry\n\n**A Simple Planet Defined Hair Gel:** This was my HG styler for a couple of years, and then the last time I used it, I got this burning reaction from it. To this day, I still have no idea what caused it because I'm not allergic to anything in it from what I can tell (all the ingredients are in other things I use). My only guess was that it went bad and got very acidic when the preservative kicked in. I can't trust it to try again.\n\n**Curelle Hydra Shampoo and Riche Conditioner:** These were my HG products long before I discovered SEEN. The conditioner is very gentle and has a lot of slip. However, they both have oat protein, and I had to clarify a lot to prevent protein overload, but I would use these again. Even with the shipping from Canada, they were cost-effective. Also, the conditioner worked as a leave-in.\n\n**Curelle Hair Gel:** It made my hair look stringy and awful. Its high pH made me nervous about its health.\n\n**Curl Junkie Spiral Lotion:** Very moisturizing and helped with definition, but it broke me out around my ears and jawline. Also couldn't be used without a gel.\n\n** Jessicurl Spirialicious Gel: ** This one was weird. If I used it on soaking wet hair, my hair would get really limp, and my curls would fall out. It was way too much hold if I used it on damp hair. I decided it was too finicky and gave it away.\n\n**KY Liquid:** Lulu wasn't the first time I tried lube in my hair. I was attempting to dupe an old fragranced favorite, Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle. The KY was ok. It helped with moisture but had no hold so it couldn't be used independently. I may try it again with the SEEN Curly Cream someday.\n\n**Bulk Apocathary Hair Gel:** This hair gel base is meant for crafters and resellers to add their ingredients and fragrance and then repackage. It's very inexpensive. I found it was not moisturizing enough so I added 1 part glycerin to 4 parts gel and got a product similar to Curl Keeper and Curls in a Bottle. However, it didn't play well with my leave-in then, and it would leave my hair feeling dry after a day.\n\n**Flax Seed Gel: I wanted to add this because it's recommended a lot. My hair loved it, but my scalp hated it. It triggered my seborrheic dermatitis. Also, it's a huge hassle to make.",

Plus I garden and allergic to wasps.\n\nI have super curly frizzy dry hair too but it’s fine, thinning, and graying. (Gray’s very fine not stereotypically wiry.) Generally protein has been my friend.\n\nI use Neutrogena T-Sal shampoo but it’s too drying to use every day in summer when I need to get the pollen out of my hair. Looking for an uber gentle shampoo or co-wash that would remove pollen but not weigh my fine hair down. Any leads?\n\nI’ve been using the ff Ouidad Unbreakable Bonds condition and sometimes the shampoo. It isn’t really moisturizing enough but doesn’t weigh my hair down.\nI’ve tried the ff Curl Keeper but doesn’t seem to work as well as it used to - not sure why??\nHave been using the Treluxe ff serum. It was ok over winter/spring but isn’t cutting in humid summer weather.\nHave used Mixed Chicks Kids Leave-In off and on — which doesn’t weigh my hair down and has a bit of hold - tho not eanoygh. Not enough conditioning.\n\nI have yet to find anything ff to gets rid of my frizz but doesn’t weigh down my hair. Oils never work - just give me shiny frizz. Nor anything that effective clumps and holds my hair. I recently tried Color Wow’s Dream Coat for Curly Hair - but it doesn’t last past day 1…\n\nI also can’t find anything to replace my holy grail root product — Nioxin Diamax Advanced. \n\nAny suggestions?\n\n(I used to use Curls Rock activator - almost a 1 and done product for me. Or Curl Keeper/AG Recoil/Batia & Aleeza Hair Gel/Glaze - alternatively Phyto Defrisant Balm instead of Curl Keeper. Or Nick Chavez Plump n Thick Leave-In or HydroHair Styling Mask. But never found anything to put over these for hold.)",

    "body": "Okay so I know this isn't a relatively new concept, Aquaphor/Vaseline  as your last step heavy duty moisturizer has been mentioned in this sub before, more so in older posts - but oh my god, guys.\n\nI bought Aquaphor quite a while ago but I have been massively too stubborn to want to slap on a layer of this before going to bed because I was worried about it getting in my hair, pillow cases, finding it too thick and uncomfortable, etc. Plus it's been unbearably hot in SoCal until recently but now that fall has caught on here, I tried this last night. \n\n**A little background:**\n\nI own CeraVe in the tub, I've tried and used Vanicream for years when I was younger, and I have to say - the only thing that compares to the results I've gotten is either slathering multiple (like 4) layers of Vanicream (which takes a long ass time to rub in I'll tell you that much) or sleeping in a thick as duck, sticky, vitamin e oil.\n\n**Aquaphor vs Vaseline:**\n\nI picked Aquaphor instead of Vaseline because it contained added beneficial ingredients such as: \n\n* Lanolin\n\n* Bisabolol\n\n* Panthenol \n\n* Glycerin\n\nLanolin is a 2 on cosdna for comedogenic tendencies, so patch test first.   \n\n**Results:**\nMy PIE looked FAR less red and irritated, my skin is smooth and moisturized than it has been in a very long time, not a hint of any dry patches in sight. No peelies either! Bonus results if you skin is still slightly wet. Seriously, the reduction in the appearance of my PIE is what amazed me the most.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDo not underestimate the importance of an occlusive. All hail the slug life.",

Combo skin, which for me is normal cheeks and an oily T-zone. I'm early 30s, but am still acne prone. So, that's wonderful. And my eyes are incredibly sensitive. Even popular Koreans spfs tingle my eyeballs.\n\n**Heliocare 360 Sensation**\n\nFilters: nano and non-nano zinc and titanium, Uvinul A Plus, octisalate, Tinosorb S\n\nSkincare: Bisabolol, panthenol, ginger root, Fernblock\n\nPros:\n- No pilling \n- No eye sting\n- Sheer\n- Water/sweat resistant \nCons:\n- citrus peel and other fragrance \n\nThis sunscreen is the popular fluid consistency. It's a sheer, non-greasy hybrid that leaves minimal white cast on me Fitzpatrick I and my husband who is Fitzpatrick III. I will be repurchasing, as the texture is amazing and doesn't hurt my eyes.\n\n**Heliocare Pigment Solution Fluid**\n\nFilters: nano zinc and titanium, octisalate, Tinosorb A2B, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150\n\nSkincare: Urea, Plankton, vitamin C, Pullulan, Fernblock, niacinamide \n\nPros:\n- No pilling\n- no eye sting\n- water/sweat resistant \n- evens out skin tone \nCons:\n- Smells weird\n- not dark skin friendly \n- fragrance \n\nThis is a very lightly tinted liquid that is slightly moisturizing but dries down semi-matte. The tint is very sheer and offers skin perfecting qualities, but I have doubts about the tint working for anyone beyond a Fitzpatrick III. This is my HG sunscreen and I'll always repurchase.\n\n**Heliocare 360 Water Gel**\n\nFilters: Octocrylene, octisalate, Avobenzone, ensulizole, Uvinul A Plus, Tinosorb A2B, Uvinul T150\n\nSkincare: Arginine, Urea, Serine, Pullulan, Fernblock \n\nPros:\n- Matte!\n- no pilling \n- sheer\n- Water/sweat resistant \nCons:\n- Eye sting\n- Fragrance \n- Possibly too matte\n\nThis one made me sad, because I was loving everything Heliocare so far! But it burned my eyeballs and dried out my cheeks. My oily T-zone looked nice, though. Would be best suited for very oily skin and someone without eye sensitivity. It does have claims that it's good for sensitive eyes, and I wish that were true for me.\n\n**Heliocare 360 Gel Oil-Free Non tinted**\n\nFilters: Ensulizole, Bisdisulizole, Tinosorb S, nano titanium, Uvinul A Plus, Uvinul T150\n\nSkincare: Arginine, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, melanin, vitamin C, green tea extract, Fernblock, Vitamin B derivative, Plankton \n\nPros:\n- matte\n- doesn't pill (mostly)\n- No eye sting\nCons:\n- Fragrance \n\nI used the untinted version, but the melanin inclusion does lightly tinted the gel. The color leans warm, but is fairly sheer. Comfortably matte. This does feel like you have a film on your face, but once my face produced oil it turned into a comfortable second skin. It made me look both luminous and matte while evening my skin tone. They make 2 darker shades as well.\n\nThis doesn't pill for me unless I overwork it on my face. The gel dries fast, so I recommend applying it in sections. Did not pill upon reapplication.\n\nI'll be repurchasing this one for hiking especially, due to the amount of antioxidants packed in here.",

        "body": "It's nice to see someone talking about Heliocare. I agree that both Sensation and Pigment Solution are awesome. I've never tried Water Gel though. \n\nIt always comes to my attention when people say Gel Oil Free is matte, for me, that was only the case when I applied little amounts. When I applied the correct amount (¼ tsp), it would always leave my skin looking weird. Not matte, definitely. I looked shiny but not in a greasy or glowy way. Or in any nice way, by that matter. I looked like I put make-up on and I got too excited with the highlighter. Some people thought I had put glitter on my eye rings and cheeks area. Does this happen to anyone else with Gel Oil Free untinted? \n\nAlso I wouldn't recommend to go hiking with Gel Oil Free, it's basically one of the few sunscreens from Heliocare that isn't water nor sweat resistant. Pigment Solution also has a ton of antioxidants. \n\nIn case someone wanted to know the exact protection values for Heliocare Sensation and Pigment Solution, here you go:\n\nSPF 65\nUVAPF 23\n\nThat's for both of them.\n\nEdit: Typo",

(This is not at all sponsored, I paid for my whole shipment, I just wanted to help others out who want to hear about it.)\n\nIt's a mineral sunscreen with 9.4% zinc oxide, unscented, and labeled as \"grease-free and no-clog\". Although I know some people were disappointed that it's not a chemical formula, it was exciting for me to see because my skin is sensitive and reacts to most chemical filters.\n\nThe formula is super lightweight, and rubs in completely clear. I have white but slightly tanned skin, and there is no white cast on my skin at all. (Although I can't vouch for how it would look on darker skin tones.) Personally I've never tried a mineral sunscreen that hasn't left at least a slight white cast on my skin - this one doesn't.\n\nThe formula is originally a bit tacky, but dries down comfortably matte after 1-2 minutes. It's not drying, nor greasy. I can't yet vouch for how well it protects my skin, or if my skin will break out from it, but it's the most comfortable mineral based sunscreen I've tried.\n\nIt's $14 for 1.4 oz, and here are the inactive ingredients: Water, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycerin, Squalane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) Extract, Polyester-5, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Ethyl Ferulate, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Bisabolol, Sodium Chloride, Phospholipids, Gluconolactone, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Urea, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nedit: I will say that the pump on the packaging is wonky, only really works at a very specific angle, which is a bit annoying. Although another bonus I forgot to mention, is that I can apply it close to my eyes without any irritation or stinging. ",

    "body": "Hello from Germany. I have been using the Balea MED Intensivcreme Urea (7%) Ultra Sensitive for a while now. I use tretinoin 0.1% every day and Germany is dryyyy, and while I have been enjoying the Balea MED Urea cream, I don't feel that it's moisturising enough. At night I still have to put a layer of Nivea creme in the blue tin. The problem is that it leaves a film on my face and since I'm not a day face washer, it makes it easier for sunscreen to pill. Wiping my face with some water helps, but still. I finally got the chance to try out the Altruist Urea 10%. Their sunscreen (Altruist SPF50) has been my HG in the winter, and is still the most moisturising sunscreen I have ever used. \n\nThe price is pretty reasonable, 6 EUR for 200ml, cheaper than the Balea Med which is 4,15 EUR for 50ml. The ingredients are pretty basic, notable ingredients  include urea, glycerin and bisabolol. It has no fragrance, sinks it quickly and does not leave a greasy sticky film on your face like the Nivea creme. I would say that the texture reminds me a bit of the Cerave moisturising cream. It does not feel heavy duty, but the magical bit is that I wake up the next morning with perfectly moisturised face, with no dry flakes and no greasy film. I can still feel a slight film on my face, but it's not greasy. My face basically doesn't feel all dried out and tight. It's actually the only thing (beside the Nivea in the blue tin) that manages to keep my face from drying out in the morning.   \n\nAll in all, I absolutely love it. I tried the Eucerin 5% urea in the past and it was just not moisturising enough for me. The only thing is that Urea 10% might have a slight exfoliating effect, so proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin. For some reasons I can handle it pretty well, despite using tretinoin 0.1% every day.",

Because I don’t wear makeup, I don’t use it on my face, unless doing sports, due to the smallest white cast (really have to look). I suspect that very slight cast also gives extra protection, so it’s a trade-off.  I find most UK sunscreens too heavy because they’re designed to be water resistant, summer-only vs matte for face everyday and reapply. \n\nThe 10% urea moisturiser is very good and doesn’t smell like others I’ve used with urea.\n\nAlso like the charity aspect of Altruist (and NOT associated in any way)",

    "body": "Hey everyone! I received my first **Play by Sephora** bag last month and decided to review each product as I run through it. I'm adding each product individually into my routine, so I can see individual benefits/effects (if any!).\n\nThis is my first time doing a review like this, and I'm planning on submitting a big giant review of a bunch of my empties of products I've been using the last year. **So if you have any suggestions for future reviews, please let me know! CCW**\n\n**Intro to my skin**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging, trying to reduce the use of fragrances\n\n**Product Review**\n\n***Product:*** Biossance Squalane + Probiotic Gel Moisturizer\n\n***Product Type:*** Light-weight moisturizer (which I was excited about!)\n\n***Cost:*** **$$$** - ~32.5 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Squalane, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Dimethiconol, Chrondrus Crispus Extract, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Linoleic Acid, Phospholipids, Sodium Phytate, Lechithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid, Lepidium Sativum Sprout Extract, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract.\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Great light-weight moisturizer**; **Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Fatty alcohol-free**; Contains fatty acids; thin consistency; no noticeable smell; absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** This sample lasted me approximately 1 week of PM only use\n\n***My experience:*** I liked this product! I'm very prone to CCs from even light-weight moisturizers, and this one did not break me out or cause any noticeable blemishes. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, and does leave my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I like the idea that the squalane is the main moisturizing ingredient in this product - squalane always sits well on my skin. Plus, I liked that I didn't have to do an additional squalane product mixed into the moisturizer since the squalane is already \"built in\" to the moisturizer, therefore reducing the number of products I'm using at night.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This stuff claims to \"Calm the look of skin redness\" and \"Reduce the appearance of pore size\". Neither of these claims I found to be true. In fact, I found that it actually increased redness around my nostrils, which normally gets a little dry for me. When I applied this product, I would feel a slight stinging around my nostrils, followed by redness. This didn't last, so it was likely from something irritating my skin. But I did not find my natural redness being reduced after 1 week. And no - it did not reduce the appearance of pores. Granted, these lackluster results could be due to the size of the sample - not being able to use the product longer than one week. Also can't make any claims toward the \"probiotic\" effects of this product - it feels a little gimmick-y to me. [Change my mind](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/344/294/fe2.jpg).\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 stars, mainly due to lackluster results. WNRP due to cost - I'd rather stick to my affordable moisturizer + affordable squalane.\n\n[Pictures!](https://imgur.com/a/xpYpZma)\n\n1. Empty-ish container\n2. Consistency\n3. Bottle + bonus kitten for scale (*Her name is Buffy. She's real cute*)",

I have tested it as a sole sunscreen as well as a re-application sunscreen and it holds up in both, however my skin was more matte when it was my sole sunscreen. More- not completely. It isn’t magic and it doesn’t completely get rid of all my sweat and sebum like blotting paper but I didn’t expect magic either. It significantly decreases the greasy/oily appearance of skin and works fine with sweat as well. As for over make-up there was some transfer onto the stick but I just applied it to my arms to get rid of that. An alcohol wipe would likely work just as well.\n\nHonestly, I would likely repurchase this as most sunscreen really exacerbate how oily I can look especially in a humid environment that makes you really sweat in summer and this helped me look and feel more put-together. Also- I didn’t get any skin irritation or breakouts and despite the long list of ingredients they are not pore clogging. Pretty much a 10/10 for me!",

Found an HG in an Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer that got discontinued a bit later and [I went a little bit nuts stocking up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3azdfm/this_is_what_happens_when_half_your_skincare/)   \n\nOnce my stash ran out, I had to start searching for a new go-to moisturizer. I tried a Garnier gel and it was just *okay* (nice but like 1/10^th the moisture I needed), then tried a Garnier anti-oxidant bomb and it was also just okay (kinda burned, didn't actually have SPF but was greasy and shiny like it sure did). Made [this post looking for recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/71u80s/routine_help_canadians_andor_americans_very_very/), proceeded to not listen to any of them and tried out a [L'Oreal Hydra Genius](https://i.imgur.com/7fvTs5H.jpg) mostly because the glass bottle looked great and the ingredients seemed alright?\n Holy shit, the Hydra Genius made my skin freak out - for the few weeks I used it, it burned every time I put it on and I broke out in a load of cystic acne.\n\nSo as I wandered around the Real Canadian Superstore feeling pretty garbage, I actually spotted one of the recs from the rec post. The [Gold Bond Eczema Relief Cream with 2% colloidal oatmeal](http://www.goldbond.ca/en/products/eczema-relief-skin-proctectant-cream#tab=TabIngredients) that /u/nolancamp2 recommended. Putting Gold Bond on my face seemed a little sketch, but damn - the ingredients list looked *fiiiine*. It has a boatload of the moisturizers I like, vitamins, aloe, shea, whatever. And a giant tube of the cream was $8.\n\nGuys. GUYS. I've been using this for months now and the first application literally calmed redness leftover from the Hydra (Evil) Genius. It dries more matte than most of the moisturizers I've used. I have had zero issues with tight skin, dry patches, whatever - even as I've been testing other skincare products and adding in harsher treatments. The cream itself is a pale beige, thick with a very slight silicone feel but nothing slick or primer-like about it (I'm not a huge fan of moisturizers that are heavy with silicones, glycerin has long been my fave but I do appreciate that silicones do alright as a barrier). \n\nMy cysts have all healed up, my skin is looking glowier, and anytime I do something stupid (overexfoliate, try out a new product that makes me red, scrub my face too much, whatever) this $8 *Gold Bond* cream has saved me. (Note: I used CeraVe Cream for ages and while it moisturized beautifully sometimes it seemed to irritate my skin - I feel like the Gold Bond Cream is on par for moisture level but for me it's calming instead of irritating)\n\nI've been adding a couple products from The Ordinary into my routine that are notorious for pilling - with this moisturizer I found that rubbing may cause pilling but patting it in has resulted in zero pilling, even when I've layered several products on pretty thick. \n\n**Note:** ingredients are likely not up everyone's alleys, but if you're struggling to find an all-purpose moisturizer and don't necessarily have allergies or issues that you know of, give this a try.\n\n**Full ingredients list:** water, glycerin, dimethicone, petrolatum, propanediol, hydroxyehtyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, jojoba esters, cetyl alcohol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, glyceryl stearate, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter extract, isohexadecane, avena sativa (oat) kernel extract, bisabolol, zingiber officinale (ginger) root extract, C10-30 cholesterol/lanosterol esters, ceramide 2, hydrolyzed jojoba esters, tocopheryl acetate, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, panthenol, ethylhexylglycerin, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, tribehenin, dipotassium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, PEG-10 rapeseed sterol, methylparaben, polysorbate 60, palmitoyl oligopeptide",

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I’d put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

That’s why people go nuts trying to figure out a routine, because you literally have to mix and match every product and hope they work together to ensure you’re getting results. And then if you have a reaction, or could easily cut one out because it’s not doing shit... you don’t even know which one it is because you’ve at that point— created a cocktail of Deciem. It is quite the marketing strategy. It seems simplified but in theory it convolutes the skincare process immensely. Seeing the forest through the trees is hard, sometimes.",

YUM!!\n\nFlavour: it's a bit of a flavour bomb at first with a whole heap of terps hitting and waking up the flavour senses... beautiful kushy/earthy flavours linger after the flavour explosion subsides. Very very pleasant in both glassware and In a vape!!\n\nEffects: This has very quickly become in my top three available to me at the moment... Super clear headed, zero anxiety but that alpha-bisabolol is really shining through making this for me anyhow a flower that would be very hard to have a bad time on. Extremely clear headed but super body effects that rival pretty much anything I can think of as far as euphoria and body effects go... By no means a flower that will stop you getting anything done but also fantastic if you don't have much to do.\n\nOverall: Like most flowers from SatiVite they are a little dry for my liking, but still before rehydrating the buds had a nice snap but we're still kind of sticky when chopped up... 3 days later was all it took for this tub to turn from very dry to starting to get some moisture back in her. Also another thing I always use Integra over Boveda I just prefer the results I get. \nBut overall the only downside I have to this flower is it only comes in 7gram tubs otherwise this is my top 3 flower on the market imo 💚",

Appreciate your thoughts on flower.\n\nIt does sound nice and helpful.\n\n\nI've had mixed results with boveda and am leaning more towards integra boost aswell.\nFeels like the boveda takes out some of the flavour and at times the moisture is reduced compared to integra.\nWith integra boost seems that vape produces more vapor compared to boveda.\nThis has been my experiences.

    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nI figured there might be some people interested in this as well. I've been enjoying the BHA liquid exfoliant from Paula's Choice which is a bestseller and loved by many on this sub. I noticed they have different formulations of BHA and I've recently gained more interest in antioxidants in skincare. So I compiled a list of all their BHA's to figure out what the difference is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR :All their exfoliants are nearly the same price, however some of their products contain more ingredients that might be a good addition to your skincare regime, specifically antioxidants and hydrators/skin soothers. HOWEVER, a lot of people who use BHA like to have a product that is not heavy and doesn't add to their oil production. In that case, not all of their products might be suitable for your skin type, even though they contain added antioxidants. \n\nNote: I have not tested any of these products apart of the liquid exfoliant so I can't comment on the consistency but I can make an estimation based on the ingredients.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**Only contains green tea as an antioxidant and only two hydrators: methylpropanediol and butylene glycol. This consistency is probably the lightest.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant**Contains grape fruit extract, green tea and willow herb as antioxidants and only the 2 same hydrators as the liquid. Has added bisabolol (derived from camomile) which is skin soothing. Has a gel texture so might still be suitable for those who want a light consistency like the liquid but added antioxidants.\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Lotion Exfoliant**Contains green tea, licorice root extract, oat bran extract and willow herb as antioxidants. Also only contains the two hydrators mentioned above and has added allantoin which is skin soothing and repairing, so is the oat extract. Might be a little heavier than the two above.\n\n**Resist Anti-Aging 2% BHA Exfoliant**Has many added hydrators so might be best suit for dryer skin types which don't tolerate BHA as well. Has nordihydroguaiaretic acid added as the only antioxidant.\n\n**Clear Extra Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Again only contains the two hydrators mentioned in the description of the liquid. Only contains green tea as an antioxidant so doesn't seem much different to the liquid to me.\n\n**Clear Regular Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**Contains many added hydrators and no antioxidants. So my bet would be if you're looking for a more moisturizing BHA go for the resist anti age. This one is a little bit cheaper tho...\n\n**Calm 1% BHA Exfoliant**Lower percentage of BHA and many added hydrators. Contains green tea, licorice root extract, oat bran extract, and willow herb as antioxidants. Also contains allantoin. If you're not sensitive I would choose the lotion mentioned above over this one as it has a similar ingredient list but higher percentage of the active ingredient.\n\nMore detailed summary of the products:\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin calming/antioxidant)\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Bisabolol (skin-soothing)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Fruit Extract (antioxidant)\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (antioxidant)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (skin-soothing)\n\n**Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Lotion Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (antioxidant)\n* Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n* Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (plant-based antioxidant soothing agent)\n\n**Resist Anti-Aging 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €38\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Dipropylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Pentylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 (skin-restoring)\n* Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (skin-restoring)\n* Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing)\n* Oleanolic Acid (skin-soothing)\n* etanorulayH muidoS (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing), Trehalose (hydration/skin replenishing), Panthenol (skin-conditioning agent)\n* Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration/texture-enhancing)\n* Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration/texture-enhancing)\n* Glycereth-26 (emollient texture-enhancing)\n* Caprylyl Glycol (skin-conditioning agent)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Nordihydroguaiaretic Acid (antioxidant)\n\n**Clear Extra Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €36\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Methylpropanediol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Oleifera (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin-soothing/antioxidant)\n\n**Clear Regular Strength 2% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nPrice: €34\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 2% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Dipropylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Pentylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Glycerin (skin replenishing)\n* etanorulayH muidoS (hydration/skin replenishing)\n* Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n* Panthenol (hydration)\n* Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration)\n* Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* None\n\n**Calm 1% BHA Exfoliant**\n\nActive ingredient\n\n* 1% salicylic acid\n\nHydrators\n\n* Butylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration)\n* Dimethicone (hydration)\n* Allantoin (skin-soothing)\n* Lauric Acid (skin-replenishing)\n* Glycerin (skin-replenishing)\n* Hexylene Glycol (hydration)\n* Ethylhexylglycerin (skin-conditioning agent)\n\nAntioxidants\n\n* Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract (skin-soothing/antioxidant)\n* Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing)\n* Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract (skin-soothing)\n* Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (skin-soothing)",

I put off trying it for a while as I thought it had GSC/cake genetics, but it is in fact a mango strain in disguise! It is a cross between Chronic, White Widow, and Exodus Cheese. A full family tree can be found here: https://en.seedfinder.eu/strain-info/Strawberry_Cheesecake/Heavyweight_Seeds/\n\nCountry of origin: Canada\n\nGrowing conditions: Unknown\n\nIrradiation: Gamma?\n\nLook: Dry, brittle. Well-trimmed. Medium/pale green + yellow. Round nugs. Very similar to Ultra01. Moderate trichome coverage. \n\nTerpenes: 2.44% total (doubtful, maybe once upon a time? didn't seem fresh at all). Terpinolene dominant at 0.86% (!). Rare to see in an \"Indica\". Next up is Myrcene and ocimene around 0.4%. Smaller amounts of Limonene, terpineol, bisabolol, pinene, caryophyllene and terpinene. Great spread.\n\nSmell: Mango mode. Somewhat subdued smell. Fruity & herbaceous aroma, dominantly unripe mango, lime, and mint, with some funk underneath. Slight artificial strawberry aroma. I wouldn't think to have called this strawberry over mango. Again, quite similar to Ultra01 though less acrid.\n\nEffect: Finally, a sedating strain that agrees with me. This will never fail to put a smile on my face above 188c (dat terpinolene). Highly uplifting yet also relaxing (actually relaxing, so rare for me!). Quite mental, but not in an anxious way. Great for my depression and makes me feel normal and stable emotionally. Feels like nighttime Ultra01. An Indica strain for Sativa lovers. Does not suppress my appetite. As much as I love the effect, it could be so much richer with more character if it had more terps. Please Medcan, work on improving the freshness on this one. Legendary strain.\n\nBatch #: MCA-AGM-SC01-B9\n\nSimilar strains: Ultra01, Woomera\n\nRATING:\n\nLook: 6/10\n\nSmell: 6/10\n\nEffect: 8/10\n\nTOTAL: 6.8/10",

It is made by cross border concentrates and the strain is strawberry drops, it claims to have over 10% terpenes and after just smelling the product I can tell that it’s not far fetched. It’s a cross between Bruce banner and SFV OG a 60% indica to 40% sativa. I’ve tried the live rosin concentrates like FTP, ZBC and the Rilaxe ones but this one is the best so far. It costs $175 for 5g packaging, only available from two pharmacies in QLD. Very nice earthy and gassy aroma combined with citrus. \nProminent terpenes include Limonene, β-Caryophyllene, Germacene B, Myrcene and α-Bisabolol.\nThis product comes really close to the Indian hashish I guess temple balls are the western version of Indian hashish. I would recommend this product to all novice and experienced users alike. If u are new just take it slow. U can smoke it in a joint after mixing with the flower or if u have a hash kettle u can vape it on its own. I wouldn’t recommend using it in an erig as it may leave some residue behind, if that is not a concern go ahead and give it a go in an erig and let me know how it works for you. \nIf anyone has tried this strain before do share your experience on this post. \n\n\nTotal Terpenes 10.08%",

    "body": "[Zeroid ](https://imgur.com/a/rdBPQJH)\n\n(Obviously not sponsored)\n\nI’ve been using these products for a month and here is my review. \n\nPurchased: I purchased these two moisturizers from atopalm.com. Since atopalm.com website is based in New Jersey, United States, the order arrived quickly. Both are 80 ml and have no scent. \n\nSkin type: Combination (oily dehydrated acne prone)\n\nProblem: Restoring skin barrier and inflammation \n\n1. Intensive Oint-Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\nReview: I apply this nighttime after I put on the soothing cream for more hydration. This melts into the skin right away and surprisingly doesn’t make my face look oily. I really like this moisturizer and I started using it in May (when the month started off with cool weather). It feels so light on my skin and I’m going to repurchase it after it’s finished. With this moisturizer, the hydration lasts the whole day. It doesn’t break me out either and doesn’t leave a white cast. In the winter time, I’ll probably use this during the daytime too. \n\n2. Soothing Cream\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua, Glycerin, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Sorbitan stearate, Cetearyl alcohol, Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower) seed oil, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Bisabolol, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl glycol, Tropolone\n\nReview: I use this daytime and nighttime. It’s a great simple moisturizer and this also doesn’t make my face look oily. It doesn’t break out my skin. This moisturizer also goes into my skin right away and does not leave a white cast. I will also be repurchasing this moisturizer too. \n\nResult: Both of these moisturizers really have helped restore my skin barrier and my skin feels stronger. My skin also has been less inflamed.",

Each is designed to benefit a particular skin type.The two most recent bases are known as Nai, a luxury base, and Fortis, a budget friendly base. Grooming Dept provides this link on their site to explore each base type - Grooming Dept (https://www.groomingdept.com/). Mohammad is the owner/operator and is an absolute soap genius. He uses unique and innovative ingredients to arrive at luxurious lather qualities. In addition to purchasing direct from Grooming Dept, they can also be purchased from West Coast Shaving (https://www.westcoastshaving.com/) and Italian Barber (https://www.italianbarber.com/). Aion will arrive this week to West Coast Shaving for those looking to buy soon.  \n\nAion is a light woody scent. While no scent notes are listed by Grooming Dept, I am smelling cedar and vetiver for sure. There may be some oakmoss hiding out in there as well. The fragrance is masculine and approachable for a woody scent. Based on the notes immediately forward on this fragrance, Mrs. Ruds does not approve. You probably recall, woody scents are not really her jam unless they are complemented with other notes. Strength of scent is light, by design, both off the tub and once lathered. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Eleven Cedar, Vetiver & Sweetgrass as a similar scent profile.\n\nAion is offered in the Nai base. This base intends to focus on high grade cosmetic ingredients. The listed ingredients are: Aloe Vera Juice, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Cupuacu Butter, Mango Butter, Camelina Oil, Fragrance, Marshmallow Extract, Glycerine, Cera Alba, Sunflower Lecithin, Jojoba Oil, Avocado Oil, Coconut Oil, Larch Arabinogalactan, Tara Gum, Erythritol, Glucomannan (Konjac root), Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Silk Peptides, Propanediol, Beta Sitosterol, Hydrolyzed Whey Protein, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Citrate, Sodium hydroxide, Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Betaine, Sasha Inchi Oil, Meadofoam Oil, Allantoin, Argan Oil, Shea Olein, Oleic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Colloidal Oatmeal, Sucrose Cocoate, Sodium Gluconate, Calendula Extract, Ceramide 3, Liquorice Root Extract, Beta Glucan, Broccoli Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Hyaluronic Acid, Grape Seed Extract, Chamomile Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Green Tea Extract, Alpha Bisabolol, Inositol, Histidine, Lysine, Arginine, Sodium PCA, Sodium Alginate, Aspen Bark Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf extract, Phospholipids, Resveratrol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E). The soap base is on the firmer side of the spectrum and loads mindlessly easy into any brush fiber. The base is thirsty, but not extremely thirsty. When dialed in, the resulting lather is similar to creme fraiche. Primary and residual slickness are elite. The razor glides along unimpeded and with no drag. Post shave is where this base shines though, the post shave is elite and among the most luxurious and nourishing that I’ve come across. To say I am impressed with this base would not do it justice. Given the amazing experience and metrics, Grooming Dept Nai receives a ShaveScore of 100. For similar performance in a base, I suggest Wholly Kaw Siero.     \n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Grooming Dept Aion (loaner)\n* Brush - Turn-N-Shave “Piano” (purchased)\n* Razor - RazoRock Lupo SS (purchased)\n* Post - Geo F.

Personally, I’m not worried about mine and probably wouldn’t hesitate to buy new tubs if wanted some. \n\nI’m not blaming users, but I wonder if there is something unstable that is being triggered by how some people use them? Obviously, that kind of thing shouldn’t happen. But I’ve had no issues with mold and I’ve owned lots of GD soaps. It makes me wonder if I can “force” it to happen with a different brand of soap. \n\nAnyhow, I have a tub of Aion. Even though I’m not sure shave scores are quantifiable, I do think the GD Nai base performs at least as well as the other 100 point soaps, and possibly better than all of them except for WK Siero.

Essentially, I used this cream for a few weeks, and got heavenly skin (and lots of compliments!) — even tone, smoother texture, and noticeably smaller-looking pores. But, my skin also lightened a bit — not unnaturally light, around the same skin tone as the rest of my body that's not hyper-pigmented. Because of this lightning, I stopped, fearing that the cream has bleaching products that are not listed.\n\nI tried contacting the company about this but received no response. I also tried researching all of the ingredients, and none of them seem to be bleaching or really harmful. As well, the company is based in Montreal, so must comply with Canadian laws about the accuracy of pre-packaged items. And, I've had some friends use it for about 7 years, and their skin still looks great. These are the ingredients:\n\n**INGREDIENTS:** Aqua, Fragrance (Parfum), Disodium EDTA, Panthenol, Allantoin, Inositol, Calcium Pantothenate, Alcohol Denat., Equisetum Arvense Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Tussilago Farfara (Coltsfoot) Leaf Extract, Lactic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycolipids, Sodium Hyaluronate, Viola Tricolor Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Rosa Moschata Seed Oil, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Bisabolol, Hexylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 60, Isohexadecane, Sodium Acrylate/Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer, Soluble Collagen, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tridecyl Stearate, Tridecyl Trimellitate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Mineral Oil, Glycerin\n\nSo, are any of the ingredients bleaching or unsafe to use long-term? Is there any lab that I can send a sample to (and pay, of course) to get an independent analysis of the ingredients?\n\nEDIT: Removed the link since people think it's an ad, the ingredient list itself should get me answers to my questions",

I don't know how much this Essence de Beaute cream costs where you live, but surely you can find something better for the same price. \n\nLactic acid is doing the skin lightening here, via exfoliation. Rosehip oil might lend a hand, too. But they're both drowned out in a sea of crap. Other than that, panthenol and allantoin are soothing, shea butter is an emollient (as again is the rosehip oil), and oat extract is soothing+moisturizing.\n\nOverall, this is a really, really bad formula. If your skin has reacted well to it, chances are it will react well to anything with Lactic acid in it. There are no dangerous bleaching ingredients in it, and with the money it would cost to have it tested (Canada does have regulations, you know), you'd be far better off finding a decent moisturizer or serum with Lactic acid high on the list.\n\nAnd please wear sunscreen.

Disodium EDTA is a preservative, to keep the product from going bad.  In Canada, it's supposed to be around 0.1% used in products but with it listed so high, I'm wondering how much is really in there.\n\nPanthenol is basically B-5 which is used for moisturizing and healing.   Allantoin reduces irritation and sensitivity.  It is very common in many skin products, especially for those aimed at sensitive skin.  Inositol is a moisturizer/humectant.  Another very common product, since it helps cling onto water and keep it in your skin barrier.   Calcium Pantothenate is basically B-5 again, in a crystalline form.  Alcohol Denat. is alcohol and it is 8th on your ingredients list.  It means there is a fair amount in the cream.  Now, alcohol in cream is not necessarily bad, since there are some good benefits from it, however if they have it too high on the list, it has the possibility of drying out the skin.\n\nOverall, I would never go near a cream like this, especially with the fragrance so high on the list.  My first question, when I see this, is what are they hiding?  How chemical scented is this product, without all of that fragrance?  Honestly, it's a red flag.\n\nI do recommend researching the ingredients before buying a skin care or body product.  I use [INCIDecoder](https://incidecoder.com/), which is a site for looking up ingredients, to see what each item is and how it works.",

    "body": "My skin type: dry/normal acne prone skin\n\nCurrent climate conditions: hot and humid \n\nAge : 22f\n\nCorsx advanced snail mucin essence :\n\nIt's a lightweight hydrating serum, it has a slimy texture and absorbs quickly into the skin. I bought it due to the hype on the sub. Honestly I feel it's overrated, it's just a hydrating serum. It did what it was supposed to do. \nMight repurchase, but I want to try other brands first. \n\nMinimalist ceramide + Bisabolol moisturiser :\n\nI liked it! It's very lightweight and absorbs into the skin well, plus the ingredients are good. I used it as a night time moisturiser. But the bottle is so small (just 50ml) and it gets over very soon. I finished it in 3 weeks. Plus it's expensive, I bought it cos I could get it on sale at 35% off from firstcry. \nWon't repurchase, I prefer to use buy a bigger bottle ( 100ml minimum) of moisturiser . WRNP.\n\nMinimalist vitamin B5 moisturiser :\n\nThe ingredients of this looked very promising, hence I bought it. It has a gel like texture and it's milky grey in colour. I always apply moisturisers on damp skin and it applied smoothly, but there was this stickiness on the skin even after the moisturiser dried out. This shows that formulation is really important, just because the ingredients are perfect, that doesn't mean the cream will be perfect.  This bottle also is just 50ml, minimalist just give us more quantity! I don't want to buy a new moisturiser every 3 weeks. 🙅 There are better options in the market like emolene. WNRP.\n\nSnp prep serum :\n\nI love this! It hydrates the skin so well!! And plus the bottle is so big (220ml) and quite inexpensive if you buy it during sale, I bought it for rs 525 from foxy.\n It has that serumy texture and it's light pinkish in colour. I apply it on damp skin and follow up with a moisturiser after waiting for 10 secs. Its lovely!  My skin is soft and hydrated .\n\nAlso, the first ingredient in this is glycerin which has a small molecule so it penetrates deeper into the skin and plumps it up. \n\nThis product is underrated on this sub. Will repurchase definitely! HG 💕 \n\nOne thing centalla toner :\n\nIt has a very watery texture and it gets over quickly. I have been using it daily twice in a day for 3 weeks and it's almost half way over. I bought it because of the antioxidant benefits and that it protects from sun damage. Hopefully it's doing that 🥲. \n\nI use this before applying sebogel/glyco 6 at night and this has helped reduce irritation. My skin tolerates actives better now. Apart from that I don't see any tangible benefit, but I'll continue using it believing that it actually does something 😅\n\nMight repurchase, but I want to try the other One Thing toners before that. \n\nMoiz LMF 48 lotion :\n\nAgain this had really good ingredients - like aloe vera, sodium hyaluronate , squalène which tempted me to buy it. It had this smooth runny texture to it. I used it as a daytime moisturiser and I felt it was too much . It made my face oily.  Maybe I applied too much, I don't know 🙆 anyway, it's suitable for the winters and a more dryer climate. \nMight repurchase if I run out of options. \n\nNipcare cream :\n\nIt's a pure lanolin cream. I have been using this as a lipbalm after watching Dr Sheerene Idris's video about lip basting. She talks about the benefits of using pure lanolin, as it has the capability to hold in moisture.\n\n It's sticky and has a medical smell, but since I use it at night I'm not bothered. It works better than Vaseline. My lips look plump the next morning and the cream stays on my lips till the morning. \n\n I layer this with my moisturiser/lip balms. First I apply moisturiser, Himalaya lip balm (chota tube wala) and top it off with this. \n\nIt's so inexpensive compared to other lip balms and it's very effective. You get 20gms for 180. I definitely recommend this for people with dry lips. WRP.\n\nBody shop Lip Butter:\n\nIt's a fruity lip balm, it's very moisturising but it's a bit grainy as it's supposed to be exfoliating at the same time. After watching Dr dray, I learnt that exfoliating your lips with a physical scrub is actually harmful. It leaves a light reddish tint on the lips after applying. It's decent, but I'm not looking for a physical scrub in my lip balm. WNRP",

    "body": "Sativa vs. Indica: What to Expect Across Cannabis Types and Strains\n\nThings to consider\n\nThe two main types of cannabis, sativa and indica, are used for a number of medicinal and recreational purposes.\n\n**Sativas** are known for their “head high,” an invigorating, energizing effect that can help reduce anxiety or stress and increase creativity and focus.\n\n**Indicas** are typically associated with full-body effects, such as increasing deep relaxation and reducing insomnia.\n\nAlthough research examining these effects is limited, it appears these plants have more in common than previously thought.\n\nMany in the cannabis industry have moved away from the terms Indica, Sativa and hybrid and started classifying the different “strains” or, more correctly, “chemovars” as:\n\nType I: high THC\n\nType II: THC/CBD combined\n\nType III: high CBD\n\nMore and more, the cannabis industry is moving away from the term “strains” and using chemovars (chemical varieties) instead, since the word “strain” is often used to refer to bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn other words, the category, or type, of cannabis may not be the greatest indicator of the effects you’ll experience.\n\nHere’s how to find the right plant for your needs, strains to consider, potential side effects, and more.\n\nWhat should you look for to understand strain effects?\n\nThe often-applied rule of thumb is that sativas are more invigorating and energizing, while indicas are more relaxing and calming — but it isn’t really that simple.\n\nIndividual plants produce varying effects, even among the same type of cannabis. It all depends on the plant’s chemical composition and the growing technique used.\n\nInstead of looking at the type alone — sativa or indica — look at the description the grower and dispensary provide.\n\nOftentimes, the plant types are broken down into specific chemovars, or breeds.\n\nChemovars are distinguished by their individual cannabinoid and terpene content. This “cannabinoid profile” will provide the user with the best information to help them determine which chemovar is best suited for them.\n\nRelying on names does not provide the user with the necessary information to pick the correct profile. These compounds are what determine the chemovar’s overall effects.\n\nCannabinoids\n\nCannabis plants contain dozens of chemical compounds called cannabinoids.\n\nThese naturally occurring components are responsible for producing many of the effects — both negative and positive — of cannabis use.\n\nResearchers still don’t understand what all of the cannabinoids do, but they have identified two main ones — tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) — as well as several less common compounds.\n\nThese include:\n\n**THC**. THC is the main psychoactive compound in cannabis plants. It’s responsible for the “high” or state of euphoria associated with cannabis use. Levels of THC have been increasing as growers try to create hybrids with a greater concentration of the compound.\n\n**CBD**. CBD is non-impairing or non-euphoric. It doesn’t cause a “high.” However, it may produce many physical benefits, such as reducing pain and nausea, preventing seizures, and easing migraine.\n\n**CBN**. Cannabinol (CBN) is used to ease symptoms and side effects of neurological conditions, including epilepsy, seizures, and uncontrollable muscle stiffness.\n\n**THCA**. Tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA) is similar to THC, but it doesn’t cause any psychoactive effects. Its potential benefits include reducing inflammation caused by arthritis and autoimmune diseases. It may also help reduce symptoms of neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease and ALS.\n\n**CBG**. Cannabigerol (CBG) is thought to help reduce anxiety and symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.\n\nTerpenes\n\nA great deal of attention is paid to the amount of THC and CBD in a given strain, but newer research suggests that terpenes may be just as impactful.\n\nTerpenes are another naturally occurring compound in the cannabis plant.\n\nThe terpenes present directly affect the plant’s smell. They may also influence the effects that specific strains produce.\n\nAccording to Leafly, common terpenes include:\n\n**Bisabolol**. With notes of chamomile and tea tree oil, the terpene bisabolol is thought to help reduce inflammation and irritation. It may also have microbial and pain-reducing effects.\n\n**Caryophyllene**. The peppery, spicy molecule may help reduce anxiety, ease symptoms of depression, and improve ulcers.\n\n**Linalool**. Linalool is said to help improve relaxation and boost mood with its floral notes.\n\n**Myrcene**. The most common terpene, this earthy, herbal molecule may help reduce anxiety and insomnia so you can sleep better.\n\n**Ocimene**. This terpene produces notes of basil, mango, and parsley. Its primary effects may include easing congestion and warding off viruses and bacteria.\n\n**Pinene**. As the name suggests, this terpene produces an intense pine aroma. It may help boost memory, reduce pain, and ease some of the not-so-pleasant symptoms of THC, such as nausea and coordination problems.\n\n**Terpinolene**. Cannabis with this compound may smell like apples, cumin, and conifers. It may have sedative, antibacterial, and antifungal properties.\n\n**Limonene**. Bright, zippy citrus notes come from this terpene. It’s said to improve mood and reduce stress.\n\n**Humulene**. This terpene is deeply earthy and woody, like hops or cloves. Cannabis strains with this molecule may help reduce inflammation.\n\n**Eucalyptol**. With notes of eucalyptus and tea tree oil, this molecule is refreshing and invigorating. It may also help reduce inflammation and fight bacteria.\n\n**Sativa in-depth**\n\nOrigin: Cannabis sativa is found primarily in hot, dry climates with long sunny days. These include Africa, Central America, Southeast Asia, and portions of Western Asia.\n\nPlant description: Sativa plants are tall and thin with finger-like leaves. They can grow taller than 12 feet, and they take longer to mature than some other types of cannabis.\n\nTypical CBD to THC ratio: Sativa often has lower doses of CBD and higher doses of THC.\n\nCommonly associated effects of use: Sativa often produces a “mind high,” or an energizing, anxiety-reducing effect. If you use sativa-dominant strains, you may feel productive and creative, not relaxed and lethargic.\n\nDaytime or nighttime use: Because of its stimulating impact, you can use sativa in the daytime.\n\nPopular strains: Three popular sativa strains are Acapulco Gold, Panama Red, and Durban Poison.\n\n**Indica in-depth**\n\nOrigin: Cannabis indica is native to Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Turkey. The plants have adapted to the often harsh, dry, and turbulent climate of the Hindu Kush mountains.\n\nPlant description: Indica plants are short and stocky with bushy greenery and chunky leaves that grow wide and broad. They grow faster than sativa, and each plant produces more buds.\n\nTypical CBD to THC ratio: Indica strains often have higher levels of CBD, but the THC content isn’t necessarily less.\n\nCommonly associated effects of use: Indica is sought after for its intensely relaxing effects. It may also help reduce nausea and pain and increase appetite.\n\nDaytime or nighttime use: Because of its deep relaxation effects, indica is better consumed at night.\n\nPopular strains: Three popular indica strains are Hindu Kush, Afghan Kush, and Granddaddy Purple.\n\n**Hybrid in-depth**\n\nEach year, cannabis growers produce new and unique strains from different combinations of parent plants. These cannabis hybrids are often grown to target specific effects.\n\nOrigin: Hybrids are typically grown on farms or in greenhouses from a combination of sativa and indica strains.\n\nPlant description: The appearance of hybrid strains depends on the combination of the parent plants.\n\nTypical CBD to THC ratio: Many hybrid cannabis plants are grown in order to increase the THC percentage, but each type has a unique ratio of the two cannabinoids.\n\nCommonly associated effects of use: Farmers and producers select hybrids for their unique impacts. They can range from reducing anxiety and stress to easing symptoms of chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nDaytime or nighttime use: This depends on the predominant effects of the hybrid.\n\nPopular strains: Hybrids are typically classified as indica-dominant (or indica-dom), sativa-dominant (sativa-dom), or balanced. Popular hybrids include Pineapple Express, Trainwreck, and Blue Dream.\n\n**Ruderalis in-depth**\n\nA third type of cannabis, Cannabis ruderalis, also exists. However, it isn’t widely used because it usually doesn’t produce any potent effects.\n\nOrigin: Ruderalis plants adapt to extreme environments, such as Eastern Europe, Himalayan regions of India, Siberia, and Russia. These plants grow quickly, which is ideal for the cold, low-sunlight environments of these places.\n\nPlant description: These small, bushy plants rarely grow taller than 12 inches, but they grow rapidly. One can go from seed to harvest in little more than a month.\n\nTypical CBD to THC ratio: This strain typically has little THC and higher amounts of CBD, but it may not be enough to produce any effects.\n\nCommonly associated effects of use: Because of its low potency, ruderalis isn’t routinely used for medicinal or recreational purposes.\n\nDaytime or nighttime use: This cannabis plant produces very few effects, so it can be used at any time.\n\nPopular strains: On its own, ruderalis isn’t a popular cannabis option. However, cannabis farmers may breed ruderalis with other cannabis types, including sativa and indica. The plant’s rapid growth cycle is a positive attribute for producers, so they may want to combine more potent strains with ruderalis strains to create a more desirable product.\n\n**Potential side effects and risks**\n\nAlthough cannabis use is often associated with potential benefits, it can also produce unwanted side effects.\n\nThis includes:\n\ndry mouth\n\ndry eyes\n\ndizziness\n\nanxiety\n\nparanoia\n\nlethargy\n\nincreased heart rate\n\ndecreased blood pressure\n\nMost of these effects are associated with THC, not CBD or other cannabinoids. However, any cannabis product can produce side effects.\n\nThe method of use may increase your risk for side effects, too.\n\nFor example, smoking or vaping cannabis can irritate your lungs and airways. This may lead to coughing and respiratory problems.\n\nOral cannabis preparations, such as gummies or cookies, are less likely to affect your overall respiratory health.\n\nHowever, though the effects are felt more slowly, ingested cannabis, especially THC, is more potent as it converts to 11-hydroxy-THC, which produces stronger psychoactive effects that can last for hours and in some people, days.\n\n**Strains to consider for certain conditions**\n\nKeep in mind that the potency of cannabinoids and terpenes will vary among growers, and while certain strains may be helpful for certain conditions, your own experience may vary.\n\n**How to choose the right product for you**\n\nWhen you’re looking for the right cannabis product for you, keep these considerations in mind:\n\nKnow what you’re trying to achieve. What you’re trying to feel or treat will help you narrow your options. Talk with the dispensary employee about your goals for cannabis use, whether that’s treating insomnia, reducing anxiety, or increasing energy.\n\nUnderstand your tolerance. Some strains, such as Pineapple Express, are considered “entry level.” Their effects are typically mild and tolerable. Strains with higher levels of cannabinoids may be too potent for a first-time user.\n\nConsider your medical history. While cannabis is a natural product, it can cause intense effects. Before you try cannabis, you need to consider possible interactions with existing medical conditions and medications. When in doubt, ask a doctor or other healthcare professional about your individual benefits and potential risks.\n\nDecide on a desired consumption method. Each technique for consuming cannabis has benefits and drawbacks. If you smoke or vape cannabis, you may feel effects more quickly, but it can irritate your lungs and airways. Gummies, chewables, and foods may be easier to tolerate, but the effects take longer, and they may be much more potent than inhalation.\n\n**The bottom line**\n\nIf you’re curious about how cannabis might help you, talk with a doctor or other healthcare professional, or speak with a knowledgeable cannabis clinician.\n\nThey can discuss its potential positive and negative effects on your individual health and help you find something that suits your needs.\n\nThen, you can begin to explore your options. Finding the right option for you may take time. You may also find that you don’t tolerate cannabis well.\n\n[https://www.healthline.com/health/sativa-vs-indica](https://www.healthline.com/health/sativa-vs-indica)",

        "body": "modern day ruderalis absolutely has medicinal value, and it especially has value for home growers with limited space\n\na lot of \"landrace\" cannabis has also been selected for high THC by local farmers over generations as well. its likely we are responsible for spreading the plant around the globe too\n\nmost medicinal cannabis is hybridised beyond sativa/indica meaning anything relevent. The sativa/indica split is generally someones opinion on the growth and effects of the plant and nothing to do with genetics nor will it account for diveristy seed to seed which can lean from one parent to the other and all over the place inbetween. even growing identical clones, in different environments, genetic expression can vary and this lead to fairly different end products as far as test results go\n\nnew users should start with high CBD low THC and move the THC up if necessary. 2:1 to 1:1 CBD:THC products generally have best benefit to side effect (the high) ratio for new users",

    "body": "Hey guys. Balea MED Ultra Sensitive Waschgel is a very famous product among people who has very sensitive and dry skin. They all swore that this product is their holy grail and a must in their routine. I have a **combination-oily acne prone skin, suffered fungal acne** and still is, but decided to give this product a try. The product is gel-textured and really nice on your skin. It has no fragrance, which is essential in my everyday routine. It should left my skin hydrated but unfortunately this product does not agree with my skin. My skin doesn't like it very much because somehow after rinsing off the cleanser, my skin feels a bit tight and a bit itchy. I believe this is due to the ingredients in the product that can aggravate fungal acne.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAQUA, GLYCERIN, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, **~~GLYCERYL OLEATE~~**, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, **~~SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE~~**, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRIC ACID, **~~HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE~~**, TOCOPHEROL.\n\nThe bolded and strikedthrough ingredients may be the culprit behind the aggravation of fungal acne. Until now I can't stop scratching cheeks and forehead lightly. URGH\n\nThese are my honest review, like always you guys should take it with a grain of salt. I'm not against this product, it's just that my skin hates it.\n\nDifferent people have different reaction to different products. Find one that suits you.\n\nIf you still haven't found your holy grail, don't worry. Be thankful for the journey of finding them, because you will learn a lot, not only about which ingredient is good or bad, but also discovering about yourself and building your mental strength :)\n\n(No worries tho, I've given the cleanser to my boyfriend who has combination dry skin, and his skin is loving it, so it's a win-win situation here)",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nI received  the [Dong Sung Rannce C-Serum](https://smile.amazon.com/Dong-Sung-Rannce-C-Serum-1-52oz/dp/B06WGR2W3R) as a gift from a friend but wasn't able to find any mention of it on this sub, so I decided to make a review for anyone interested. I'm very verbose, sorry \\^\\^;;\n\n##Some background on me (Iz long, feel free to skip):\n\nI'm very new to AB (this is my first product, and I got it unintentionally!),  I've been lurking for a few months, but I'm not new to layering products for moisture. I've had severe eczema for 20+ years, since I was 4, and it's full body. My face actually only had eczema for a couple of years, and besides that has only been dry. The rest of my body has been bad enough that there have been times where I would *need* to apply 3 layers of stuff full body 3+ times a day [if you have any morbid curiousity, googling severe eczema yield images that describe what my body was like for years]. My eczema has been really good the past few years because the external factors that triggered it the most are under control/lessened, I've found a routine that does a good job for hydration/maintaining my skin, and my skin is getting stronger from staying decent and having minimal flare ups.\n\n\nMy routine for both my face and body right now is: Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream followed by [pure shea butter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D7MB55C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), once or twice a day. On the weakest/most damaged areas of skin I'll add CeraVe before the shea.  Sometimes I'll use a prescribed medicated ointment rather than shea butter, and if I'm out of shea butter I'll use vaseline. The third layer I used to use would always be a cream (always changed, but recently it's been CeraVe after I learned more about the skin barrier. I'd tried it before but tried to replace Cetaphil with it and found it worthless as a moisturizer for my body, but it works wonderfully on top of Cetaphil), but that's too heavy for me now. \n\n\nWhile the layers are good enough, I feel like my body would prefer a water-y layer  before hand, and western body lotions don't fit the role my skin wants. I came to this routine after lots of trial and error with western products and finding that while no single product worked great; the ones  mentioned were the best for my sensitivity, dryness, and healing, and more so when used together. My discovery of AB gives me hope I'll find a product that fits my skin's needs (I'm eyeing some of the Japanese lotions like Kikumasamune).\n\n##Product Info:\n\nAdvanced formula + skin Brightening Serum for Clear and Brighter Complexion with a Healthy Glow\n\n- Advanced melanin care brightening serum with a-Bisbolol, helping to even out dark spots, age spots and freckles.\n\n- Optimized fusion of kojic acid and stabilized vitamin C makes your skin clear and brighter with a healthy glow.\n\n- Fast-absorbing and intensive hydrating serum for all skin types, giving smoother texture and long-lasting moisture.\n\n- Synergistic effect on brightening skin complexion if used with DONGSUNG RANNCE CREAM.\n\n\n*Active Ingredients*:  a-Bisabolol, Kojic Acid, Hydrolyzed Placental Extract, Stabilized Vitamin C (Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate)\n\nThe product is watery in consistency, and the color is sort of milky. There wasn't a smell that I noticed, but I'm not known or my keen sense of smell.\n\n##Review:\n\nSo this is the first AB product I've tried, and first product that I've used that had any claims besides basic moisture. So I have no experience with other AB products, or serums at all.\n\n[images of Dong Sung Rannce C-Serum](https://imgur.com/a/tLDjK)\n\n\nBoth my mom and I used this product. While I only have dry and dehydrated skin (on my face anyway), my mother has dry, aged and damaged skin, with some really dark age spots on her cheeks. We've used it now for about 1.5 months, and used it as the first layer before using our regular routine. My mom uses whatever random moisturizer she's using that month and shea butter on top.\n\n\nI really love it. My skin feels more hydrated, and stays that way all day long. It feels like my skin's thirst is quenched, if you will. I also noticed that my skin looks brighter and more glowy (dewy?). \n\n\nMy mother's noticed the same things, and her dark spots are less pronounced than they used to be.\n\n\nWe both really like it and are considering purchasing it despite its price ($45) and our cheap ass-ness. My friend said she found it in the K-Beauty section at her local H-Mart. My mom especially wants to purchase it because she was working 60-70hrs for the majority of her life as a single mom, and skincare wasn't even a consideration. Now she has the time and energy, but the damage has been done (yes, she uses sunscreen and stuff now, but she didn't know about this stuff when it would've been a preventative step).\n\n\n**TL;DR** Iz good. Yay hydration. Yay brightening and evening of skin tone.\n",

I also highly recommend the Cerave PM lotion for facial use.",

    "body": "\nCLEANSERS\nAvene Xeracalm Lipid Replenishing cleansing oil - HG status for me. This is not a regular oil cleanser, it’s a lightly foaming second cleanser that is incredibly healing if you have any sensitivity or barrier issues. Perfect post procedure and for AM cleansing. 10/10 WRP\n\nCurel Foaming Cleanser - also HG status. The foam is rich and hydrating. Never stripping. I like using it as a second cleanser at night. 10/10 WRP\n\nCurel Makeup remover gel - a thick cool gel that’s Unscented and very gentle. Zero irritation. I don’t wear makeup so not sure if it’s effective at removing makeup but it’s great if you’re just wearing a bb cream or sunscreen. 9/10 WRP\n\nHale and Hush Quiet Wash - this is a lightly foaming gentle cleanser. Also great for sensitive skin. Foams a bit more than the Avene Xeracalm. I liked it a lot but not as much as the Avene and it’s more expensive. 7/10 For that reason WNRP. \n\nAvene Cicalfate cleanser - got this from a Euro store. Light blue liquid that foams up and is great for sensitive skin. The Xeracalm IMHO is better bc it’s more hydrating but this was nice too. I didn’t like the flip top as much as the Xeracalm pump. 8/10 WNRP\n\nLe Mieux Exfoliating Cleanser - I love Le Mieux and this wasn’t too expensive. It has a light orange scent. It was too irritating for my skin, so I used it on my body. I’m not sure I like exfoliating cleansers as much as toners for whatever reason. 5/10\n\nThen I Met You Living Cleansing Balm - I guess this has a cult following. It smells divine. Gorgeous citrus scent. Not too irritating for a scented product. Works very well at removing oil and dirt. So smooth and melts down into a creamy oil. I am just so so sensitive to fragrance that I’m not sure I’ll get this again. If you are ok with natural fragrance you might love this. WNRP 7/10\n\nKrave Makeup Rewind - love this jelly like cleanser. It has a subtle grape scent. Invisible liquid jelly texture that’s more effective at cleansing than the Curel. It’s about twice as much but you don’t need as much. My skin felt soothed by this. I’ll likely get this again when they have a sale. 10/10 WRP\n\nElta MD Oil in Gel Cleanser - this is an interesting product that starts off as a gel that then turns into an oil. Really gentle and also effective as a first cleanser, and it has some mild enzymes in it. I am very careful with how much exfoliation I do so I wouldn’t make this my regular daily cleanser but I think many people would love this. MRP 8/10\n\nCerave Acne Foaming Wash 4% BP - my HG for treating acne. I can fine tune how much treatment (and irritation) I get from it by adjusting how long I let it sit on my face. It’s benzoyl peroxide so it’s going to be irritating but it’s far less irritating than a leave on treatment and every other BP Wash I’ve tried. If you struggle with acne highly recommend this. WRP 10/10\n\n\nSPF, ESSENCES, MASKS\nEucerin Oil Control Sun Gel - from Europe, my HG SPF during the summer. Great filters. Amazing natural finish. You can use a lot of this without it making your skin look like ass. It’s a little drying bc of the alcohol content, so I stop using this during winter months. WRP 10/10\n\nSkin Aqua Moisture Gel SPF - lovely finish. I doubt it’s SPF rating so I use it on my body when I’m working from home and it’s summer. It’s more like a lotion that maybe provides some sun protection. WRP 6/10 only bc I doubt the SPF rating \n\nNeogenesis Volcanic Ash Mask - a creamy black clay mask with minerals. It’s got an almond or light citrus smell to it, but it’s faint and not irritating. I really love this mask. It’s gentle but will help clear pores. I like using an exfoliating toner before hand and then wipe this off with a warm wet towel and my skin feels calm and glowing. WRP 9/10\n\nSkinceuticals B5 gel mask - super thick gel mask that’s great when my skin feels irritated or dry. It can tingle at first, not sure why, but it subsides, and my skin is calm and hydrated afterwards. It took me about 9 months to use this occasionally, it’s nice to have around when I want a gentle mask. WRP 8/10\n\nAvene Eau Thermal - very soothing mineral water. It does seem to calm my skin but not sure if that’s bc of the cool temperature or the water itself. I like the Amorepacific a lot more so doubt I’ll repurchase this but maybe. MRP 7/10\n\nAmorepacific Vintage Single Extract - HG status. People say this is just like other green tea toners but I disagree. My skin feels noticeably calm and clear when I use this. It’s amazing even post procedure. I crave this after I get out of the shower. It’s not super hydrating but it’s not drying either. I love this so much I’m probably going to try the 1,000 day version of there’s a sale for Black Friday. WRP 10/10 \n\nKlair’s Unscented Prep Toner - a thick viscous toner that’s very hydrating and has some soothing qualities. I actually feel the Amorepacific is more soothing than this even tho the Klair’s is packed w more soothing ingredients. Klair’s is definitely more hydrating. That said I’ve been mostly  using the Amorepacific so this isn’t getting used as much. I will reach for this when my skin is extra dry and I want to layer a hydrating toner several times. WRP 9/10\n\nMD Solar Sciences BB Crème SPF 50 - HG status. Incredible finish. Four tints. A primarily zinc formulation that’s great for sensitive skin. It’s not super drying like many zinc SPFs there are hydrating ingredients and some nice antioxidants. WRP 10/10\n\nMOISTURIZERS AND SERUMS\nLe Mieux Sheer Hydration - this continues to be a HG status for me. It had a high percentage of Bisabolol, Allantoin and that makes it incredibly soothing. Dries down to a natural skin like finish. WRP 10/10 \n\nPeach & Lily Glass Skin Gel Moisturizer - HG as one of my hydrating layers, it’s very hydrating. Feels like a serum in gel formula. Soothing, brightening and calming. I like to use this prior to tretinoin.  WRP 10/10\n\nPeach & Lily Glass Skin Serum - HG. I’ve realized that I am sensitive to niacinamide in higher concentrations. This has 2% and never causes any issues. It’s basically an amped up hyaluronic serum with some calming, brightening and anti aging ingredients. I love how I can use it no matter what is going on with my skin. WRP 10/10\n\nNeogenesis Recovery - HG if I had to limit my serums to just one, it would be this one. If you struggle with sensitive, rosacea nothing beats this. And my skin just feels resilient and healthy. I have cut my budget for other products (like nicer cleansers) just so I can keep using this. WRP 10/10\n\nNeogenesis Eye Serum - HG. Plumps and even lifts my eye area a tiny bit. It’s super gentle and can be used everywhere. And it’s not that expensive for working better than any other eye product I’ve tried. WRP 10/10\n\nSkinceuticals Phloretin CF Gel - the only ascorbic acid serum I can use daily without issue. Surprisingly non sensitizing. Not drying either even tho it was alcohol. It’s made a big difference in my skins luminosity and fading pigmentation. I adore this. WRP 10/10\n\nPeach & Lily Copper Peptide Serum - very hydrating copper peptide serum. Thicker and more soothing than the NIOD. I am not sure what it’s doing. I did repurchase but not sure I’ll keep using it as I’m liking other products more. MRP 8/10\n\nReplenix Caffeine Calming serum - a green tea gel serum that has a high percentage of polyphenols. It’s soothing and calming and you can tell it’s a high quality green tea serum, but I think the Amorepacific essence is better. For that reason will not repurchase. WNRP 8/10\n\nNIOD modulating Glucosides - this is a really great product for rosacea. It’s so calming. It’s like a light tan yellow creamy serum that feels like an immediate anti irritant. I’ve reached for this when my skin was at its driest and most sensitized. That said I use other products that I like better but maybe will repurchase. MRP 8/10\n\nPeach & Lily Lactic Acid Serum - a really gentle lactic acid serum free from fragrance. I liked it but it was a bit strong for me (it’s not super strong, my skin is just very sensitive). I like the Dr Dennis Peel Pads better than this. WNRP 7/10\n\nTimeless 20% ascorbic acid serum - used this on my arms and legs. Shit is strong and absolutely works to fade tans and pigment. Way too strong for my face but will repurchase for my body. WRP 8/10\n\nNecessaire Body Retinol - also very strong and very effective. It mixes 10% AHA and 0.1% retinol and it quickly softens skin. It’s a thick yellow gel that has a scent that some don’t like but I didn’t mind it. It fades. It does feel like it leaves a film on your skin which I don’t love and it’s hard to spread. I spritz with the avene water and then wipe it on. It’s effective. But I don’t use it as much as I should bc of the finish. MRP 6/10\n\nEltaMD AM moisturizer - a nice gel moisturizer that has niacinamide in it. I thought it left a bit of a shine. Not as good as Le Mieux and bc it has niacinamide in it, it was a little irritating to me to use this in addition to the Peach & Lily Glass Skin Serum. I could see this working well for a simple routine for someone with mostly normal to oily/combo skin. WNRP 6/10\n\nFinacea 15% Azelaic Acid - gel lotion formula that helps keep acne and redness under control. I love it more in the summer but in the winter when I’m dryer and not breaking out as much, I tend to drop this. Still HG status. WRP 10/10\n\nAltreno 0.05% tretinoin - HG status - hands down the best tretinoin formulation. Altreno is the first tret i could use every day without issue. All the benefits of Tret with minimal side effects. WRP 10/10",

I've read the wiki and a lot of the posts here. I've analyzed the ingredients of tons of products out there (mainly with incidecoder). I've searched for ncbi/pubmed articles for every ingredient, for it's effectiveness against eczema. I've made a chart of all the oils and butters, comparing their fatty acid profile, comedogenic rating, absorption rate, and what people say about it. And finally I've come up with a list of ingredients that I think (theoretically) should be ideal for dry eczema-prone skin.\n\n-----\n\n**The goodies:**\n\n62.4% Water\n\n15% Oils (not sure about exact ratio yet, probably all 1/4)\n\n- Jojoba oil\n\n- Grapeseed oil\n\n- Oat oil\n\n- Avocado oil\n\n5% Petrolatum\n\n5% Glycerine\n\n3% Niacinamide\n\n2% Panthenol (75%)\n\n0.025% Aloe Vera (Powder, 200x, so should become 5% gel)\n\n2% Licorice\n\n0.5% Alpha-bisabolol (the primary compound of Chamomile)\n\n---\n\n**Emulsifiers, Preservates, etc.**\n\n4% Emulsifying Wax (Cetearyl Alcohol & Polysorbate 60)\n\n0.75% C-kons (Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin)\n\n0.4% Potassium Sorbate\n\n0.2% Disodium EDTA\n\nSodium Hydroxide (as needed) \n\n----\n\nI haven't been able to find a good site that gives me the ideal pH etc. for every ingredient, so I'm hoping they'll all function between 4.5-7 pH. Same goes for melting points, so I'm not sure about the phases. Judging by the ingredients mentioned in the wiki I think its like this, but please correct me if I'm wrong:\n\nHeated water phase: water, aloe vera, glycerin, niacinamide, disodium EDTA\n\nHeated oil phase: oils, petrolatum, emulsifying wax\n\nCool down phase: panthenol, licorice, alpha-bisabolol, c-kons & potassium sorbate (preservatives), sodium hydroxide",

        "body": "I like how well thought-out this formula looks! \n\nPetrolatum is the optimal amount here to prevent TEWL. I have the same skin issue and can add that being free-handed with the glycerin can be actually nice (stickiness comes in with serums but not emulsions in my experience). I loved a heavier cream with 10%. But usually glycerin is between 1-3%. \n\nNiacinamide seems to occur with acids these days, it seems that the need to adhere to near-neutral pH was a bit overblown in the past (I can’t point to any specific research at this point). Such skin benefits from lower pH. Also, the sorbate needs low pH (wouldn’t go above 5) to function.\n\nA couple of sidenotes. Phenoxy is famous for thinning emulsions. You already have a non-thick formula, so a gelling agent would be definitely advised, like 0.2% xanthan gum (you can mix with glycerin, and then add the water). I’d add more cetyl or cetearyl alcohol or whichever thickener is available too. More liquid formulas separate easier. It’s good to add phenoxy in increments and mix in slowly.\n\nWhat you might encounter is soaping (this white cast while rubbing the lotion in). Can be fixed with just 1% dimethicone. It’s a bit excessive advice, but in case you’re making an order.",

        "body": "Pretty good, and very well researched.\n\nOil profiles are a deep hole to fall down. Very interesting stuff there, but not always helpful when actually formulating. I'd lose the grapeseed oil for some MCT or CCT, but mostly because the high linoleic acid makes for quick rancidity. I tend to use rice bran oil and high oleic safflower for body lotions because they feel nice, are unlikely to be a problem for anyone, don't smell strong, are inexpensive, and have at least a 6 month shelf life in lotion.\n\nI'd strongly recommend that you up the e-wax to 5% to keep it at 25% of your slightly more than 20% oil phase, and because the phenxyethanol/EHG in the preservative can destabilize fragile emulsions. Do a test batch without the expensive additives to make sure that it won't fail after you put in the preservatives. And it's never a bad thing to have some plain lotion anyway. Sometimes even \"soothing\" actives can be too much for irritated skin.\n\nNiacinamide is fine in the pH range you need for your preservatives. The pH 6 thing isn't as big of an issue as people claim.\n\nFor my own very dry and sensitive skin, I'd choose a different preservative system entirely. Also, I am super lazy and like things that work without as much fuss as using very pH dependent stuff like sorbates requires. If you do find that it irritates your skin and you know you're ok with everything else in it, you might be having a reaction to those preservatives, especially K sorbate. For efficacy, I'm pretty sure that you should get it to a pH of less than 5, preferably around 4.5. You probably aren't going to need NaOH to bring it up, more likely to need some citric acid solution to bring it down.",

I recently called my dermatologist and asked if there was any way to get a discount since it has more than tripled its price from the first time I bought it. They granted me a discount that brings it down to $136, and the rep mentioned that prices are rising for them too.\n\nConsidering that the cost for this has been ballooning for quite a while I [suppressed a sigh](https://64.media.tumblr.com/17608cffb0a5ae17eb6ec8d31f1c44aa/tumblr_p2oe7hm50R1relg8bo1_640.gifv), knowing there is no way that is completely true.

If you or any dermatologists happen upon this let me know, because at this rate it will probably hit the $200 mark by 2025.\n\nSo CALLING ALL RETINOID JUNKIES OR OBSESSIVES: Considering what you know and I don't, is this retinoid even worth it?

This potent product is custom compounded with prescription strength retinoic acid and Arbutase® (Hydroquinoine alternative) skin lightening agent.\n\nM2 Cream helps manage skin tone and may be used as part of daily maintenance regimens or for pre-treating & sustaining in-office skin brightening peel applications and is custom compounded to your individual skin type at the time of purchase. For women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, the custom compounds may be omitted allowing for safe ongoing management of pigmentation during that time. Because the product is prescription in nature it requires that you are an established patient to our practice to purchase.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Isopropyl palmitate, Cetearyl alcohol, Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, PPG-15 Stearyl ether, Ceteareth-20, Kojic dipalmitate, Pentylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Hydrogenated lecithin, Tocopherol, Sodium oleate, Oligopeptide-68, Glycerin, Rumex occidentalis extract, Evodia rutaecarpa fruit extract, L-Ergothioneine, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum silicate, Steareth-2, Steareth-21, 1,2 Hexanediol, Caprylyl glycol, Allantoin, Potassium sorbate, Bisabolol, Zingiber officinale (ginger) root extract, Feruloyl soy glycerides, Hydroxypinacolone retinoate, Sodium metabislufite, Xanthan gum, Edetate disodium and BHT.",

Q2 Revenues will be significantly better than Q1 in Consumer Revenues (i.e., $34.6MM). The product mix of D2C/BaM was 57%/43% in Q1 and will likely shift closer to 50/50% for reasons explained below.\n2. 2022 Full Year Consumer Revenues are expected to be over 150% growth (i.e., north of $250MM in revenue) compared to 2021 in Consumer Revenues (i.e., \\~$92MM) and 2019 in Consumer revenues (i.e., \\~$17MM).\n\nThis is driven by category leading brands (i.e., Biossance - skincare, JVN - hair care, RoseInc - Color Cosmetics, and Pipette - Clean Babycare)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Future Revenue Expectations\n\n(Based on Brands previously launched and expected to launch this year)\n\n$1Bn in revenue by 2024\n\n$2Bn in revenue by 2025\n\n(IRR: With the current BB1 & BB2 and Consumer Production Facilities, they will have the capacity to meet the expectations)\n\n4. Q1 was 56% of revenue from D2C\n\n(IRR note: Earnings call said 57%)\n\n5. Q2 and for the rest of 2022 Amyris will see significant expansion in productivity and unit performance at the store level which means sales per square foot per week per each brand.\n\nThats where Melo sees growth due to stores opening and consumers flowing in.\n\n(IRR Commentary: Most of this expansion will be from the Brick and Mortar side as a result of items such as these:\n\na. Biossance has been rolling into Kohls/Sephora; SpaceNK and PerfurmeriaeCompanhia as well as Asia with a larger and fuller benefit to hit in Q2\n\nb. Menolabs only had a few weeks of inclusion for Q1, a full quarter in Q2 will add >$500k ;\n\nc. JVN only was rolling into Sephora and SpaceNK stores in March ; a full quarter in Q2 will shift mix closer to 50/50 by growing BaM demand;\n\nd. Pipette rolled into 4,000 Walmart stores in Q2;\n\ne. RoseInc expanding into the UK with a smaller but similar in nature benefit in Q2;\n\nf. Promotional sales are planned for Biossance and JVN in Memorial Day and June\n\nf. Further BaM progress in 2022 in Q3 and Q4 from:\n\n\\- Launching Biossance into \\~140 Douglas Germany Stores and various channels into China and further penetration into Kohls/Sephora\n\n\\- Launching Menolabs into CVS (based on our primary research, it is already in pilot program in various CVS stores today)\n\n\\- Launching JVN and Rose Inc. into Brazil\n\n\\- Launching a new Walmart brand starting in haircare into 4,000+ Walmart stores (expected in Q4...most likely November) and expected to be profitably day one due to reduced marketing and selling expenses and upfront payments\n\n\\- Launching Stripes (possibly into Sephora). A misconception is that Stripes will compete with MenoLabs, but Stripes will focus on Skincare and Bodycare whereas Menolabs will focus on Ingestibles and Probiotics)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Leading Brands:**\n\n1. Biossance: .\n\nA. The Biossance brand is on a >$100MM run-rate (this translates to over $160MM to $170MM in retail sales) and growing significantly\n\nB. Currently Selling to 28 to 34 year olds in 5 major US markets (this demographic and geography account for 90% of Biossance sales)\n\nC. Leading Brand: Biossance\n\n\\- John Melo stated that the Latest Serum (a Biossance Brand) has become the number 1 skin care serum in the world's leading skin care market (i.e., China)\n\n\\- China expected to do >$15MM in revenues in 2022 vs. $2MM in 2021 (Focused on Biossance)\n\n\\- Q2 has had significant growth as well todate.\n\n\\- Biossance is on TMall today (which has allowed Amyris to stay online) which has led to no direct impact from lockdowns.\n\n\\- Biossance is expanding into Sephora's stores in China.\n\n\\- As lockdowns free up, Amyris has an opportunity to accelerate access\n\n\\- (IRR: We have seen a significant push with Chinese Influencers which appears to be showing improvement in TMall Biossance sales)\n\n\\- On the global side, Skincare has had an amazing rebound.as a result of things like Zoom calls where we are looking at ourselves constantly\n\n2. Leading Hare care Brand: JVN:\n\n\\- JVN is the fastest growing clean hair care brand in North America.\n\n\\- It is Expanding significantly in door counts.\n\n\\- Having a field day in the UK and has surpassed Olaplex in Space NK in the UK\n\n\\- It is Launching in Brazil (Jonathan Van Ness is popular in Brazil and looking forward to the brand).\n\n\\- Brazil is also the leading country in hair care.\n\n\\- It is the top performing Amyris D2C brand with over 70% in sales with 80% gross margins\n\n\\- If you have contracted COVID, you are probably experiencing more hair loss than normal\n\n\\- Whole JVN line is at a $20 average selling price (very accessible for consumer)\n\nMelo showcased a product called a \"prewash scalp oil\" in JVN Brand:\n\na. Two significant benefits: increases hair growth & decreases greying of hair.\n\nb. Over 95% of the ingredients in the product are Amyris produced: Squalane, Hemisqualane, and Bisabolol Life (an ingredient produced for Amyris' partner Givaudin).\n\n3. Leading Color Cosmetics Brand: Rose, Inc.\n\nCategory leader in clean color costmetics\n\n4. Leading Clean Baby Brand Pipette\n\nLeading in Baby by a significant expansion:\n\nShipping into over 4,000 Walmart Stores across North America\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Sephora:**\n\n1. The CEO of Sephora said that the last couple of years he loved the Biossance brand but always thought of it as a niche, but over the last 12 months it has transitioned from a niche brand to a mainstream clean skincare brand that is one of the leaders in the field\n2. Sephora claims to be having the best year in history (with April as the best month ever, which surpassed the prior September). As recent as this week, Consumers are doubling down on beauty and trading down from luxury from bags and shoes to skincare, haircare and color cosmetics for their health and sustainable consumption focus.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Media Strategy**\n\n1. Making Every Dollar Count:\n\nThe Marketing/Advertising Landscape is changing in the Consumer Business:\n\n\\- Changing in part due to privacy laws\n\n\\- Changes in iphone operating system which is moving the weight of consumer to Apple, Amazon and Google\n\n\\- Amyris expects to Reducing media spend by $20MM in 2nd half of the year by changing where they choose to invest\n\n(IRR: We note a drop in Paid Search for Amyris this quarter in line with these statements)\n\n\\- Amyris has a significant partnership with Hearst Publishing (e.g., April Issue of L with 15 pages of editorial inside) resulting in more effective advertising to grow awareness at a much lower investment rate\n\n2. Amyris is pursuing a dedicated Omnichannel strategy (enabling consumers to buy where they are) and using effective digital marketing to do so and to raise awareness\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Europe**\n\n1. When the Ukrainian war started, there was a small slowdown in sales, but it quickly rebounded in UK in a robust way with record days in SpaceNK, across Selfridges and Harrod's and in Amyris' categories.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Pricing**\n\n1. Ingredients Business\n\nAmyris has activated one price increase affecting two ingredients in the ingredient business (IRR believes the two ingredients in question may be Squalene and Hemisqualene) which will have a $10MM annualized positive impact to bottom line (because alternative sources for ingredients supply is crude-oil based, and given where prices are, it has created a big opportunity)\n\n2. Consumer Business\n\nRetailers are asking Amyris what they are thinking about price increases (since Retailers benefit as well from a price increase due to proportionate markups)\n\nOn Entry Point SKUs/brands: Amyris has no expectations for price changes\n\nOn Treatments: There are 3 or 4 SKUs (especially in Biossance brand that are #1 or #2) where Amyris expects to see some inflationary pricing power pushed through\n\n3. Consumer Behaviour\n\nConsumer \"doesn't do what they say\" and \"Does what they need to do\".\n\nThey will not spend more, but will give brand loyalty. (positioning a brand around sustainability is not enough for a business model)\n\nThe pivot to value has been significant recently in the last few months (best performance at better value and a plus if sustainable).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Stripes Brand Related**\n\nMelo discussed Hyaluronic acid which is used in skincare.\n\nHow it functions ahs not great.\n\nIt tries to trap the moisture in your skin. Problem: What If you don't have enough moisture to begin with?\n\nAmyris as a result has focused a lot on perimenopause and menopause market (Menolabs is already up 300% from last year).\n\nA new menopause related brand, STRIPES, leverages an Amyris discovered molecule (IRR believes this is some combination of Ectoine and/or Sclareol as we previously discussed in our first Seeking Alpha article on Amyris) that opens the pore and extracts moisture from nature and puts it inside the skin to give natural effective moisture access.\n\nThe Ingredient has opportunity to significantly displace Hyaluronic acid in the Menopause sector.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Funding & Cash Burn**\n\n1. Q1: Use of Cash in the First Quarter: Distinguishing between \"Cash Burn\" vs. \"Cash Use\"\n\nHeadline: $195MM cash burn\n\nInterpretation/Reach was Company is Dying or going Bankrupt\n\n\"Cash Burn\" was only $134MM in Q1\n\nThis was the lowest of any company in the SynBio sector\n\nExpectations for Amyris is that this will progressively decrease throughout rest of the year\n\nThe remainder of the $195MM was used in Capex and Working Capital\n\nIn part, this was a result of focusing on a \"Just in Case\" inventory world where Amyris was tying up cash in transportation, warehousing, and advance inventory purchase of pumps and bottles (due to much coming from China) essentially derisking by buying inventory in advance (particularly critical path items)\n\n2. TODAY: Focus Now on Net Cash and Releasing Cash\n\nMelo Defined \"Net Cash\" = \"Cash on Hand plus receivables plus inventory minus payables\"\n\nNet Cash Balance - $300MM\n\n(IRR notes other traditional definitions are slightly different where it is \"Cash & Cash Equivalents less Current Liabilities\"; In other words A/R and Inventory would not be part of the equation)\n\nAmyris expects to create access to $700MM to $850MM without any equity issuance or fund raising activity\n\nA. Inventory and Receivables\n\nAmyris expects to release cash from Inventory and receivables - $100MM (IRR: For Q1'22, Inventory was \\~$82.3MM and A/R was \\~$45MM and Contracted Assets was \\~$11.7MM)\n\n(IRR: There are a few alternatives in this regard:\n\nOne is to establish a revolver/credit line against these current assets and is in large part based on the credit worthiness of the \"payors\".  This would still get treated as debt but Amyris maintains the full value of the assets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other is a financing vehicle/method called \"Factoring\" which avoids being treating as debt and is an effective sale (but at a discount) in which:\n\ni. Receivables finance the process\n\nii. Seller (i.e., Amyris) sells goods to a buyer.\n\niii. Seller issues an invoice to the buyer.\n\niv. Seller sells the invoice to the factor.\n\nv. Factor pays the seller a cash advance of typically 70%-90% of the value of the invoice.\n\nvi. Buyer pays the invoice.\n\nvii. Factor sends the balance to the seller with fees deducted.\n\nif and when this happens, it will likely to be a Q3 event.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB. Barra Bonita Financing/Collateralization\n\nReleasing capital from Barra Bonita plant \\~$100MM\n\n(IRR: The valuation on the Barra Bonita Facility is estimated to be between $150MM and $200MM and, after it goes into production (expected in June), it can be financed with a Loan-to-Value ratio of \\~50 to 60% (likely in Q3).)\n\nC. Earnout\n\nThe Earnout with DSM Melo stated was $250MM (IRR: the filings reference a $235MM cap) over the years and can \"potentially\" access a $100MM up front (i.e., an accelerate upfront payment of a portion of the earnout)\n\nD. Strategic Portfolio Rationalization\n\nPreviously, Amyris was focused on ingredients selling B2B\n\nShifting portfolio by exiting B2B sales keeping manufacturing to maximize utilization and reduce COGS\n\nAdvancing rights to market by getting advanced cash payments for licensing\n\n(Expectations to generate at least $250MM form those licensing of Ingredients)\n\n(IRR: This is referencing the two ingredients previously announced\n\nIn total, John Stated this will get AMRS to $700MM to $850MM:\n\n$300MM Net Cash\n\n$100MM Inventory and A/R\n\n$100MM Barra Bonita Financing\n\n$100MM Earnout\n\n$250MM Strategic Rationalization of 2 ingredients (licensing the molecules, but Amyris maintains manufacturing rights)\n\nTotal: $850MM\n\n(the lower end of the range of $700MM that Melo mentioned is likely to account for the probability of one of the items such as the earnout or one of the two ingredients failing to close)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**MARGINS**\n\n1. Real Cost/Cash Opex Base\n\nThe Underlying Cost base is $85MM to $90MM on Cash Opex spend\n\n(IRR: note, this is excluding non-cash items such as D&A)\n\n2. Reductions after Q1\n\nReducing payments to outside third parties and services by about $10MM for the year\n\nReducing marketing and advertising by about $20MM annualized relative to Q1 (half from the portfolio, and also half from an efficiency standpoint).\n\n(IRR: We must remember that Q1 had outsized advertising expenses related to the three brand launches from the end of Q3'21 and Q4'21. Our own primary research already shows a drop in paid search advertising for those three brands in Q2'22)\n\n3. Pick, Pack and Ship\n\nAmyris has been accounting for it in the OPEX line previously\n\nAmyris Will be moving it above the line to COGS as a result of moving PP&S inhouse.\n\nHowever, this will not result in a reduction in Gross Profit Margins because they are transitioning the PP&S expenses to COGS\n\nExpect a 20% reduction in doing that better (which will result in a $20MM in reduction in annual Opex expenditures)\n\nAs an example, the consumer production factory in Brazil (aka \"Interfaces\" (sp?) was bought this year and will make back it's investment in the first 12 months of production.\n\nIt was purchased thinking it would do 35MM units per year (e.g., Biossance, JVN, Rose Inc.); however, since then Melo has indicated that there is plenty of expansion opportunity to 50MM to 60MM units per year\n\nThis will shift the cost base dramatically.\n\n(IRR: the Consumer Production Facility in Brazil runs at a lower cost basis than Reno by 20%\n\nBy expanding and shifting some production of Biossance, Rose Inc., and JVN to Brazil to service both Brazilian and European markets (which will also reduce tariffs to Europe by an estimated 10% to 20%), this will only enhance margins).\n\n4.Scale\n\nThe business needs to get to a $1.5Bn Revenue run-rate to get to full scale and maximum Gross Margins\n\nAt full scale, Gross Margin structure will be 60 to 65% per year\n\nAdjusted EBITDA/(a proxy for Operating Profit) is expected to be at 30 to 35% per year\n\n5. Q4\n\nQ4 expects minimal burn with positive to breakeven cash flows on an operating basis\n\n6. 2023\n\nNext year Amyris expects to achieve an operating profit\n\n(IRR: Based on our own models, we expect Q4'23 operating cash flow profitability)\n\n7. 2024\n\n2024 Net Income positive\n\n(excluding new growth initiatives and mark to market on bonds and other vehicles)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Competition**\n\n1. Gingko\n\nGingko core revenue is down 5%\n\n(65% of that revenue is doing business with themselves)\n\nMelo believes they have solid science and Ginkgo will do more acquisitions to bolster business revenues inorganically (which will leverage their strong balance sheet)\n\n2. Others\n\nMelo does not see anyone else\n\n3. Time frame\n\nMelo believes Amyris is 10 years ahead of other competitors\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Markets**\n\n1. For biotechs\n\nMarkets impacted more extremely specifically non-profitable biotechs....this is equal to if not worse to the dot-com crash\n\n2. Amyris' Largest Shareholder (\"John Doerr\" with \\~30% control)\n\nLargest shareholder funded amazon through the crash (when amazon lost 90% of its value during the dot com crash)\n\nThere was a lot of pressure on Bezos at Amazon to stop spend and change nature of business.\n\nBezos led company to become super shrewd in every dollar invested and radically focused on consumer and executional excellence.\n\n3. Amyris Priorities\n\nThree priorities:\n\na. execute flawlessly,\n\nb. drive the heck out of margin structure & free cash, and\n\nc. invest dollar really well.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**New Products/Portfolio**\n\n1. Ingredient Portfolio\n\nCurrently Amyris has 24 to 26 ingredients in portfolio\n\nThe Hyalauronic acid Amyris substitute is a big opportunity (the equivalent of squalane in opportunity)\n\nSqualane is constrained in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 and will free up in 2nd half of the year\n\n2. Molecule Control Impacts Value\n\nThe original DSM deal that Amyris did (vs ingredients now) generated around $50MM to $75MM per molecule\n\nNow, the majority of molecules Amyris has in its portfolio are fully controlled by Amyris (i.e., \\~80%).\n\nAs a result Amyris is able to realize a higher value. For example, the $250MM strategic deal involves two molecules which each are garnering somewhere between $100MM to >$125MM per molecule in upfront licensing payments as a result of having no limitation in portfolio which is a result of full control.\n\nAdditionally, now that Amyris has mass and scale, they don't need to partner with someone to make a molecule successful since Amyris has direct access to the consumers themselves (lab-to-market is great).\n\n3. Comparable\n\nOlaplex is the best comp in the market (trading at 10x revenue)\n\nAMYRIS is growing faster than Olaplex at 3 to 4x Olaplex when they were at the same level of maturity.....and a better margin structure).\n\nAlready in the UK, Amyris brand has surpassed Olaplex.\n\nAmyris has a higher cost base ($70MM per year - that is less than competitors like Zymergen).\n\nOlaplex is now trying to get into skincare....Amyris is already number one there.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI hope that helps you all, and stay tuned for our next SeekingAlpha aritlcle and our associated stock talk planned for June 19th at 7pm CST (details for the talk can be found at facebook.com/IntheRuffResearch).\n\nFeel free to ask questions and put comments here, and I will make sure to respond. I periodically have the opportunity to talk with management and I do try to make sure to relay feedback, questions and comments I hear from Institutional and Retail investors.\n\nIn the meantime, Happy Investing,\n\nIRR",

I was drawn to Faded by Topicals for its powerhouse ingredients list and relatively low price (vs something like Skinceuticals Discoloration Defense), but I noticed that it says it should not be used with AHAs, BHAs, or retinols. However, it is recommended for daily use.\n\nMy issue is that my routine alternates nights between glycolic acid and 0.25% retinol. If this product can't be used in the same routine as either of those, I am stuck using it in the morning. But it has a STRONG scent, and I don't want to start my day smelling like sulfur, plus I prefer to do my active treatments at night -- mornings are very hectic around here and I need to keep my a.m. routine simple.\n\nLooking at the ingredient list (link to product and full ingredient list copied below), I don't know why it can't be used with AHAs, BHAs, or retinols, but I am not an expert so I thought I would see if anyone here does. Just wondering if it's not recommended because of the possibility of irritation, or if there are certain ingredients that inactivate each other or are harmful to combine.\n\nI've written to the company three times now asking these questions, and they haven't responded to any of my messages. Would be super grateful for any thoughts you all have!\n\nAnd if anyone out there with sun damage has a product they love, I would appreciate any recommendations.\n\nThank you!!!\n\nProduct link:\n\n[https://mytopicals.com/products/faded](https://mytopicals.com/products/faded)\n\nFull ingredient list:\n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Niacinamide, Tranexamic Acid, Shea Butter, Glyceral Stearate, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Ceteareth-12, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract, Behenyl Alcohol, Alpha-Arbutin, Jojoba Seed Oil, Zinc Ricinoleate, Azelaic Acid, Glutathione, Kojic Acid Dipalmitate, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanyl Palmitate, Allantoin, Phytic Acid, Squalane, Palm Butter, Glycine, Soybean Sterols, Cetyl Palmitate, Lecithin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Licorice Root Extract, Melatonin, Turmeric Root Extract, Sclerotium Gum, Arginine, Cocos Nucifera Oil, Bisabolol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\\*FYI: Faded contains exfoliating acids and niacinamide, and **may** cause some initial skin purging.

Plus if you are too use an already highly irritating ingredient like an exfoliating acid and seal it into your skin with something as occlusive (or is it emollient?) it would potentially be a recipe for disaster if used wrong on highly sensitive skin.\n\n *im not a derm this is just my two cents, read and follow the label or your dr's instructions! Not me! Lol \n\nI do realize this is a 2y.o post but this came up as the second result in my google search so im guessing it still gets really good traffic/visits. \n\n...how does a 2y.o reddit take second place (as in second best result?) on a search of \"can you use retinol and faded?\" I may get the randomest google results, makes me wonder how the algorythm works 😂🤔🧐",

Everything isn’t an exfoliating acid and can be used with Tret with discretion. It might irritate your face however if your skin isn’t used to Tret. You could sandwich them but putting a hydrating serum in-between them.",
