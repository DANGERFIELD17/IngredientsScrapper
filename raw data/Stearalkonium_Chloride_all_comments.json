    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application.

Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have a lot of problems with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

You might want to find a protein free conditioner to use and only use the protein one once every couple of weeks.\n\nAlso salt spray will just dry out your strands and make your hair feel coarse. I'm not sure why you are using salt spray if your straighten your hair. It's more likely to make it wavy and crazy.\n\nIf you use heat I'd maybe get a silicone heat spray/serum and just use it on the parts you straighten. Silicone WILL wash out if you don't use it in every single product and it will help to protect your hair from heat.\n\nWhen not using heat. Use an oil on your ends to keep them soft.\n\nHope that helps :)",

    "body": "The first three products of OG curly girl Lorraine Massey's brand [Curly World](https://www.curlyworld.com) are live now. There's a cleanser called \"Sham-Free Hair and Scalp Cleanser\" ($30 for 12oz.), a conditioner for all curl types called \"Terms and Conditions\" ($34 for 12 oz.) and a tone-correcting product for light-colored and grey hair called \"With or Without Hue\" ($36 for 12 oz.). I'm going to talk about the cleanser and the conditioner because I'm not very knowledgeable about tone correcting or color-treated hair. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nSHAM-FREE: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-7, Menthol, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nI do think the ingredients look very promising. The conditioner seems to be great for curly and very curly hair but from the look of the INCI might weigh wavy hair down? Thoughts?\n\nPRICE:\nThese products are pretty expensive. DevaCurl products are usually around $25 for 12 oz. I suppose this is understandable because this is a one-woman enterprise. However, what doesn't help is the...\n\nSHIPPING:\nCurrently, the shipping is $9~ via USPS. Which is really a bummer because it bumps up the price of the already expensive products. However, it looks like curl-friendly salons might start selling them? Which would be helpful to at least those of us who live close to one. Or maybe curly girls who live in the same area could split the shipping among themselves?\n\nPACKAGING:\nThese products come in a soft plastic bag with a nozzle. These look cute but I don't know how easy they would be to use in the shower. For that price, maybe there should have at least been bottles?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI have been following Massey's updates about her line and am enthusiastic about the products. Just looking at the INCI I can tell they are very well formulated. However, the price might be prohibitive for quite a few of us.",

    "body": "This is literally driving me crazy. I've more or less always had great hair, but in my 20's (I'm 26 now) I learned a routine that took care of it well. I'm not trying to boast or whatever, but every time I go to the salon I always get comments on the amazing condition of my hair. In the past four months or so for literally no reason, my hair is now *awful*.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have virgin waist length straight hair (fairly thick), I never do more than blowdry on low, or flat iron curl at 350 with heat protectant spray. I do a big cut once a year with trims in between. Before this happened, I was using Lush's honey I washed my hair shampoo bar with OGX's coconut milk conditioner and it was great. I wash every 3-5 days, only shampoo my scalp and roots where excess oils and product builds up and only condition the lengths of my hair. I'm not on birth control or any new medications. I live in a city with soft water, some of the best water quality in the world actually (Vancouver) and have lived here for five years. \n\nThe problem:\n\nI literally can barely get my fingers through my hair. It feels weighed down and film-y almost. I'm used to being able to go days without having to brush my hair, now it's like it's permanently tangled. It feels \"clean\" in the shower, but then it just sucks to manage as it gets dry. I can almost feel my hair tangling in the shower, it's like it's got no \"slip\" at all. I put in a golf ball size of conditioner every time. :/ My scalp is also a little more itchy than usual.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\nClarifying with dish soap to completely strip my hair\n\nCutting out **all** protein containing products for two months to eliminate possible protein overload\n\nNot washing my hair for two weeks to reset everything\n\nCo-washing only with protein free conditioner\n\n  \nNothing works, and I'm getting pretty upset about this. It's been four months and I just can't fix my hair! The only thing that changed was I moved to a new apartment in December, roughly around when the problem started. But like I said, hard water in my city just doesn't exist. Could there still be something wrong with the water in my building? I'm desperate enough to try washing my hair with bottled water to see if it helps.  \n\n\nI'm currently using Lush's Jason and the argan oil shampoo bar and Inecto Naturals argan oil conditioner. I still shampoo only my roots, and only every 3-5 days. I also use batiste dry shampoo between washes sometimes. Here's the ingredients for each:\n\nShampoo - Sodium Lauryl Sulfate , Agar Agar (Gelidium Cartilagineum) , Water (Aqua) , Argan Oil (Argania spinosa) , Glycerine , Fragrance , Rose Absolute (Rosa damascena) , Geranium Oil (Pelargonium graveolens) , Rose Oil (Rosa damascena) , Sicilian Lemon Oil (Citrus limonum) , \\*Limonene , Coumarin , Citronellol , Geraniol , Red 33 \n\nConditioner - Aqua, cetearyl alcohol, cetrimonium chloride, Stearalkonium chloride, argan spinosa (Argan), kernel oil, parfum, stearyl alcohol, isopropyl, sodium benzoate, citric acid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done hours of research, but I can't really find anything on my problem. I'm hoping someone here might have some insight because I don't know what to do at this point besides mourn my hair.",

Next time try a clarifying shampoo or even a tea tree oil shampoo. \nNot shampooing your hair won't help you either, that's allowing your hair to build up oils. \nIf you use sprays or waxes maybe eliminate them for awhile to prevent buildup. Only shampoo every second or third day. \n\nI'm gonna suggest getting a tea tree oil shampoo (I'm suggesting not drug store because the shampoos they sell are most like made of fillers like wax) and maybe some argan oil or a leave in conditioner to put only on the ends of your hair, away from the scalp. \n\nAlso consider getting a haircut soon, being able to feel and see your hair makes it easier to give advice. Researching on the internet is tricky bc a lot of the \"tips\" i see on instagram or those beauty blogs are often wrong about some things which is why i truly suggest talking to your hairdresser.",

It won't hurt your hair at all because it doesn't open your cuticle, like permanent and demi-permanent color processing does. [Here's info from labmuffin on different types of hair color that goes into more detail.](https://labmuffin.com/how-does-hair-dye-work/)\n\nLunar Tides' description is right that it's non-damaging — the ingredients indicate an intensive conditioner + color. That's it! So there's no need to wait to color or to use a second conditioner right before or after you apply the color. If you want deeper conditioning (and more intense color) just leave the Lunar Tides color on longer. (Careful though, the color can get pretty intense.)\n\nThe only thing to consider in terms of your hair's condition when applying the color is that you need to make sure you're applying it evenly, so lots of color coats ALL your hair, otherwise, you can get a patchy results. Lunar Tides' instructions will tell you to start with towel dried hair (so, slightly wet) and that helps with even application. You can also start with slightly wetter hair and leave the color on longer (I did this last time, it was fine).",

If your hair has mixed amount of damage (like roots are healthy but ends are fried) it might be a good idea to do a conditioning treatment first so that your hair all soaks up the dye evenly.

I eventually found Ology and tried it out- I hated it. I didn't feel clean and my hair felt heavy. After that, I learned about the no poo method and started washing my hair with baking soda. One time I ran out though, and forgot to make a new solution. I would have been late, so I just washed my hair with the Ology that was already in my shower. This time I LOVED it and I'm still using it. My hair is very shiny/soft and it feels light and clean. Plus, my shoulders don't break out!\n\nSo the common shampoos to Ology was a bad transition, but baking soda to Ology was great. I recommend trying it out.",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it’s definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 – 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don’t use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I’ve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life’s problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I’ve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn’t been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn’t feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I’m kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don’t have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I’m trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn’t help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it’s supposed to be “protective” according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn’t ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can’t verify (it cited the manufacturer’s website but I can’t find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can’t tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement. Thank you 🙏🏻🖤\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamide DIPA, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, PEG-16 Macadamia Glycerides, Polyquaternium 10, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Sodium Gluconate, Glucose, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**Malibu C Hard Water Conditioner:** Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Chloride, Olea Europaea Fruit Oil, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyquaternium-4, Linum Usitatissimum Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance/Parfum, Citric Acid, Cyclohexasiloxane, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool.\n\n**HealthySexyHair Conditioner:** Water (Aqua, Eau), Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Isopropyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-37, Lactic Acid, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/ Dicaprate, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Silicone Quaternium-22, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Hydroxy-ethylcellulose, Sodium PCA, Propylene Glycol, Quaternium-80, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone,Panthenol, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, C11-15 Pareth-7, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, C12-16 Pareth-9, Trideceth-12, Magnesium Nitrate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Palmitamidopro- pyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Magnesium Chloride, Trisodium HEDTA, Acacia Dealbata Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Moonstone Extract (lol), Fragrance (Parfum), Methylchloroisothiazolinone,Methylisothiazolinone, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Glyoxal, Sodium Nitrate, Limonene.",

    "body": "I have very thick/dense wavy hair (not fine or coarse, just lots of hair) and have been transitioning to co/low poo. None of my hair has ever been bleached, dyed, or chemically straightened, and I have used heat on it exactly once in the few years it's been since I shaved it all off. My scalp tends to be oily, and I get mild flakes which I've used T-Gel to combat for most of my life. \n\nMy current routine is a weekly shampoo with SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Shampoo, and daily/every-other day co-wash with either SE Strawberry or HE Freesia. Plop for 15-30 minutes (I get distracted), sometimes use some Raw Shea & Cupuaçu Frizz Defense Styling Gel-Cream when it's damp.\n\nI'm wondering what ingredients are different to make me enjoy using SE, and dislike using HE. I can't actually *see* any difference on the days I use one or the other (so I should probably use HE for a week or two and see if there's a visible difference) but the texture, slip, and feel of HE is much nicer in my hair. \n\nComparing the ingredients with the copy&paste website, SE has Propylene Glycol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol  as \"approved\". HE has Hydrolyzed Keratin, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, and Panthenol as \"approved with caution\" and Cetyl Alcohol and Stearyl Alcohol as \"approved\"\n\n\n\n. | Approved | Approved with caution\n---|---|----\nSuave Essentials | Cetyl Alcohol | Propylene Glycol\nHerbal Escapes | Cetyl Alcohol  | Propylene Glycol\n. | Stearyl Alcohol | Glycerin\n. | . | Hydrolyzed Keratin\n. | . | Panthenol\n\nSo, in an ideal world, this would mean that Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, or Panthenol are what is making the V05 feel icky. \n\nI have a feeling it isn't that simple.\n\nIf I could put this under a cut, I would, but this is V05 Herbal Escapes *Water (Aqua, EAU), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Stearate, DMDM Hydantoin, Linalool, Disodium EDTA, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Ext.

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.​ (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half, which is a life saver when you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a [Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.  The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it harder to grow and maintain your hair over time. \n\n**​Heat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Oréal](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx), their products are \"often formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:** found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer \n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation) \n* Polyquaternium-55 \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein \n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol \n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n​  \n**Oils and Silicones:** products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576°F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer \n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:** not found to prevent cuticle cracking \n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?* ](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

My ends feel dry and my scalp feels oily, probably because my scalp sweat a lot due to a very high density. It doesn't frizz, and is very limp and flat. I have a medium length hair.

I've kinda just accepted that my hair is awful. I just moved to another city and my nearest grocery store doesn't carry the shampoo I usually use, so I bought a new type. My hair now permanently feels heavy and fatty. I hate it. I never feel clean or fresh (and I barely used to with my old shampoo). So I definitely have learned that the shampoo/conditioner I use can influence my hair. That's what brought me here!\n\nI am about to finish university, and I am currently applying for jobs. I want to look fresh and cool and business-y, and I want to continue my life having the hair of my dreams. I know next to nothing about haircare. I learned a lot on this subreddit already, but since I have no clue where to even buy any product, and no idea how to choose which one, I have to ask: does anyone know about a good shampoo and/or conditioner that could suit my hair and that I can buy in Norway, or in a free shipping online store?\n\nAll help is appreciated!",

It is absolutely fixable, but it will take time. Something like 2-3 months. \n\nBefore I used Heads And Shoulders because I thought I had oily hair + dandruff. Nope. My scalp was just super dry because the shampoo was too harsh. I went days without washing it. I had it in a pony tail or bun all the time, even if it was really greasy. I washed it with conditioner every 2 weeks or so. Apply fuckloads, let it sit, wash it out. My hair + scalp are much better now. Now I only wash with conditioner (original Mane n Tail conditioner) maybe once every 5-7days. Every now and then I use a clarifying shampoo (also from Mane n Tail), if I need to look super fresh quickly, I use dry shampoo. \n\n\nSadly the products you get in store are quite shit here, and I doubt you will find any INT sites that ship to us with free shipping. I bought 1L bottle shampoo from iherb.com before they upped the postage, I now buy from www.lyko.no. www.blivakker.no is also a great site that is based here with free shipping, they have loads of brands.",

Wavies need less weight so you'll see less silicones. \n\nBut the way you asked using these examples is confusing. Both of these are products for curly hair. One is a conditioner and one is a styler.

    "body": "Does anyone know of a good conditioner with water-soluble silicones? For the past month or so I've tried cutting down on my use of silicones and sulfates (only use a sulfate shampoo once a week or so because my hair feels too gross without it), but overall my hair feels worse than before. About a month ago I bought some natures gate products, because I really like how they're relatively inexpensive and also vegan/cruelty free. \n\nFor anyone who's curious: \n\nThis is the ingredients list for the shampoo I've been using: Water, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, disodium cocoamphodiacetate, lauryl glucoside, glycerin, chamomilla recutita (matricaria) flower extract, panthenol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, borago officinalis (borage) seed oil, tocopherol, ascorbic acid, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, equisetum arvense (horsetail) leaf extract, geranium maculatum (geranium) extract, salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, mimosa tenuiflora (mimosa) bark extract, ascorbyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium hydroxide, phenoxyethanol, glyceryl undecylenate, citric acid, fragrance (parfum)*\nMade in the USA from globally sourced materials.\n* Phthalate free\nNo - sodium lauryl/laureth/coco sulfates, phthalates, butylene glycol, artificial colors.\n\nAnd this is the ingredients list for the conditioner - Water, Glycerin (Vegetable Derived), Stearyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Cetyl Alcohol (Vegetable Derived), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Vegetable Derived), Benzyl Alcohol, Stearalkonium Chloride (Vegetable Derived), Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice, Hordeum Vulgare (Barley) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Viola Tricolor (Pansy) Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hydroxyethylcellulose (Plant Derived), Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance*.\n*Phthalate free.\n\nMy hair feels straw-like even in the shower, there's no slip unless it's absolutely coated in conditioner and then as soon as it rinses out it feels gross again. I also feel like my hair is falling out more often (if I pull at the tips, long strands will start coming out in the shower). I don't really know what to do. I feel like my hair gets buildup pretty easily because when I've tried cowashing with thick shampoos or have put oil in my hair it always feels really weighed down and greasy the next day. I also have some issues with an itchy, flaky scalp. \n\nI was thinking that using a conditioner with water soluble silicones would be the best compromise - all the benefits of silicones but without the buildup. \n\nDoes anyone have any product recommendations? *I've also been looking for a heat protectant spray* that contains water soluble silicones, since I usually straighten my hair a bit to get rid of the really weirdly shaped waves. I've started using a bit of salt spray in my hair as well (not that often), but I feel like it's been drying out my ends. I considered mixing a bit of conditioner or oil (I've heard jojoba is closest to the scalp sebum) into the mix to make it less damaging, but I have no idea what the salt is doing to my hair with or without silicones. On one hand, it seems like silicones would protect my hair from the salt penetrating it too much. But on the other, it would also prevent the moisturizing ingredients from penetrating my hair, so it seems like a catch-22. I do think I need silicones though, because my hair just doesn't seem to be doing too great without them.   \n\nI'm sorry for such a long post! But if anyone could help me, that would be wonderful.

Hair is made of protein and protein can help with curl structure and strength (again read the blog post). The recommendation I’ve seen is people with low porosity hair can have a little protein in one or two products or do a protein treatment once a month. Best practice is to try adding a little protein to your routine and try it once or twice to see how your hair reacts then switch off to a non-protein product for a few washes to see how your hair reacts. My hair is low porosity and fine and I currently use protein in my deep conditioner and gel and it is a little too much on the protein side of the protein-moisture balance. So I bought a moisture-only deep conditioner and for a few weeks I’m going to see if alternating my protein DC and my new moisture DC will help balance my hair.\n\n*exceptions if your hair is protein sensitive \n\nMy advice: if your budget allows get two deep conditioners (one with protein, one with moisture) or look for samples and travel sizes to try out a few DCs without committing to a whole tub of product. \n\nOne cautionary note: if you go with your second deep conditioner, it has glycerin high on its list. Glycerin works best in a certain temperant range of temperature, so if you are in a location that is has cold, dry air right now that product could cause frizz depending on your routine.",

Would there be something I could get him that might make his experience better?\n\nAnd of course what would be a good shaving lotion or soap I could order online for him that has no coconut? \n\nIf you are unsure some of the lesser common names of coconut I found a handy list I've used every time I buy him stuff I keep handy on my phone:\n \n* 1,2 Octanediol\n* 2 Phenoxyethanol\n* Ammonium Lauryl Sulphate\n* Capryl Glycol\n* Caprylic Acid\n* Caprylic Glycol\n* Caprylic/Capric\n* Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides\n* Caprylyl Glycol\n* Ceteareth-20\n* Cetearyl Alcohol\n* Cetearyl Glucoside\n* Ceteth-20 Phosphate\n* Cetyl Alcohol\n* Cetyl Esters\n* Cocamide MEA\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine\n* Cococaprylate/Caprate\n* Coco Glucoside\n* Cocomide DEA\n* Coconut diethanolamide (CDFA)\n* Cocos nucifera (another name for coconut oil)\n* Coconut Oil\n* Decyl Glucoside\n* Disodium Cocamphodiprop\n* Disodium cocoamphodiacetate\n* Emusifying Wax\n* Glyceryl Caprylate\n* Glyceryl cocoate\n* Hexyl Laurate\n* Isopropyl Myristate\n* Laureth-3\n* Lauric Acid\n* Lauryl Glucoside\n* Lauryl Alcohol\n* Lauramide DEA\n* Myristic Acid\n* Olefin Sulfonate\n* Organic Sodium Cocoate\n* PEG - 7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* PEG -100\n* PEG – 100 Stearate\n* Phenoxyethanol\n* Polysorbate 20\n* Sodium Cocoate\n* Sodium Coco-Sulfate\n* Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate\n* Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate\n* Sucrose Stearate\n* Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n* Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinat\n* Sodium Lauryl Sulfate\n* Sodium Stearate\n* Sorbitan Stearate\n* Stearyl Alcohol\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Sucrose Cocoate\n* TEA-Laureth Sulfate\n* Vegetable Cetearyl Glucose\n* Vegetable Glycerine (depends on source)\n\nAs you might imagine it's really hard to buy him stuff sometimes. -_-",

The copy on the website page makes reference to \"three plant-based surfactants\" that foam up, which are not present at all in that ingredient list.\n\nb) accurate, and therefore not really a shampoo.  If that list *is* correct, then the product is almost all oils and contains no cleansers.  That would explain the why your hair doesn't look good: it's not getting clean.\n\nI think (a) is more likely based on the \"plant-based surfactants\" line.  What does your actual bottle say?
