    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!!

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it.

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I’ve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

Only experience will tell how it works in your hair\"\n\n\"That particular silicone is designed to attach to damaged areas in your hair - little chipped cuticle edges, broken cuticles. It doesn't prevent moisture from entering the hair strands. It acts like a conditioning ingredient. It will wash out with almost any detergent. The only detergent that does not remove it very well is Decyl glucoside or Lauryl glucoside - and that only applies when one of those is the *only* detergent in a shampoo\"\n\n-Science-y hair blog.\n\nMeaning, in theory you won't be experiencing buildup but also get the silicone effect. This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

It's been a month now and OP, I can't thank you enough for your post. \n\nI have 2B curls with fine hair and it was damaged (bleaching, color, heat treatment 😭) before I started CGM. I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

    "body": "A quick review right before I shower HAHAHA.\n\nInfo:\nI have combination skin leaning towards oily. My skin is acne and clog prone and I do have some KP on my bottom cheeks/jaws. My skin is also a sensitive and moody chicken if anyone’s wondering so I’m super picky about the products I use. \n\n\nRoutine:\n\nAM: Splash with water -> Vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> some sunscreen sample lol\nPM: Dokdo cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline\n\n\nThis cleanser had a very creamy and sticky texture. It foams a little when you rub your hands together with water. As the whole line is targeted towards sensitive skin, it is a very gentle cleanser.\n\n\nThoughts:\n\nOkay I actually didn’t really expect much from this product when I first used it. It was a huge impulse buy and I actually regretted buying it. Prior to using this cleanser, I was using the Rovectin Conditioning Cleanser and let’s just say that it was one big roller coaster haha. I switched over to this cleanser in hopes to save my skin and also because it was just collecting dust on my desk lol.\n\nThe texture is sooooo fun to play with. Even though it’s creamy, it’s also rather sticky. It’s nothing like the other cleansers I’ve tried before. It doesn’t foam up too much so my skin doesn’t feel stripped.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have any added fragrances, it does have a smell. Personally to me it smells like someone threw up in it, but some people say it smells herbal like or plastic like or mineral like. Yeah lots of different smells LOL. I thought I had bought a fake so I went and bought another cleanser (travel version) from the official store and it smells the same so rip ;-;. \n\nIt’s a no nonsense kind of cleanser, does what it needs to do and does it well. It doesn’t remove makeup that well because it’s quite gentle, so you might need a first cleanser for that. For sunscreen it depends, but I’ve heard some people just cleanse their face twice with the cleanser just to be safe. \n\nCompared to the previous cleanser I used, this one was so nice to use. It made me feel so excited to shower LOL. I didn’t get any reactions from this and in fact, some of my CCs and pimples actually went down when I started using this. \n\nIs this HG? I guess it is. I’m genuinely hesitant to call something a HG because I’m scared that my skin will go no u on me. But I guess at this moment? It is close to being one. I bought mine off of SHOPEE and it cost about SGD$18-$20+ with discount. I think the original price is about $30? I might actually repurchase this once I’m done HAHAHA.  9/10\n\nRoundlab is also well known for their Dokdo toner and I’m really tempted to try it LOL. But I have my pyunkangyul essence toner coming in soon for me to try so ummmm one day one day. My friend actually bought it and said that it’s such a good toner.",

    "body": "Ive been searching for a replacement for a good cleanser for my dry-dehydrated-sensitive skin. I thought I found my HG cleanser this year with the B Lab Matcha Cleanser which left my skin clean but soft. I fell in love just from trying a free sample from Stylevana. Unfortunately B Lab changed the formula and packaging for this cleanser. I bought the new version and hated it. It was dry and stripping like the Senka whip cleanser. \n\nSo I went through some suggestions from this sub and made a list. I was browsing a local shop today and saw the Round Lab Dokko cleanser for $11 for 150 ml and bought it. Beauty of Josean Green Plum cleanser was also on my to try list but it was $12 for 100 ml so I went with the Round Lab just cuz of the better price per ml.\n\nOverall rating: 4/5\n\nScent: mild soapy scent. Nothing offensive. Barely noticeable. \n\nI latered a dollop in my hands with water then washed my face and rinsed with water. It doesnt really foam up. It cleaned off my skincare, Etude eyebrow pencil, Lilybyred blush, Romand water tint, and Stila eyeliner well.\n\nMy skin didnt fee taut/tight. The cleanser didnt leave a weird filmy layer either. It was just my skin but clean. Its light but I wouldn’t call it hydrating — probably because of my dry skin. Best of all, no irritation. \n\n It didnt feel as soft as the og B Lab matcha cleanser though. I might explore other options after I use up this Round Lab one, but this is going to be my fallback cleanser from now on as long as the formula didnt change. \n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Saccharide Hydrolysate, Disodium EDTA, Pullulan, 1,2-Hexanediol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Sea Water, Sodium Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylic/​Capric Triglycerides, Beta-Glucan, Phosphatidylcholine, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide NP, Glycine, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Serine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lysine, Alanine, Arginine, Threonine, Proline",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

        "body": "I didn’t have a severe case and it largely consisted of redness and small closed comedones with some inflamed ones. I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

Putting down all the reviews at one place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21mqpuxa4p7c1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6152cd7496bcfdc6354819d50cab1872dd769b28\n\n**About me**: 25 F; I have combination skin with an oily T zone in summers and dry cheeks and nose in winters. I don't like strong fragrance in products, and I stay away from DIYs\n\n**Skin concerns**: Cystic acne; scars, hyperpigmentation *and* *crying* from the cystic acne\n\nAccording to the brand, All CeraVe products are formulated to be fragrance-free.\n\n*Category 1: Cleansers*\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cream-to-Foam Cleanser**\n\nTexture: Just like its described. It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**. Already on 6th bottle. **WRP Forever**.\n\nIngredients AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, COCO-BETAINE, SODIUM COCOYL ISETHIONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PCA, PPG-5-CETETH-20, PEG-100 STEARATE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, PEG-6 CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC GLYCERIDES, PEG-30 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE, CI 77891 / TITANIUM DIOXIDE, ASPARTIC ACID, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, CARBOMER, GLYCOL DISTEARATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, GLYCERYL OLEATE, GLYCINE, TRIDECETH-6, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, THREONINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, ARGININE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SERINE, SODIUM BENZOATE, VALINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, PROLINE, ISOLEUCINE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALANINE, PHENYLALANINE, COCONUT ACID, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, CHLORPHENESIN, DISODIUM EDTA, HYDROXYETHYL UREA, CITRIC ACID, HYDROXYETHYL ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, HISTIDINE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, POLYQUATERNIUM-53, POLYQUATERNIUM-39, POLYSORBATE 60, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n**CeraVe** **Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser (4% Benzyl Peroxide)**\n\nTexture: Translucent lotion-y texture, It’s runnier than the Cream to foam cleanser. Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**. I cut one point for the packaging; It leaked on a flight once. **WRP**\n\nIngredients BENZOYL PEROXIDE 4%\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENTS: WATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, SODIUM C14-16 OLEFIN SULFONATE, XANTHAN GUM, POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, NIACINAMIDE, GLYCOLIC ACID, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM CITRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, PROPANEDIOL, CITRIC ACID, TETRASODIUM EDTA, DIETHYLHEXYL SODIUM SULFOSUCCINATE, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZOIC ACID\n\n*Category 2: Serum*\n\n**CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum**\n\nTexture: Off-white runny lotion texture. Spreads easily. Not sticky, layers well under other products in my routine. No added fragrance.\n\nApplication: I started with using it twice a week and built up to every day. I use the sandwich method and layer between essence and a moisturizer. I don’t like it. It didn’t do anything for me. I noticed no difference in my skin except a slight smoothing effect. I find it to be a non-offensive beginner retinol.\n\n**5/10**. Excellent packaging. All Retinol products should come in a pump like this. **WNRP**\n\nIngredients: AQUA/WATER/EAU, PROPANEDIOL, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARYL ETHYLHEXANOATE, NIACINAMIDE, AMMONIUM POLYACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE, DIPOTASSIUM GLYCYRRHIZATE, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, DIMETHICONOL, LECITHIN, SODIUM CITRATE, RETINOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, ALCOHOL, ISOPROPYL MYRISTATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n*Category 3: Moisturizers*\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturising Lotion**\n\nTexture: Super light gel cream texture. Applies like a dream on my skin. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I apply it after Hada Labo lotion. Used it throughout summer, great stand alone moisturizer. It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

BoJ left my skin hydrated actually. While Skin1004 is a cream foam cleanser. It is a basic foam cleanser but made my skin smoother and fresh. It didn’t feel tight, but it feels like it’s going to be drying if I don’t immediately follow up with a toner. Other than that, I think it’s also a great cleanser especially for double cleanse. I think BoJ is more suitable to dry skin than Skin1004 in my opinion. I have combination skin which gets combo dry during winter and combo oily in summer.",

    "body": "This is such a simple, no-nonsense, multipurpose product. It is an accidental find but has found a permanent place in my skincare/haircare drawer. The product does not have a strong fragrance which does not linger after washing. The cost effectiveness is mind blowing for its uses. I got the 100ml bottle for 85/- but definitely going to invest in the 500ml henceforth. \n\nComing to its uses : \n\nSkincare - \nThis is such a great, gentle cleanser. I can safely use this as a morning cleanse for summers. In winters, I used the creamy cleansers like Cetaphil, Cleanseme. But as the weather is changing, I am stocking up on my gel cleansers and this one definitely tops the list. It has a refreshing baby product scent which is a great pick me up! Further, it does not leave your skin feeling dry or tight. \n\nHaircare - \nThis is such an amazing mild shampoo! I was flabbergasted! The days I don’t oil my hair, I can safely place my bet on washing my hair with this and not being afraid of my hair drying out. I’ve an entire shampoo stash that I love but I am more than happy having this as a backup shampoo for the days when I don’t want to do anything other than shampoo and condition. It is also a good hair cleanser to use after herbal powders. ( I add oils to my herbal powders so I need a gentle cleanse post it.) \n\nBody care - \nI think this is a no-brainer. It is a simple, not-too-foaming body wash. It does the job. If you like something stronger or more fragranced for the body then this is not the one. But, it’s great if you want something gentler. I have noticed that my body does not feel stretchy or dry after taking a shower the days I used this in place of my traditional body wash or soap. \n\nIngredient : Water*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin*, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PPG-2 Hydroxyethyl Cocamide*, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate*, Sodium Benzoate, Decyl Glucoside*, Citric Acid*, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nAvailability : This can be found legit everywhere. Online and Offline Stores.\n\nBottom line : This Top to Toe product is for all the Babies out there ( including us!)",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "#👻 Review type: \n\nJust... good 😂 A nice, non-stripping cleanser. \n\n4.5/5\n\nDocking half a point for unrealistic brand claims, and nitpicking about the label, that's all.\n\nWRP, but maybe not immediately - I'd like to try something new. Maybe even the Rejusure 2% Salicylic Face wash again, only using it every day this time 🤔\n\n\n👽 **Skin type:** Oily\n\nSensitive, malassezia (fungal acne) - prone, PIE/PIH-prone, mildly acne-prone\n\n🤡 **Climate:** Usually hot and humid\n\nThis face wash lasted me through monsoon, which was slightly cooler.\n\n👹 **Age:** 30\n\n🤖 **Usage timeline:** Since June, so four and a half months (I have one last use left). Used once a day, at night.\n\n#👻 Ingredient list\nAqua, Cocoamidopropyl betaine, Sodium Methyl 2-Sulfolaurate, Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Chamomilla Recutita extract, Aloe Barbadensis extract, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside , Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Niacinamide, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Salicylic Acid, Betaine, Sodium Gluconate.\n\n🦇 **Price:** ₹299 for 100ml. \n\nUsually available for around 250 bucks. It woulda lasted me around two months if I used it morning and night, so I'd consider it okay value for money.\n\nI will say, I expected the bottle to be much larger, because of the scale of the print on the label 😂 I was VERY surprised when I got it and it was... small. That's one reason I added a photo of the bottle (which is otherwise very nice, sturdy and practical). I have quite small hands! That text is a bit disproportionate, IMO, and makes the online photos slightly misleading. \n\n[Images of bottle, texture, foam, pH strip of around 5.5](https://imgur.com/a/Mc3RvVu)\n\n#👻 User experience\n\nA clear, thickish consistency. Pretty much your usual face wash. It lathers up, but depends on the amount you use - how much I used in the texture shot lathered a LOT, and was too much for one use 🙃 The bubbles are just because it's on its last legs, otherwise it's just an unremarkable, clear gel. \n\nIt makes a soft, fine lather - not as bubbly or as foamy as an old-school foaming face wash. Pleasurable enough to use. Non-stripping, but cleanses effectively. It lathers a bit less when I use it to double cleanse, after a cleansing balm. \n\nThe pH, as you can see, is around 5.5. Points for that 🙌🏼 So it's pH-balanced.\n\n#👻 My thoughts\n\nI'd recommend this cleanser to anyone with oily/sensitive skin, but I wouldn't expect it to have any particular benefits, besides giving a good cleanse. The brand claims:\n\n>Salicylic acid and Niacinamide work together to unclog pores, control sebum production, and prevent comedones. This light yet effective gel salicylic acid face wash removes dirt and impurities, cleans pores, reduces blackheads and reveals softer skin\n\nI cannot say I've noticed my skin being less oily at all 🤷🏽‍♀️ Or taking longer to get oily. Like, what foaming face wash doesn't degrease? They all do. Didn't do shit for blackheads, either. Didn't expect it to 😂\n\nWouldn't recommend for dry skin, because despite the surfactants being quite gentle, there's enough of them in there that it can leave your skin feeling a bit squeaky if you use a little extra... which, as an oily-skinned person, it's the exact level of cleansing strength I prefer in a face wash ☺️ \n\nHope that was helpful!

I was wondering if there was a cheaper shampoo out there that had similar ingredients/properties/etc. I know that it contains a \"patented Healthy Hair Molecule (OFPMA)\" so it may be difficult to find something close enough. \n\n**Some Background Info:**\n\nI have fine/thin shoulder length virgin (undyed) hair. I don't use any styling products or tools. I typically shampoo every two days, air dry, detangle with a wide tooth comb when dry, and wear up in a loose messy bun most of the time. I don't use conditioner.\n\nMy current apartment has very hard water, and I don't have the option of installing a water softener or anything like that. \n\nSulfate free or low sulfate shampoos don't clean my scap well enough, and shampoos with SLS or SLES tend to irritate my scalp and cause increased hair fallout. \n\nLiving Proof shampoo is the only one I've found that cleans well, does not strip or dry my hair, and leaves my scalp happy. It's just lovely silky hair and a balanced scalp. I am not knowledgeable enough, however, to figure out why!\n\n**The ingredients list is here:** \n\n*Water/Eau/Aqua, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Octafluoropentyl Methacrylate (OFPMA), PCA Glyceryl Oleate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-150 Pentaerithrityl Tetrastearate, IPDI/PEG-15 Soyamine Copolymer Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleammonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-47, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance/Parfum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Magnesium Nitrate, Magnesium Chloride.*",

I think my top budget recommendations would be either Batiste or Dove Beauty.\n\nIf you're interested in attempting to DIY it, I've also used cornstarch with cinnamon and cocoa added (for color since I'm a brunette) and it works super well. It might leave more build up on your scalp than you want, but on days when I know I'm stretching it but don't want to wash, it gets rid of oiliness incredibly well and leaves my hair feeling pretty clean.",

Continuing the cream series, this review features Nivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear ([https://www.nivea.com.br/produtos/nivea-men-sensitive-creme-de-barbear-2-em-1-40059003284720033.html](https://www.nivea.com.br/produtos/nivea-men-sensitive-creme-de-barbear-2-em-1-40059003284720033.html)) brought to me by an awesome “Instagramer” @bayareashaves. In truth, this gift was the inspiration behind the entire cream series. Please give him a follow and check out Nivea’s expansive line of skincare products. This cream comes in a 65g polymer tube and retails for R$ 7,99. \n\nAs with most mass produced products, things like scent notes are rarely provided. The Nivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear smells very clean and fresh with a touch of zest to it. The scent is light to mid in strength and washes away quickly after the shave making it multi occasion approved and also multi seasonal. It is great to use and then apply your desire post shave product and/or frag without fear of interference from a lingering scent.\n\nNivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear is made from: Aqua, Glycerin, Myristic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-8, Alba Wax, Parfum, Maris Sal, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Oleic Acid, Maltodextrin, Acrylates Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Arachidic Acid, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Trisodium EDTA. Using about an almond size amount will yield enough lather for a three pass shave. Using a damp but not soaking wet brush and the slow addition of water will make plenty of lather which will look like sour cream. The primary slickness of this cream is very good and the residual slickness is good. I took care to not overbuff without visible lather present. Post shave is below average as compared to the huge artisan soap market bases. A post shave product feels like a must when using this cream. Given my experience with this cream, the ShaveScore for is a 75. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Nivea Men Sensitive Creme De Barbear (gift)\n* Brush - Mocek \"Green Tea\" (purchased)\n* Razor - Blackland Razors Vector (gift) \n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)  \n ",

    "body": "Hey guys. Balea MED Ultra Sensitive Waschgel is a very famous product among people who has very sensitive and dry skin. They all swore that this product is their holy grail and a must in their routine. I have a **combination-oily acne prone skin, suffered fungal acne** and still is, but decided to give this product a try. The product is gel-textured and really nice on your skin. It has no fragrance, which is essential in my everyday routine. It should left my skin hydrated but unfortunately this product does not agree with my skin. My skin doesn't like it very much because somehow after rinsing off the cleanser, my skin feels a bit tight and a bit itchy. I believe this is due to the ingredients in the product that can aggravate fungal acne.\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAQUA, GLYCERIN, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, METHYLPROPANEDIOL, SODIUM ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SODIUM CHLORIDE, PANTHENOL, BISABOLOL, SODIUM COCOAMPHOACETATE, POLYGLYCERYL-4 CAPRATE, COCO-GLUCOSIDE, **~~GLYCERYL OLEATE~~**, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, **~~SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE~~**, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, CITRIC ACID, **~~HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE~~**, TOCOPHEROL.\n\nThe bolded and strikedthrough ingredients may be the culprit behind the aggravation of fungal acne. Until now I can't stop scratching cheeks and forehead lightly. URGH\n\nThese are my honest review, like always you guys should take it with a grain of salt. I'm not against this product, it's just that my skin hates it.\n\nDifferent people have different reaction to different products. Find one that suits you.\n\nIf you still haven't found your holy grail, don't worry. Be thankful for the journey of finding them, because you will learn a lot, not only about which ingredient is good or bad, but also discovering about yourself and building your mental strength :)\n\n(No worries tho, I've given the cleanser to my boyfriend who has combination dry skin, and his skin is loving it, so it's a win-win situation here)",

I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

    "body": "To preface, I have dry skin and had heard good things about the Missha cleansing milk (this is not that product). I picked up this cleanser (around $10-11, on sale) because I couldn't find the cleansing milk at my local Missha store. Apparently they had run out so I decided to try my luck at what I hoped to be a similar product. I did look up the ingredients before buying since my skin is susceptible to a burning sensation when it doesn't like things. \n\nHere is the list: \nWater, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Nymphaea Coerulea Flower Extract, Lauramide DEA, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Acrylate Coploymer, Polyquaternium-7, Capylyl Glycol, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Hexylene Glycol, PEG-90M, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Buthoxy Diglycol, Glycereth-26, Diglycerin, Diethoxy Diglycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nSo I've been using this since December and am almost out. I used to only use this during the PM but started using this both morning and night to wash away the eye goo and stuff (lolew?). I normally lather it up before I apply it to my face. \n\nThe product does claim to be a one step type of product - the kind that can remove your make up. I didn't really use it this way so I'm unsure how well it functions as one. I will say that I did use it a few times to remove my every day make up but I don't wear a lot of makeup to begin with - mascara, light eyeshadow, bbcream and light blush at most (mascara always). However, it DID remove all of that makeup when I tried to use it as a one step. So for lazy, light make up days I think it works. Of course, it worked just fine as a second cleanser. \n\nThe cleanser didn't burn my skin while in use nor did it feel stripping or drying or tight when I finished cleansing. It didn't have that \"clean\" feeling that ordinary soaps give but it felt like my face...was my face, if that makes sense. It felt like the whole day had been washed away but all the natural oils hadn't. I didn't even feel the need to rush to put on my toner when I get out of the shower, which is where I cleanse my face. I'm unsure what the ph is though, unfortunately, so I apologize since many people look for that in reviews. \n\nThere is a fragrance that goes away after you wash. The strength was that of a normal shampoo, I think. However if you're super sensitive to fragrances, this may not be for you. \n\nAnyway, I think I'd rate this a 4/5 only because it's not an HG right now. I would definitely repurchase this, but I'm still experimenting with cleansers so I can't say it's HG status just yet. It does its job without making my skin cranky! I also like that it's available at my local store lol. \n\nTLDR: It's a foamy milk cleanser, does agree with my dry, sensitive, hates the world skin. Not super drying, not super stripping and would RP. PH level currently unknown. \n\n",

It’s a creamy kaolin/bentonite based cleanser that also includes another gentle surfactant.  It foams very lightly, but much of it stays creamy.  What I like is that before these three ingredients glycerin appears (as bolded above), so I don’t find it harsh in the least.  If the surfactants appeared before the glycerin it would likely be more stripping, so I appreciate that they decided to make a gentler formula.  It does have salicylic acid and glycolic acid, though I seriously doubt there is enough of either to do much of anything.  After using it, my combo/oily skin (yay summer) was clean but not stripped, and my forehead wasn’t red/irritated, which has been a problem for me in the past (that’s what CeraVe Foaming Cleanser did, along with stripping my skin in general).  Its pH is nice and low, and it can also be used as a face mask, so those on a tighter budget who want a decent cleanser and a face mask can try this out without breaking the bank.  \n\n\nThis cleanser would be a solid 5/5 if it didn’t have fragrance.  I would give it a 4.5/5 if it had fragrance BUT there wasn’t a cooling effect, which isn’t really that strong, but I’ve come to associate cooling effects from skin care products with irritation, so I cannot give it higher than a 4/5.  It’s not particularly strong, but I can’t say I would call it “mild,” either.  \n\nWould I repurchase:  Possibly, though I want to try the Pixi Glow Mud Cleanser and a DYI honey/clay/oil cleanser before I make my final decision.  \n\n**FINAL SCORE** 4/5\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions….\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You see…this Cleanser saved my life…\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or don’t) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an “all-natural” Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOL…over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming up…but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Maker…WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formula…there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didn’t have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils aside…this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxurious…and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a “basic” Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brightening…something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said “I’m just gonna pop in here and fix this.” and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my “In Case Of Emergency…Use This” Cleanser. For those that aren’t particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)…this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bm67gdhtjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=451d64d229f10607a1c6d82b5ef104d11f6adfdb",

So I tried First Aid Beauty cleanser and their ultra repair cream and omg, what a relief. Really excellent stuff. A little of the cleanser goes a long way. \n\nI currently use Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser which doesn’t dry out my skin. Love it and just like with the FAB cleanser, a little goes a long way. I bought the 2.5 oz tube in late July and am only now about to finish it up. It’s amazing. \n\nFresh Soy Cleanser was also really gentle and soothing to use and didn’t leave my face feeling tight or dry. I wish it weren’t so expensive.

I've been reading and researching about it but got even more confused so I thought I'd ask here lol.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I decided to get one and my hairdresser told me not to use anything containing salt (but said nothing about sulfates, or i might have missed it lol). So, I got the Loreal Eversleek shampoo because its advertised as specifically made and a safe shampoo for keratin treated hair. After I got home I started reading the ingredient list and to my surprise, sodium chloride is listed as an ingredient! So I guess what im asking is if its safe to use? Has anyone tried it? Will it strip off the treatment out of my hair? I dont really get the \\~science\\~ behind it and the differences between using sodium and salts and sulfates.   \nI also have been using a sodium free but not sulfate free shampoo, and I dont really like it so I wanna know if this is safe and worth giving a shot. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: AQUA / WATER / EAU  \nSODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE  \nLAURETH-5 CARBOXYLIC ACID  \n**SODIUM CHLORIDE**  \nCOCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  \nGLYCERIN  \nPEG-150 DISTEARATE  \nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE  \nCOCONUT ACID  \nSODIUM BENZOATE  \nSODIUM LAUROYL GLUTAMATE  \nPOLYQUATERNIUM-10  \nSALICYLIC ACID  \nHEXYL CINNAMAL  \nLINALOOL  \nBENZYL SALICYLATE  \nBENZYL ALCOHOL  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT / SUNFLOWER SEED EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRONELLOL  \nSODIUM HYDROXIDE  \nLACTIC ACID FIL CODE D55635/1\n\nAlso I think is worth mentioning Im from a little country located in South America, so my access to hair products is very limited, and the ones that we have are super overpriced compared to the states.\n\nThank you so much in advance !",

My stylist has always told me to use sulfate-free products and to avoid anything (including styling products)  that has sodium chloride in the ingredient list. IIRC it has something to do with sodium chloride effectively stripping the keratin out of your hair and being abrasive. She explained it to me like this (I'm paraphrasing): You know how when you go swimming in the ocean (or gulf or whatever salt-water body of choice) and your wet hair dries its a little bit crunchy and clumpy? That's from the salt. \n\nScience time: Sulfates are derived from sulfuric acid. They are in a wide range of products, but their primary application is as a lathering or cleansing agent. You know how shampoos that have sulfates lather really really well and sulfate-free ones don't? That's why. Sulfate's purpose in this universe is to clean things and its really good at it. For a person with non-damaged, non-chemically treated a shampoo with sulfates is probably fine. \n\nHowever, for anyone with a compromised cuticle (the outer part of the hair strand; this includes anyone with color or chemical treatment) sulfates are sketchy because they're *too*  good at their job. Most clarifying shampoos just have a lot of sulfates in them.\n\nBottom Line: Your hair isn't gonna fall out or melt off and using the shampoo won't completely strip your treatment out all at once. But sulfates and sodium chloride will decrease the longevity of your treatment. Probably by 25-50%, depending on how frequently you wash your hair.\n\nNB: someone please fact-check my science, chemistry was a reeeaaaaallllly long time ago.",

Now, I've only ever used their aloe gel, and that's fragrance and everything else free, basically. \n\nThe face washes appear gentle enough, sulphate-free, etc., but they do contain fragrance, at what seems to be varying concentrations - the Aqua Wave variant has actual menthol crystals in the ingredient list, the Balinese Mango one has fragrance *and* mango extract listed above phenoxyethanol, and the Wild Strawberry variant contains strawberry extract beads. Whatever that means 🤔 Those are a  straight no. \n\nOn the flip side, their base formula seems nice and basic:\n\n>purified water, cocamidopropyl betaine, glycerine (vegetable derived), caprylic/ capric glucoside, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, acrylates copolymer, sodium PCA, ethylene glycol monostearate, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, fragrance, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e) and disodium edta.\n\nThat's the ingredients list for the hyaluronic acid variant, that... does not include hyaluronic acid? 😅\n\nThis one, the tea tree one and the vitamin C one seem okay types... \n\nWhat do y'all think? Should I just be buying something less sketchy? I admit, the \"flavoured\" shit approach is what makes me nervous - it makes me wonder if the fragrance is strong.\n\nHas anyone here used one of the Body Cupid cleansers? \n\n... And of course, if y'all know of any other fungal-safe cleanser options, I'd love to hear 'em! My trusted standby and morning single cleanse is micellar water in a foaming pump, but... gotta have one gentle, bland regular cleanser, ya know? I'm not sure micellar foam gets oil cleanser off well enough 🤔 It's meant to be used on dry skin, not wet... \n\nThe other ones I'm considering are the Deconstruct cleansers (either the hyaluronic or niacinamide one) , the Kaya Soothing Gel cleanser and the Sebamed foaming one (I know u/oyasumipizza didn't enjoy that one!), and I'd appreciate input about those, too, if you have any ☺ The Deconstruct hyaluronic one is pulling ahead in my mind RN. \n\n\nK, thnx, byeee! ❤",

It gently exfoliates dead skin, and is very effective at minimising acne and blackheads, all the while hydrating your skin just the right amount. Best part is that it never irritates your skin, even when using actives or tret. \n\nThe thing about the foam is that it needs to be used in a particular way for maximum efficacy - you need to take 1-2 pumps of the foam and spread it well over dry (or at best, mildly damp) skin, massage it in for a bit and leave on for 3-5 minutes. If you use it like a regular face wash, it will not do much. \n\nWhen I'm in the mood for something a bit more exfoliating (1-2 times a week), I use a glycolic/salicylic acid based face wash instead of my Sebamed foam. My current favourite is Glomed C - I bought this because it allegedly has 5% glycolic acid, but the percentage is not really mentioned anywhere on the packaging. This one leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling exfoliated/smoother, without stripping it of hydration, and I personally really like it for my limited purposes.",

Sodium cocoyl glutamate seems to be tolerable but it doesn't clean as well\n\nSun Bum daily cleanser and Kitsch tea tree mint shampoo bar are totally safe for my eyes and skin; I don't get eyelid eczema or dermatitis from them at all. These have sodium cocoyl isethionate and sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, none of the other surfactants\n\nYour skin may react to ingredients differently from mine, however I've read that allergies to cocamidopropyl betaine and glucosides are quite common. So I suggest avoiding cleansers, shampoo, soaps that have those ingredients if you have eyelid issues. And yes, I tried petroleum jelly, different lotions, creams, moisturizers on my eyelids - none of that worked for me. I still had eyelid eczema. Only avoiding irritating surfactants has worked to let my skin heal\n\nHope this helps!",

Only used the Protopic for a week to reduce the redness and swelling which it did and made my skin look nearly normal. I got rid of all products that I checked to contain Cocomidopropyl Betaine however the eczema/dermatitis has returned. \n\nI’ve now been prescribed all the steroid and Protopic treatments available however I am very reluctant to use them as they just mask the problem when I need to prevent it.\n\nBased on your post the soap I’m using did contain cococate, albeit sodium, not sucrose. (If that matters?)\n\nI’m literally the blandest of guys. Don’t use anything obvious apart from soap. Checked washing detergent and conditioner which all seem to be fine.\n\nI’ve just ordered the Kitsch product and another brand which doesn’t contain any of the above ingredients you’ve listed so hopefully it’ll have a positive effect as there is nothing else I can pinpoint which is causing this.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is this appeared October 2022 from out of nowhere. But I guess there’s no rhyme or reason to these things.",

    "body": "I recently received a complimentary tube of Reskin Solution Foam (4.05 oz) in the mail in exchange for my honest review of the product. Reskin Solution Foam is a foaming cleanser from Korean beauty brand Reskin Cosmetics. I have heard of the brand in passing but had never tried any of their products before. I went on to CosDNA to see how the ingredients ranked and was totally surprised to see that it did not have an entry there! I made one immediately for it, here it is: http://www.cosdna.com/cht/cosmetic_56d9312905.html\n\nReskin Solution Foam ingredients:\nGlycerin, Myristic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Potassiun Cocoyl Glycinate, Water, Potassium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid ,Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lauric Acid, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, PEG-40 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Lilium Candidum Flower Extract. Anthemis Nobilis, Flower Extract, Melissa Officinalis Flower Leaf/Stem Water, Tocopheryl Acetate, Trisodium EDTA, PEG-14M, Fragrance.\n\n The description on the tube reads \"Deep Cleansing / Pore Care / Sebum Care\" and the website describes it as being good for those with sensitive skin, for reducing the tight feeling after washing, and to gently remove makeup and sebum. The cleanser is thick, bright white, and shiny.\n                                                                                                            \n The cleanser has a strong scent; partly floral, partly sterile smelling. It's not an unenjoyable aroma, but it is stronger than I would prefer to be for a product I use to wash my face. The Reskin Solution Foam is very foamy! This cleanser bubbles up in massive amounts. I used it with my fingers alone, a silicone sponge, a textile sponge, and a facial brush. It was excessively frothy when I used it on the face brush and textile sponge.\n\n I always doubt when a non-oil cleanser claims to be able to remove makeup but The Reskin Solution Foam is pretty decent at taking it off. The only straggler was layers and layers of a waterproof flocking mascara I wore on one day. Everything else came off great. Impressively so for this type of cleanser.\n\n\nIn addition to being wonderfully bubbly this cleanser did not leave my skin feeling dry as most cleansers tend to do. I have dry, aging skin and that is a huge issue for me. After a few days of use I started to notice tiny little black heads and what appeared to be clogged pores, mostly on my nose and cheeks. Within another few days all those blackheads and clogged pores cleared up and my skin looked much more vibrant and smooth. I have been using the Reskin Solution Foam for a couple of weeks past when the mini purge happened and my skin hasn't done anything like that since. I wasn't using any other new products or actives concurrently so I think the foam may have helped clear out some sebum dwelling a bit deeper in the pores.\n\nHow the Rating Work\nEffectiveness is 2/3 of the Total Rating \nPackaging is 1/3 of the Total rating\nPhysical Qualities is 1/3 of the rating\n\nReskin Solution Foam Individual Ratings (0 - 5)\n\nEffectiveness = 5\n\nThis cleanser did not irritate my skin, did not make my skin feel taut or dry, and did not cause any negative reactions (I consider the mini-purge quite a positive). It appeared to lift the sebum out of clogged pores within a few days and kept my skin looking smoother and less dull. One point for each thing mentioned.\n\nPackaging = 3\n\nThe cleanser comes in a white plastic tube with a flip-top cap that it sits upright on. There is a mirrored silver strip at the top, the lettering and design is attractive but the overall look is cheap. The tube is recyclable and encourages you to do so in two places. I give one point for lettering, one for being recyclable in my area, and one for being easy to use and store.\n\nPhysical Qualities = 3\n\nThe cleanser is very thick, shiny, and white. It is foams up extremely well and rinses clean, leaving no residue. The scent is very strong and is floral and hospital like. One point each for looking attractive, not dripping, foaming well, and rinsing well. Minus one for the strong scent.\n\nReskin Solution Foam Total Rating = 4\n\nAs with all products, your mileage may vary (YMMV). The Reskin Solution Foam works great on my dry, aging, acne-prone skin. If you are looking for a new cleanser try to sample this, it's a good one!\n\n\n(I received this product for free from the company in exchange for my unbiased review posted on my Instagram account; I am electing to post here additionally) \n\nFull post & photos here: http://epithelialdreams.blogspot.com/2017/09/reskin-solution-foam-review.html\n",

    "body": "Hey, SCA! I posted this in the Daily Questions thread yesterday, but hope I'll get more visibility this way. \n\nIs/was anyone else a fan of the [Skinfix foaming oil cleanser from before their brand overhaul and move to Sephora](https://www.influenster.com/reviews/skinfix-foaming-oil-cleanser-34oz)? This is my absolute favorite second cleanser — I love the super-creamy, rich, dense foam and the barely-there scent, and it leaves my skin feeling so clean but never dry or tight. (I have very dehydrated, combination skin.) But with Skinfix's brand overhaul a year or two ago, it seems they've not only updated the packaging, but [reformulated it as well](https://www.sephora.com/product/barrier-foaming-oil-cleanser-P442836). I've been subsisting on a panic-driven eBay haul of the original version ever since but will soon be down to my last bottle. Sad.\n\nHere are their relative ingredients lists (looks like they mainly took out most of the fruit extracts, which might not be so bad?):\n\n**Original:** Water/Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Panthenol, Betaine, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydrolyzed Chondrus Crispus Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Rose Extract, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Flower/Leaf Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Extract, Rubus Ideaus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Melo (Melon) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n**New (Barrier+) version:** Water/Eau/Aqua, Glycerin, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Gluconolactone, Jojoba Oil/Macadamia Seed Oil Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Hydroxypropyl Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Coconut Acid, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Chloride, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate.\n\nHas anyone used both versions — or just the new one — and are you willing to share your thoughts? I'll probably end up purchasing the new version anyway, just to try it, but I'd love to have some insight beforehand, if possible! \n(I'd also appreciate any recs for similar cleansers from folks who've used the old one before!)",

    "body": "EDIT 3:\n\nLooks like I solved it! What I neglected to mention before was that I made foaming hand soap with the same issue when I used euxyl pe 9010 (phenoxyethanol and ehg) because I ran out of LGP.  When I made my body wash that turned green I used LGP from a seller on amazon who I heavily suspect actually sold the bottles with a phenoxyethanol based preservative instead. Once I used LGP from a more legitimate supplier, it quit changing color. \n\nThe lotions I color blue also use pe 9010 but without the color change so I suspect it's a reaction between certain surfactants and phenoxyethanol.\n\nLesson learned - DONT BUY INGREDIENTS FROM AMAZON!!!\n\n\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nObservations:\n\n* 15% c14-16 solution with blue 1, stayed brilliant blue for days (the color change happens near instantly and gets worse over a few days)\n* .5% liquid germall, stayed brilliant blue\n* Mix of fragrance and Peg 40 HCO, stayed brilliant blue\n* Added mass of the body wash equivalent to fragrance and HCO to previous, stayed blue. ph was made 5.5\n* Added more body wash to previous, began to turn turquoise. unsure if it's the change or the addition of more yellow body wash.\n\n--\n\nEDIT: Will be testing if blue 1 reacts with certain ingredients specifically rather than put in the effort and make a whole nother shower gel with just one ingredient removed.\n\n--\n\nI have made a body wash with basically the same formula year ago that was the blue I liked and didn't change color.\n\n**Formula:**\n\n* Water - qs\n* Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate - 13%\n* Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate - 7.5%\n* Cocomidapropyl Betaine - 15%\n* Glyceryl Caprylate Caprate - 1%\n* Crothix - 1%\n* Polyquat 7 - .5%\n* PEG-40 HCO - 1%\n* Fragrance - .4%\n* Liquid Germall Plus - .5%\n* Lactic Acid - qs\n* Tetrasodium EDTA - 0.1%\n* Blue 1 (pure powder form) - So little I couldn't weigh it on my scale.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Mix surfactants and glyceryl caprylate caprate in double boiler. Gradually add water.\n2. Mix fragrance with peg-40 HCO.\n3. After cooldown, add the rest and fragrance blend.\n4. Add lactic acid as needed to adjust pH.\n5. Add color\n\npH is around 7. Active surfactant matter is 15%. Color was more yellow than last batch as the c14-16 olefin was from a different supplier who had more yellow powder, but the blue color was acceptable enough.\n\nI made a batch of this a year ago with zero issues and the only change was me replacing SLS with sodium methyl cocoyl taurate (still the same amount of active surfactant) and it having a pH of around 5-5.5. I couldn't find anything on google or chemists corner about things with blue 1 turning green either.\n\nAny help or ideas is appreciated, so thanks in advance!\n\nThe fragrance used does have vanillin but I had no issues with it in previous batches and lotions colored blue.",

    "body": "Alright, this was both a very easy and very hard review to put together as my views on this Water Based Cleanser are probably a little biased LOL! You see…this Cleanser saved my life…\n\nLOL, not that dramatic but pretty close. If you remember (or don’t) I decided about a month ago that it would be an excellent idea to use an “all-natural” Bar Soap that had been listed as okay for use on the face. WRONG LOL…over the two plus weeks I used it I ended up stripping my Skin, clogging my pores, inviting breakouts, and generally messing everything up.\n\nWell, after that experience I really needed to switch to something that was going to reverse what I had done to myself. This Make P:rem Cleansing Foam jumped out since it has been recommended by a few bloggers as being great for Sensitive Skin. \n\nThe first thing that I surprised me about this Product was just how creamy/foamy it truly is. Most pH Balanced Cleansers do a decent job (at best) of foaming up…but this one feels really thick and luxurious. Especially after mixing it in my Nooni Whip Maker…WOW! The closest pH Balanced Cleanser I can compare it to is the Sulwhasoo EX Brightening Cleansing Foam. \n\nAs for the Formula…there are a couple of Ingredients that do raise some concern. The Coconut Based Surfactants (not an issue) followed by a few Essential Oils (can be an issue). I didn’t have a problem with them but I would hesitate from recommending this as the ultimate gentle Cleanser as Essential Oils pose a problem for some. Bergamot Oil and Sage Oil are both here. In addition to the Oils we also have Raspberry Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Citric Acid (which I assume is there to help lower the pH). \n\nEssential Oils aside…this Cleanser brought my Skin back from the brink so fast I was truly shocked. The foam feels so comfortable and luxurious…and the mild herbal scent was relaxing. Just after a few uses my Skin seemed to be less red and the few angry red bumps I had developed were much more calm.\n\nOver the past few weeks I have fallen in love with this Product LOL! Usually I am not a fan of such a “basic” Cleanser. Give me some antioxidants, give me some brightening…something! But, this Make P:rem Safe Me Cleanser was exactly what I needed in the moment. I came in and quietly said “I’m just gonna pop in here and fix this.” and went on its way.\n\nMy struggle with wholeheartedly recommending this Product (aside from the plastic bottle) is that I think my view is a victim of circumstance. If my Skin was happy and healthy at the time I brought this into my Routine I could totally see myself as calling it boring, basic, or not doing that much. And again, those Essential Oils would keep from saying its the new go-to for Sensitive Skin peeps.\n\nPersonally, I plan to keep the rest of this bottle as my “In Case Of Emergency…Use This” Cleanser. For those that aren’t particularly triggered by Essential Oils (LOL)…this is an excellent go to for days when your Skin is feeling overworked or (in my case) you made a bad call with another Product. I feel like I would even put this one above my other favorites from Peach & Lily and Youth To The People (for the purpose of bringing Skin back to a happy state) as its creamy consistency adds a bit of comfort/luxury that Gel Style Cleansers have a hard time matching.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Coco-Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Potassium Benzoate, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-67, Potassium Cocoate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Sodium Acetate, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqlgae0atjo41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea705dc9de5e8a1293e4b9371c2ced4d8c677813",

There are a lot of products on the market that contain a lot of chemicals, many of which have by now become familiar sights in ingredients lists. There are an awful lot of them derived from coconut and palm exclusively, but there are also a lot of them that can be derived from other sources. There isn't any regulation currently in place (at least in the United States, that I am aware of) that requires manufacturers to disclose the source of their chemicals, which can lead to a lot of companies falsely claiming that their products are coconut and/or palm free, when they are just the opposite. Some of the chemicals you will see are things like Vitamin A-palmitate. This one in particular can be tricky as it can be found naturally in beef fat, or it can be derived from coconut or palm plants. You see it a lot in milk, particularly milk that is 2% or less milk fat, which would make you think that it is derived from beef fat, but when you start digging, you find out that it is far more readily available (and therefore cheaper for dairies to buy in the quantities they use) to acquire a palm derived version. Now, devil's advocate here, it may be simply that the dairies do not actually know that they are adding a palm derived product into their milk, as they are likely going through a bulk supplier.\n\nI have also come to realize that there are a lot of companies who advertise things as being coconut and/or palm free and are completely unaware that the chemicals they use come from those sources.

    "body": "# Recommended Product Ingredients\n\n​I always have clients review their hair care routine with me during appointments, which helps me recommend better products for their needs. The most common issue people share is experiencing a loss of effectiveness in their products over time. This results from a need to balance cleaning your hair with moisturizing it. Below I've provided a guide to help balance your hair care routine based on the recommendations I usually give my clients, complete with a list of the most effective ingredients for each category. I purposely left non-detergents (soaps) off of the list because they use oils to remove contaminants, which I've found does not clean hair as well.  (This is the full blog but if you want to screenshot the ingredient lists the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-recommended-product-ingredients.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** Surfactant cleansers are detergents or cleaning agents. They work by surrounding and lifting residue off of the hair strand so water can rinse it away. On a product's ingredient list you generally see them listed towards the top. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\*​\n\n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n* Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n* Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n* Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n* Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n* Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n* Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate \n* Ammonium lauryl sulfate ​\n* Ammonium laureth sulfate\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine\n* Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n* Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n* Sodium lauroamphoacetate\n* Sodium sulfosuccinate\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine\n* Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n* Sodium lauryl sulfate \\*\n\n*\\* Sodium lauryl sulfate is not recommended for daily use.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Non Surfactant Cleanser **Definition:** This cleaning agent does not completely lift oil and grease off of the hair strand, meaning it does not fully remove them. Doing so lightly cleanses your hair while also retaining moisture (i.e. conditioning it). It is not recommended for use with silicones, mineral oil or petroleum products because these ingredients deposit a [residue](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/493588) under the hair's cuticle that require a surfactant cleanser to remove. I usually suggest using a clarifying shampoo once a month with this type of cleanser. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Detoxes, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. See [How Often Should I Shampoo?](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-how-often-should-i-shampoo.html) ​for frequency.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil\n* Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\n* Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil\n* Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n* Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Detox **Definition:** While similar to the Cleanser category, the Detox category is stronger. These cleansing agents remove product build up and help with demineralization of the hair. **Found In:** Shampoos, Clarifying Shampoos, Pre Arts **Recommended Routine:** Can be used once a month by all hair types. Helpful for oily hair.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Disodium EDTA (Ethylamine Diamine Tetraacetic Acid)\n* Pentasoidum Pentetate\n* Sodium phytate\n* Phytic acid\n* Citric acid (needs large enough quantity to be effective)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Humectants **Definition:** T​his ingredient helps retain moisture from water by attracting it to the hair strand in humid climate conditions. However, in dry weather humectants have the opposite effect and will transfer moisture from your hair into the atmosphere. This can leave your hair dehydrated, which may not be what you want depending on its current state.*Tip: Humectants are complementary to silicones and plant oils.* **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category.\\*\\*Ingredients:\\*\\**Hydrolyzed Proteins*\n\n* Hydrolyzed Elastin, silk, keratin, collagen \n* Peptides (wheat, oat, soy...)\n* Amino acids (wheat, oat, soy) or glycine, alanine, proline, etc.\n* Cocodimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein, i.e. keratin, silk, rice, soy)\n* Cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (source of protein)\n* Hydrolyzed oat flour\n\n*For Use In Humid Weather​*\n\n* Vegetable glycerin\n* ​Sorbitol\n\n*Plant Gels*\n\n* Panthenol\n* Flax Seed Gel\n* Okra Gel\n* Aloe Vera\n* Hydroxyethylcellulose\n* Pectin\n* Xanthan Gum\n* Guar Gum\n* Marshmallow Root\n* Slippery Elm​\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Soluble Silicones **Definition:** This ingredient coats the hair shaft to lock in moisture, reduce frizz, add slip, and give hair the coveted soft and silky feel. Soluble silicones can be washed out with non surfactant cleansers. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Using a detox once a month is recommended with this category. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Any silicone with PEG as a prefix\n* Bis-peg/ppg-16/16 peg/ppg-16/16 (This is an emulsifier - not for shine or lubrication)\n* Cyclomethicone\n* Dimethicone copolyol\n* DEA PG-Propyl PEG/PPG-18/21 Dimethicone\n* Dimethicone PEG-8 Phosphate\n* Dimethicone-PG Diethylmonium Chloride\n* Hydrolyzed Silk PG-Propyl Methylsilanediol Crosspolymer\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat protein/hydroxypropyl polysiloxane and cystine/silicone co-polymers\n* Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Silanetriol\n* Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol\n* Lauryl methicone copolyol\n* PEG-40/PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl/Hydropropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG/PPG-14/4 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PEG-12 Dimethicone\n* PEG/PPG-20/15 Dimethicone\n* PPG-8 Methylaminopropyl, Hydroxypropyl Dimethicone Copolymer\n* PEG-7 Amodimethicone\n* PEG-8 Disteramonium Chloride PG-Dimethicone\n* PEG-33 (and) PEG-8 Dimethicone (and) PEG-14\n* Silanetriol\n* Silicone Quaternium-8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Plant Oils **Definition:** This ingredient is used to retain moisture, condition hair, protect from damage and minimize dryness. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** Can be used daily by all hair types. Helpful for dry hair.  **Ingredients:**\n\n* Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) Oil \n* Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil\n* Olive (Olea Europaea) Oil\n* Argan (Argania Spinosa) Oil\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Category:** Preservatives **Definition:** Additives that prevent spoilage. Most consumer products contain preservatives because without them any water-based solution will eventually grow mold or bacteria. **Found In:** Shampoos, Conditioners, Styling Aids **Recommended Routine:** A routine is not applicable for this category since it's included in most products, but pay attention to whether your products cause scalp irritation. That could be a sign to switch to, or alternate with, preservative free options.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* Sodium Benzoate\n* Potassium Sorbate \n* Benzoic acid\n* Dehydroacetic acid\n\n*​Sources:* [*Cationic Compounds in Cosmetics*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/search?q=surfactants)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Detergents Which Remove: Silicone*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2016/05/detergents-which-remove-silicones.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog​*[*Essentials of Hair Care Often Neglected: Hair Cleansing*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)*, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)*[*Glycerin and Humidity*](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/glycerin-and-humidity.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*[*Film Forming Humectants - What They Are And Why You Need Them*](http://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2014/07/film-forming-humectants-what-they-are.html)*, Science-y Hair Blog*",

There's a lot of misinfo on personal care products because some people infer \"literally contains gluten\" from company statements such as \"no gluten ingredients but we don't test/guarantee GF status.\"\n\nThere are a few reasons why this statement on a non-food isn't alarming:\n\n* GF label laws are specific to foods so companies may be hesitant to make these claims because they do not know how it might be enforced. Those labeling GF may not be doing any testing or supplier verification knowing this. \n* amount that you might ingest is a lot smaller than food - 21 ppm in a bread is worse than 21 ppm in a lotion or facewash\n* ingredients are typically synthetic or very highly processed so CC unlikely \n* plants less likely to have large amounts of gluten/oats in them, so in-plant CC less likely than food\n\nThis [US study](https://academic.oup.com/jaoac/article-abstract/99/3/586/5657997?redirectedFrom=fulltext) tested a bunch of personal care products. Of those that had detectable gluten, all had gluten ingredients like wheat germ oil or hydrolyzed wheat protein. \n\nGiven the above things, a product without gluten ingredients should be safe.",

So I treated them some creams, moisturizing lipstick (which I hated as a guy but well, had the job done) for a few days and they were back to normal. Everything swell. I stopped treating them, then and BAM - not two days have passed and they worsen with every day again, getting back to the state I described above.\n\nMy allegations went on the toothpaste as I also have some red-ish \"outline\" around my lips (as if they were burned by some chilli pepper, you know), as if the paste burned them.

    "body": "**Tl;dr version:** *After my last dentist visit in late July, I started having lingering, gnawing pain in multiple teeth that lasted hours, usually after brushing. The same spots started developing rough patches (which cleared up mysteriously after several weeks). My teeth appear healthy, and the dentist said there is no decay. I finally narrowed it down to the toothpaste I was using — but I’d been using the same toothpaste for a year without any of these issues. I have three questions at the end of this post.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThanks to anybody who replies, and I apologize for the long post. It’s complicated, and I don’t want to leave out an important detail.\n\nLong story short, I’ve had major sensitivity problems since my early twenties. Despite my teeth appearing “perfect” according to multiple dentists, I’ve had ongoing sensitivity issues, particularly to sugary foods, and the pain would last long after the exposure to the food. Even swishing with water or mouthwash or chewing gum did not help—my teeth would ache after eating until I could brush them. Then, in my late thirties, I had a filling (which turned out to be unnecessary according to multiple dentists) in my lateral incisor that triggered *constant* aching pain in that tooth. Every time any air touches it or my tongue touches it, it would hurt. The pain felt “cold” and was also associated with a thick, salty saliva near that tooth. However, multiple dentists told me that there was nothing wrong with the tooth and essentially there was nothing they could do for the pain.\n\nI have tried every anti-sensitivity toothpaste available in the States, with every active ingredient — high fluoride concentration, stannous fluoride, potassium nitrate — and none of them helped with this pain. The potassium nitrate in particular makes my teeth and gums incredibly *itchy*.\n\nIn desperation, in October 2022, I ordered some imported toothpastes online: Sensodyne with Novamin, and an Italian toothpaste called Biorepair Intensive Night Anti-Erosion. I was not expecting much, but the Biorepair had noticeable results after the first use. After a week, I was no longer sensitive to sugars and was only sensitive to cold, and after two months, all of my sensitivity and pain was completely gone. It was like a miracle. No other toothpaste (even other ones by Biorepair) came close to this effectiveness.\n\nWell, that lasted until my last dentist visit in July 2023. I am not sure what happened at that visit, but immediately afterward, I noticed my sensitivity had returned and was worse than ever. And since that point, it has only gotten worse and worse. Not only does the Biorepair not do the trick anymore, but I’ve noticed it actually seems to be eroding my teeth. After brushing, I will feel a gnawing pain on my teeth that lasts for hours\n\nI am not sure if Biorepair changed their ingredients or what. It doesn’t taste the same anymore, and after working perfectly for almost a year, it’s suddenly causing me pain. I have no idea if something happened at my dentist visit to cause this or it was just a coincidence of timing. This sucks because it’s the only thing that helped my sensitivity. It also sucks because it took me 2-3 months to realize it was the Biorepair causing this issue — as I mentioned, this has been like a miracle for me until this point.\n\nAnother odd wrinkle of this is that specific spots on my teeth surface have become really rough, and those specific spots are also where I’m having a lot of pain issues. I looked it up, and it sounded like it was either tartar or erosion. I thought it must be erosion, because it was not coming off even when I picked at it with a fingernail, but then using the Biorepair *exclusively* for a week, the rough spots went away again, although those spots still have pain and sensitivity issues. Now I’m not sure if the rough spots were tartar, which the Biorepair loosened up and dissolved, or the rough spots were enamel erosion, which the Biorepair filled in and “repaired.”\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that these spots are *not* near the gumline, where I have some recession that’s been there my whole life. The spots that are rough/hurting are random spots on the front, back, or biting surface of my teeth, or between two adjoining teeth. My dentist suggested gum graft, but I don’t see how that would help, since the problem areas are not all near the gumline.\n\nHere are some photos of my teeth. You can’t really see the rough patches, but you can see the recession. (The worst parts in terms of recession are the molars, which aren’t visible in these shots.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8a6snu4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5409ddceafae1fbaa2f6d10ca2d8bd27c602daa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3lilnu4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b21dc3af95b940d43828f8f300f682671c1401f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrugmnu4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e226b1b5b7266350f523b64e37d525ce2be57a14\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akn7eou4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5527cabdf4be8c4a1db24458f86990afe8314c6d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvn7mnu4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdc2234431c87cfde402c97659ec50d040917189\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ishodsu4lzyb1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f57422f5efcda693ba32112271dad8e77c12fa1c\n\nAnother thing that started happening only since this dentist visit is that every time I brush with this Biorepair toothpaste, I’ll get a burning feeling at the top of my throat, similar to heartburn. I am not swallowing significant amounts of this toothpaste, but I am not rinsing after I brush either. Again, this only started recently after using this product for a year with no issues.\n\nHere is the complete ingredients list of this toothpaste. I suspect it’s the citric acid that’s the culprit; I know it’s really corrosive, and I can’t understand why a toothpaste that is meant to have prolonged contact with your teeth (for the hydroxyapatite to work) would include this ingredient, even in small amounts. Unfortunately, it’s in every one of their products.\n\n>Ingredients: Aqua, Zinc Hydroxyapatite, Hydrated Silica, Sorbitol, Xylitol, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Cellulose Gum, Silica, Zinc PCA, Zinc Citrate, Aroma, Tetrapotassium Pyrophosphate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Sodium Saccharin, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene.\n\nI’m having a really hard time finding a good alternative. The Biorepair just works *way* better than anything else I’ve tried for sensitivity, including other toothpastes with nano-hydroxyapatite. I think it may actually be the zinc that’s helping so much, because it’s antibacterial. (This one includes zinc-hydroxyapatite, zinc PCA, and zinc citrate. And even though it’s causing this gnawing pain, it *still* helps the sensitivity significantly more than anything else.)\n\nOne problem I am having is that most hydroxyapatite toothpastes in America also include whitening products that are not good for people with thin/weak enamel, and they also are all obsessed with using “natural” ingredients that don’t seem to be as effective at fighting plaque/bacteria as other toothpastes. I’ve tried Boka, Davids, and Periosciences, as well as several Sensodynes (including the one with Novamin) and multiple other varieties of Biorepair. I even tried a Biorepair mouthwash, which also seemed to have a corrosive effect on my teeth. The Sensodyne with Novamin is the only one I have been able to stick with for more than a week because most of the others have immediate, painful results — and the Novamin is doing basically *nothing* for my sensitivity, leaving me in a lot of pain both during and between meals.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Is it likely that it’s the citric acid in the Biorepair that’s been causing my recent issues? Why would this start suddenly after a dentist visit when I’ve been using the toothpaste for a year?\n2. What is the best alternative I can get that will apply a protective coating to my teeth? I know from experience this is what works, but it doesn’t seem like any brand other than the Biorepair can pull it off.\n3. Is my dentist telling the truth that nothing can be done about this pain? I thought he could apply a composite bonding material to cover up the sensitive areas, but for some reason he doesn’t want to do that. At this point, I’d be happy to just have all the teeth drilled or removed — the constant pain is not worth keeping “healthy” natural teeth in my mouth. It really interferes with my life in a huge way, in spite of how apparently healthy my teeth look. (Even my recession has been called “mild,” but the sensitivity certainly wasn’t.)\n\nIt’s very frustrating, because I’ve tried to do everything right to protect my teeth, and they *look* fine, but I keep having issues with pain and nobody seems to know what to do to help it.",

Here are the ingredients: Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Myristic Acid, Water (Aqua), PPG-10 Methyl Glucose, Sodium Citrate, Yogurt Powder, Phytosteryl/ Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate\n\nI'm no expert, but nothing looks terribly novel to me except for maybe the yogurt powder. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks!",

I would really like some guidance from people to see what ingredients might be breaking me out. Realistically, anything could be breaking me out, but if people break out from similar products then I can at least see what might be the culprit. I'm a mid 20s guy by the way, so not an issue with hormones I'm pretty sure.\n\nHere's a list of everything I've tried, with ingredients:\n\n\n**Neutrogena On The Spot Acne Treatment** (Water, Bentonite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax NF, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Laurate, Cetyl Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylparaben, Propylparaben)\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser** (Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate and PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum)\n\n**Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser** (Water, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lauryl Glucoside, Potassium Accylates Copolymer, PEG 120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance)\n\n**Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel** (Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Isononyl Isononanoate, Alcohol, Dimethicone, PEF-12 Dimethicone, Polysilicone-15, Glycol Dimethacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acetate Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolized Hyaluronic Acid, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polysilicone-13, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Polystyrene, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanol Amine, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Hydrogen Dimethicone, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methylparaben, Propylparaben )\n\n**Elta MD UV Clear** (Purified Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Niacinamide, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lactic Acid, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.)\n\n**SolBar PF Liquid Sunscreen** (Homosalate 12.0%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 6.0%, Avobenzone 3.0%, Octocrylene 1.5%, SD Alcohol 63% v/v, Isobutyl Stearate, Cyclomethicone, PVP/Eicosene Copolymer, Dimethicone, Hydroxypropylcellulose, Acylates Octylacrylamide Copolymer)\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Gel** (Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (solvent/water-binding agent), Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (cell-communicating ingredient), Hydroxyethylcellulose (gel-based thickener), Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract (antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (anti-irritant), Bisabolol (anti-irritant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting agent), Tetrasodium EDTA (chelating agent).)\n\n**Sebamed Clear Face Gel** (Water, Aloe barbadensis leaf gel, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sorbitol, Pantenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Carbomer, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sorbic Acid.)\n\n**Mineral Oil**\n\n**Petrolatum**\n\n**Albolene**\n\nRight now, *I have no routine* because of the mess skin care products create for me.

Without a clear diagnosis/ diagnoses it is difficult to say which ingredients are likely culprits for these symptoms.\n\nI have highlighted some potentially problematic ingredients. In acne vulgaris some struggle with depositing silicones such as dimethicone and cyclomethicone. Caprylic/ capric triglycerides are AKA fractionated coconut oil, tocopherol is AKA vitamin E. PEG- prefix means water soluble, so clogging ingredients may be much less of a problem in a cleanser format compared with a leave on one.\n\nDrying alcohol and butylene/ propylene glycols are known irritants, skin barrier disruptors and penetration enhancers. Fragrance is an irritant and the second most common topical allergen after nickel.\n\nAny preservative - including the much maligned parabens - is an issue for someone somewhere. I *think* sorbic acid and/ or potassium sorbate cause flushing for some but that would need double checking.\n\nPhysical/ all mineral sunscreens are recommended over chemical sunscreens in reactive skin. I rate [Derma-e Antioxidant Natural Sunscreen SPF 30 body] (http://dermae.com/product/343/Antioxidant-Natural-Sunscreen-SPF-30-Body-Lotion.html) (identical to the face version which claims oil-free status). This has no silicones nor drying alcohol, does have 1% green tea extract, a little sodium ascorbyl phosphate (form of vitamin C useful in acne), caprylic/ capric triglycerides, a little of a fatty alcohol.\n\nCleansers ... totally different tack would be a micellar water, the gentlest ingredients wise is [Bioderma Sensibio H2O] (http://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/sensibio/h2o) which has none of the regular preservatives, one glycol way down the ingredients list. Even if you don't love micellar cleansing waters it might help you with the elimination process, or they can be used as a second cleanse after an emulsifying oil.\n\nFoaming cleanser wise I rate Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Wash Gel which has a short ingredients list, is pH appropriate and is ridiculously gentle (use it on my full body). It is based on cocoamidopropyl betaine which someone suggested is coconut-based in your other thread. There is no link between this surfactant and the potentially comedogenic oil, it has been completely transformed chemically.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: I believe this product stands as one of the top baby shampoo options available at a reasonable price. It has obtained the EWG's certification for safety compliance, containing only a single moderate hazard ingredient. While there are reports from the EWG associating Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice with potential carcinogenic risks, it's worth noting that most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare and topical applications, utilize the clear gel from within the aloe vera leaf, excluding the outer part containing aloin. Manufacturers typically employ processes that remove aloin to undetectable levels. However, parents who harbor concerns regarding the presence of Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice may opt for alternative products. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice\\*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil\\*, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\\*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract\\*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract\\*, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract\\*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Sodium Chloride, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dehydroacetic Acid, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Citric Acid \\*Organic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\n   * Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice is widely used in skincare products, including baby shampoos, due to its soothing, hydrating, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is generally considered safe for topical use.\n   * However, it's worth noting that certain parts of the aloe vera plant contain a compound called aloin, which has been linked to potential carcinogenic effects when ingested in large amounts. Most commercial aloe vera products, including skincare products and topical applications, are made from the clear gel found inside the aloe vera leaf, not the outer part of the leaf where aloin is found. The process used to prepare aloe vera for commercial use generally removes aloin to non-detectable levels.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Aloe vera is usually soothing, but some individuals may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions, such as redness, rash, burning or itching sensations, especially with frequent use.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Rarely, some individuals may have a more severe allergic reaction to aloe vera. This could result in symptoms like swelling, severe redness, or difficulty breathing.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

Her pediatrician told me not to worry, but I'm still concerned because it's hard to convey how much and how directly this got into her eye. Instead of coming out of the container in slow globs like I was expecting, this came out as a thin, forceful projectile stream. I can easily shoot this stuff ten feet across the room. It hit her directly in the eye and formed a pool over her entire eye socket. We quickly rinsed all of the exterior soap away, and she even voluntarily opened her eye as we were pouring water over it (though I'm not sure how much this actually flushed).

I have a lot of closed comedones on my chin and chicks area and some on my forehead near the eyebrows. I also have blackheads on my chin and chicks. I usually don’t get any active breakouts for the exception of some cystic, under skin pimples every once in a while. \n\nI’ve been using differin gel since the beginning of April, and before that I’ve tried different AHA, BHA and benzoyl peroxide products. Now my routine looks like that:\n\nNight time:\nI use these 2 products to cleanse\n\nFace balm: Bandi Anti Irritate Balm\nCaprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, C10-18 Triglycerides, Tripelargonin, C13-15 Alkane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Parfum/Fragrance\n\nFace wash: BASICLAB MICELLIS (PINK)\n\nAqua (Water), Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Inulin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Trehalose, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Aspartate, Zinc Gluconate, Propanediol, Propylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate\n\nThen I dry my face wait for a minute or two to make sure it’s dry and use Differin gel\nAfter that I wait for about 30 minutes and apply Purito Oat-in Calming Gel Cream\n\nAvena Sativa (Oat) Seed Water (77%), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 2,3-Butanediol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Squalane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Carbomer, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Sodium Surfactin, Beta-Glucan\n\nI do that for 2 nights and then have a “break night” on which I skip differin and go with the Purito gel cream twice. I’m considering buying Purito centella serum to use that day too.\n\nFor day time I use the same face wash and face cream for the exception after the break night on which I use the Cerave BHA cleanser. \n\nAQUA/WATER/EAU, COCAMIDOPROPYL HYDROXYSULTAINE, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LAUROYL SARCOSINATE, NIACINAMIDE, GLUCONOLACTONE, PEG-150 PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRASTEARATE, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE, ZEA MAYS OIL/CORN OIL, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, CALCIUM GLUCONATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SALICYLIC ACID, SODIUM BENZOATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CHOLECALCIFEROL, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, TETRASODIUM EDTA, HYDROLYZED HYALURONIC ACID, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nI know I should use SPF during day time but I cannot find one which doesn’t make my skin breakout and doesn’t cause an allergic reaction. I also don’t really wear make up.  What would you change?",

I can't use anything with Cocamidopropyl Betaine (after a few days, week of using my skin itches a little and got some small red bumps); my skin also doesn't like glucosides (Coco Glucoside f.e.), I think it's not an allergy, but it just dries out my skin very much, no matter if this is a milk/cream formula or foam, or gel.\n\nFrom the mildest detergents, I react well to Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate. It's hard to find something that isn't super expensive, isn't a Dove creamy bar (I react badly to it, like my face sweats/oil a lot) or doesn't have Cocamidopropyl Betaine/Glucosides in it.\n\nWell, I found a cleanser with SCI and without these sensitizing ingredients. It's a thick gel/paste, but it has honey (Mel) in it and I'm afraid of skin reaction to this ingredient.

They can be naturally derived or synthetically manufactured.\n\nThe natural surfactants below come from natural sources. After extraction, they go through minimal processing that makes them compatible for further formulation. Some say they are \"not natural\" because they go through a \"chemical process\", but that is a misnomer. Everything in nature has a \"chemical process\" to it. The difference here is that all natural surfactants are often derived from plants or produced by microorganisms, and are generally considered better than their lab-synthesized chemical counterparts due to their \"biodegradability, lower toxicity, and renewable source. Natural surfactants are more likely to break down naturally in the environment, minimizing their impact on ecosystems. They also tend to be less harmful to human health and are often derived from plant-based resources, which are renewable and sustainable\"\n\nAND HOW!! The best combination of surfactants that I use for my shampoo line are: SCI (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate ); SLSA (Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate ); SMCT (Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate); Decyl glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, and Coco glucoside. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It’s used in very tiny amounts: the cleanser is tested during production, and if needed, sodium hydroxide is added to bring the product to the correct pH level. It isn’t necessarily used, but if there’s any chance that it might be, it has to be listed on the label by law. It’s very common and perfectly safe. If the US version isn’t using that, it’s using some other alkali for the same purpose.\n\nYou can see that right next to sodium hydroxide is citric acid; that’s used for exactly the same purpose, but in the other direction — if the product turns out to be too alkaline during manufacture, citric acid will be added to bring it to the desired pH level. Again, common and safe. Those ingredients are very far down in the list, which means there’s very little of them in the bottle, because ingredients are always listed in order: there’s less of those pH adjusters than of ceramides, which make up a tiny proportion of the formula.",

    "body": "TLDR SKIP TO BOTTOM!\n\n𝐁𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐒𝐓𝐎𝐑𝐘\nI switched to the La Mar Essence Foaming Cleanser in November of 2024. I’m not sure if I have acne prone skin, or if I just pick and prod and create pimples that weren’t there, but either way this has helped. I have tried many, many cleansers for my skin, since I need it to look good as a model. I have tried Native, which was great until they changed the formula, and the overwhelming amount of scent in the new formula breaks my skin out. It also didn’t help enough that it was a major noticable difference. I tried some cleansers prescribed by my dermatologist, but they dried my skin out so much that I couldn’t use them for longer than a week before quitting. The La Mer cleanser has been the best thing for my skin.\n\nSince starting it in November, I also started using silicone face scrubber pads when I was my face morning and night. Here’s a list broken down into categories of ways it’s helped me, ingredients, etc\n\n\n𝟏.𝐏𝐑𝐈𝐂𝐄\nThe La Mer Essence Foaming Cleanser costs $30 USD for 1oz and $105 USD for 4.2oz. Shipping is complimentary and free samples are included on every order. The price is equal to $25 per ounce, making the large bottle more economically friendly. \n\n𝟐.𝐀𝐌𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐓 𝐎𝐅 𝐓𝐈𝐌𝐄 𝐎𝐅 𝐔𝐒𝐄\nI got the 1oz as a free sample at Neiman Marcus on November 13, 2024. I used that bottle until January 20th, 2025. I am still using my 4.2oz bottle that replaced that one. I go through approximately 2 bottles per year, making the price $210 per year, $17.50 per month, $4.04 per week, $0.58 per day, or $0.29 per use if you wash your face 2 times a day. \n\n𝟑.𝐈𝐍𝐆𝐑𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒\nFull ingredient list (at time of posting):\nMiracle Broth™, Deconstructed Waters™, Tourmaline, The Comforting Ferment\nIngredients: Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Glycerin, Myristic Acid, Behenic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Hydroxide, Lauric Acid, Stearic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Algae Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Powder, Zinc Gluconate, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyptus) Leaf Oil, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Seed Powder, Sodium Gluconate, Calcium Gluconate, Copper Gluconate, Magnesium Gluconate, Niacin, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seedcake, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Seed Meal, Tocopheryl Succinate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Peel Extract, Sea Salt\\Maris Sal\\Sel Marin, Spirulina Platensis (Algae) Powder, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Asparagopsis Armata Extract, Ecklonia Cava Extract, Tourmaline, Caffeine, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Sodium Coco Pg-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Trehalose, Pearl Powder, Sorbitol, Sodium Pca, Nephrite Powder, Homarine Hcl, Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester, Sucrose, Erythritol, Urea, Polyquaternium-51, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Peg-3 Distearate, Laureth-3, Triacetin, Propanediol, Alcohol Denat., Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Bht, Chlorphenesin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Sodium Bicarbonate, Tetrasodium Edta, Disodium Edta, Blue 1 (Ci 42090), Yellow 6 (Ci 15985), Green 5 (Ci 61570), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140)\n\n𝟒.𝐅𝐄𝐄𝐋\nSqueeze the cleanser into your palms, wet, and foam up. It foams nicely and feels nice on the skin. It is not gritty or oily, and definitely “feels” like a cleanser, but not in a  bad way. It’s like a nice shower after a long day.\n\n𝟓.𝐒𝐊𝐈𝐍 𝐓𝐘𝐏𝐄𝐒\nThe La Mer Website claims that this cleanser is for all skin types. It has been amazing for me. I used to have very dry skin. Using this cleanser, I no longer have to use a moisturizer on top, which is nice because I don’t like clogging my pores with excess product if I don’t have to. Occasionally I will have to use a small dab of Native moisturizer or Crème de La Mer in dry areas, but that it not from the cleanser. I am an avid skin picker, and therefore an avid pimple patch user. The dryness comes from the overuse of the pimple patches irritating and drying out my skin, not the cleanser itself. I believe I have always had combination skin, and my face still needs an oil paper sometimes throughout the day, so if you have oilier skin to begin with maybe that is something to be wary of! I do not believe it has made my skin oiler, but it definitely has fixed the dryness.\n\n𝟔.𝐂𝐋𝐎𝐒𝐄𝐃 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐃𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐒/𝐒𝐎𝐅𝐓𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐒\nMy skin definitely feels softer than it used to be. My skin is also less bumpy. I think using this cleanser is combination with the silicone scrubbing pads had made a drastic change in my skin. I had lots of bumps and closed comedones from oily trapped pores. The combination of both has helped bring those closed, filled pores to a head and I am able to pop them out, which then heals flat with no bumps. I’m sure they would come out on their own as well, if you are not as bad of a skin picker as I am. My skin is definitely in better condition than it used to be. \n\n\n𝟕.𝐀𝐂𝐍𝐄\nI feel that this cleanser has made a big difference in my acne. My face is no longer as broken out as it used to be. I still have pimples on my face, but I am 100% certain that I would not if I didn’t try to pop every little bump that I saw appear on my face. No other cleanser has cleared my acne of closed comedones as effective as this one has.\n\n𝟖.𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐊𝐀𝐆𝐈𝐍𝐆\nThis is absolutely the worst part of the product. YOU MUST BUY 3 INCH TUBE SQUEEZERS. I purchased them after learning the hard way that they are needed. I stopped being able to squeeze out product on May 11, 2025. I cut the tube open, not expecting much to be left. The amount left in the bottle is absolutely ridiculous. This is my only gripe with the product. I scraped out all of the remaining product after cutting open the bottle and put it in a 2oz jar. The jar was approximately halfway full when I was done, meaning that there was at least an ounce, possibly more left that I was physically unable to squeeze from the bottle using just my hands. I have learned from my mistake and bought large tube squeezers, like those you would use for toothpaste, to place on the end of the bottle when it it running low and hopefully squeeze the excess product out so that when I cut it open again there is not an excessive amount of product left in it. The amount I have left will last me another month at least, taking us from January 2025 to June 2025, meaning you will only need to spend the $105 a bottle twice a year, making it $210 per year. \n\n𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐂𝐋𝐔𝐒𝐈𝐎𝐍\nI really like the La Mer Essence Foaming Cleanser as a woman/model in her early 20s. It has helped clear my acne, get rid of my closed comedones, fix my skin texture, and repair my moisture barrier. My skin is much smoother now than it used to be and I no longer have to use a moisturizer every day. The packing is absolutely dreadful. Upon cutting open a tube I physically could not squeeze with just my hands anymore, I discovered a significant amount of product left in the bottle that would have gone straight to the trash. Upon placing in a jar, 1oz of the 4.2oz was left in the bottle. You must buy 3 inch tube squeezers to optimize the amount of product you can squeeze out, as well as always cut your bottles before tossing them. I go through approximately 2 4.2 oz bottles per year, making the $105 intimidating price tag only $210 per year. I only have to use one product, so overall I believe that I am saving money in the long run. \n\n\nTLDR SKIP HERE\n\n\nAs a model in her early 20s, I really do recommend the La Mer Essence Foaming Cleanser. It has helped clear my acne and get rid of my closed comedones. The packing sucks, buy tube squeezers and absolutely cut your tubes open before chucking them in the bin or you’ll be wasting $20-$30 worth of product. Worth the splurge if you ask me. ",

Just basic ingredients, try to avoid strong fragrances if youre breaking up bad, i would completely avoid them if its severe. \n\nTry tea tree oil, it worked wonders for my scalp and even face be wary may sting a little so patch test! Also argan oil if you want a nice natural moisturizer i put a half pump on damp hair after shower.\n\nLastly for dandruff/flaky scalp i attribute it the most to drying, i would invest in a good blow dryer if not good technique and make sure its far. When your roots are dried well and moisturized i notice far less flakes. But its like your skin to rest of your body, itll grow thicker and thicker just gotta exfoliate right. Brushing your hair helps",

Perhaps give it another try in a more balanced routine. If not, Cetaphil and La Roche Posay are both good, affordable options to try. \n\nNote: only actives cause purging, so the CeraVe cleanser would not have made you purge \n\nEdit: that being said, the fatty alcohols in CeraVe can break some people out. No one can say for sure what caused your breakout and what is likely to break you out in the future.

I was on the ulta site looking at some exfoliators, since I'm a complete newbie, I have no idea if I'm looking for the right things. I'm South Asian so my skin is more to the brown-tan range. My skin is sensitive and oily/combination, and I'd like to spend less than $15.

I'd like to know if any of those products work well for PIH, also if there are any other good affordable exfoliators for treating PIH. I have already tried the St.Ive's Green Tea Scrub, it just hurt my skin more.",
