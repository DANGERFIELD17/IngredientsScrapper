    "body": "There is a lot of misinformation out there about nasal sprays preventing COVID-19. Unfortunately, there are no convincing studies showing that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19. The published studies investigating whether or not nasal sprays prevent COVID-19 each have major issues, which I will detail here.\n\nI have a PhD in biochemistry and one of my PhD projects was on COVID-19. **The main takeaway of this post is that there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19. Thus, nasal sprays should not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification.**\n\nThis post has become long, so here are the sections in order as they appear:\n\n1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n2. Human clinical trials with placebos\n3. Studies in humans without placebos (which are not clinical trials)\n4. Studies in test tubes/cell culture and why that isn’t transferable to the human respiratory tract\n5. Summary/TLDR and final thoughts\n\nI will name the COVID-19 prevention nasal spray studies I’m going over study 1, study 2, etc. and for other papers cited I’m naming them study A, study B, etc. Basically, I want to make sections of this post easy to refer to and discuss. And if there are other human clinical trials looking at nasal sprays for preventing COVID-19 let me know and I will review them and edit the post to add them in.\n\n# 1. As a brief overview, some major issues with these studies include:\n\n* The fact that the test spray and not the placebo spray contain ingredients that can cause false-negative COVID-19 tests (combined with no information on the timing between applying nasal sprays and taking nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 tests)\n   * Ex: a heparin nasal spray can cause false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests ([study A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649069/)) and carrageenan from vaginal swabs after using carrageenan-containing lube can cause false-negative PCR tests for HPV ([study B](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26963)). If we take the estimate from another paper ([study C](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virology/articles/10.3389/fviro.2021.746824/full)) that nasal sprays get immediately diluted approximately 1:1 by nasal fluid (when the spray volume in each nostril is 0.100 mL), then the amount of carrageenan in a nasal swab taken immediately after spraying the nasal spray is comparable to that in the carrageenan undiluted samples in experiment 4 in study B. Those samples from study B all produced false-negative PCR tests for HPV. (EDIT APRIL 13, 2025: [study R](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913533/) shows carrageenan nasal sprays causing false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and reductions in measured viral loads.)\n* Lack of placebo spray, participants having to seek out the test spray themselves (suggesting they may take more precautions than those in the study taking no spray, not even a placebo)\n* Lack of sufficient information for reproducibility (especially regarding what is considered a positive and a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result)\n* Lack of testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections (how can we say something prevents COVID-19 if we aren’t testing for asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections?)\n* Inappropriate COVID-19 testing methods\n* Wide 95 % confidence intervals for relative risk reductions\n* The group promised a follow-up study with more participants and the trial was completed but the results were never posted (suggesting that the results did not show the test spray preventing COVID-19)\n   * Ex: in [study D](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06685-z) a protocol was published for an upcoming carrageenan nasal spray clinical trial, and that trial finished in 2022 but the [results haven’t been posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04590365?term=NCT04590365&rank=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaazwtXy-AS4JIQcaCCFdLUKzt9K2o3qNww5bkapp7Y8-TxUDmI-EBKjdAk_aem_UhX-7Nu_JhiXcWir4xMcZQ). Generally, if you do a search on [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) with [the condition “COVID” and the intervention/treatment “nasal spray”](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww), you find 41 studies where only 4 have the status “completed with results”, 14 are “completed without results”, 9 have “unknown status” and 6 are “withdrawn” or “terminated”\n* Many nasal spray companies having to majorly walk back false claims of their sprays preventing COVID-19 after warning letters from the FDA (link [here](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A), ignore the Profi nasal spray praise, we’ll get to the study on it lol). As well as a [lawsuit](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2021/10/ftc-sues-utah-based-company-falsely-claiming-its-nasal-sprays-can-prevent-treat-covid-19) about falsely claiming to prevent COVID-19 when it comes to Xlear\n* False claims that we mainly contract COVID-19 through nose cells (and not lung cells) with either no citation or citation of papers that don’t prove that (such as [study E](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9))\n* Lack of acknowledgement that the location in the respiratory tract that aerosols end up is determined by their size (aka a nasal spray will not prevent the sizes of aerosols that end up in your lungs from going into your lungs), see Figure 3 and all the studies referenced in that figure in [study F](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00506-7))\n* Not everyone breathes through their nose\n* Nasal sprays are flushed out of the nasal cavity in a matter of hours\n* Nasal sprays don’t appear to coat even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see [study G](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499839/), [study H](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.931566), [study I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12383290/))\n* Many of these sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which have harmful effects at the concentrations used in nasal sprays in some studies (see [study J](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575893/) and [study K](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028024/) and references therein)\n\nNote: the sizes of aerosols that would end up deposited in your nose are very efficiently filtered by high-quality respirators such as N95s, provided that the N95 is sealed to your face and the seal doesn’t break. This is even true for a respirator with a lot of wear time (see my previous post on some studies looking at the effects of wear time on N95 fit and filtration efficiency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/), again, provided that it stays sealed). This is because the filtration mechanisms that act on the sizes of aerosols that get deposited in your nose do not degrade with wear time (whereas the filtration mechanisms that act on smaller aerosols do degrade with wear time). Thus, while wearing a sealed N95, aerosols containing SARS-C0V-2 in the environment should not be deposited in your nose anyway.\n\nOnto the studies!\n\n# 2. Human clinical trials with placebos\n\n[Study 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629893/)\n\nThe Argentina healthcare workers iota-carrageenan “80 % relative risk reduction” (in quotes because it’s misleading) study\n\nFigueroa JM, Lombardo ME, Dogliotti A, Flynn LP, Giugliano R, Simonelli G, Valentini R, Ramos A, Romano P, Marcote M, Michelini A, Salvado A, Sykora E, Kniz C, Kobelinsky M, Salzberg DM, Jerusalinsky D, Uchitel O. Efficacy of a Nasal Spray Containing Iota-Carrageenan in the Postexposure Prophylaxis of COVID-19 in Hospital Personnel Dedicated to Patients Care with COVID-19 Disease. Int J Gen Med. 2021 Oct 1;14:6277-6286. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S328486. PMID: 34629893; PMCID: PMC8493111.\n\nIssues with study 1:\n\n* Basically [this comment](https://pubpeer.com/publications/578D01FB4482CC282EF7AEBB9CF5DF) on PubPeer but I’ll reiterate the points here too\n* In an [earlier version of the study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255409v1) the authors said \"Finally, a small number of individuals were lost to follow up (6.8%). In sensitivity analysis where it was hypothesized that the 13 lost individuals from the Iota-Carrageenan group were infected, and that the 14 lost individuals from the placebo group were not infected, no differences were found in infection rates of both groups (p= 0.3).\", but that section was removed in the final version of the paper. Basically the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the study (12 of 394 participants, but really, 12 out of 367) is small enough that the results could be very different if the participants lost to follow up (27 people) were not lost to follow up\n* Calculating the percentages of participants testing positive for COVID-19 in each group using the original number of people in each group, as opposed to subtracting the number of people lost to follow-up. Those lost to follow-up should not be included in calculations and assumed to have not tested positive for COVID-19, because we don’t know whether or not they would have tested positive for COVID-19\n* No mention of timing between applying the nasal sprays and taking nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR tests. This is really important because carrageenan can cause false-negative PCR tests (see the point about heparin nasal sprays and carrageenan lube in the beginning of section 1 for more details). If the carrageenan spray causes false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results and the placebo spray does not, that is a major issue in the study design making the results of the study untrustworthy and meaningless\n* Only testing if symptoms arose (missing asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections). Again, we really can’t say anything prevents COVID-19 if we aren’t testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections\n* They report a relative risk reduction of 79.8 % with the 95 % confidence interval for that value being 5.3 % to 95.4 %. This means that, really, they’re pretty sure that being on the carrageenan nasal spray as opposed to the placebo spray lowers your chance of testing positive for COVID-19 by between 5.3 % and 95.4 %, which is a very big range! Combine that with the issue of carrageenan having the ability to cause false-negative tests and this study is garbage!\n\n[Study 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653222001809)\n\nThe **RETRACTED** Indian healthcare workers study with the spray containing xylitol, essential oils and other ingredients\n\nBalmforth D, Swales JA, Silpa L, Dunton A, Davies KE, Davies SG, Kamath A, Gupta J, Gupta S, Masood MA, McKnight Á, Rees D, Russell AJ, Jaggi M, Uppal R.

Not a good sign and I don’t think I need to go into the issues point-by-point in light of this. Check out the PubPeer comments if you’re curious\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 3. Studies in humans without placebos (which are not clinical trials)\n\n[Study 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33759682/)\n\nHypromellose taffix nasal powder study\n\nShmuel K, Dalia M, Tair L, Yaakov N.

On the [SaNOtize website](https://sanotize.com/technology/nasal-spray/faq/), they state both that the spray causes conformational changes to the spike protein (see answer 2 in the first section) and that it doesn’t interfere with rapid antigen testing (see answer 10 in the second section). Rapid antigen tests rely on interactions between proteins from the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2) and antibodies in the test. Thus, changes to the shape of SARS-CoV-2 proteins via nitric oxide could cause false-negative rapid antigen test results. I reached out to ask about this 2 months ago and I haven’t gotten a response lol\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 4. Studies in test tubes/cell culture and why preventing infection in those contexts isn’t relevant to the human respiratory tract\n\nThis section is not an exhaustive list of all the studies I could find, just two examples so I can explain my point.\n\nBasically, adding nasal sprays or nasal spray ingredients to animal cells growing on the bottom of a cell culture dish is very different than spraying a nasal spray up a human’s nose. Cells in our nasal cavity help physically flush matter out of the nose and into the throat, ending with us swallowing the matter. In a cell culture flask, there is nowhere for the spray or spray ingredients to be flushed out. In a human, there are many types of cells throughout the respiratory tract, from the nose to lungs, that can be infected by the virus that causes COVID-19 (called SARS-CoV-2). In a cell culture dish, the nasal spray or nasal spray ingredients can interact with all of the cells that have the potential to be infected. In a human, nasal sprays don’t seem to cover even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see section 1 for references for this). As well, nasal sprays definitely don’t protect cells in the lungs from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nExamples of these studies:\n\n[Study 5](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202406348)\n\nthe Profi spray study\n\nJoseph J, Baby HM, Quintero JR, Kenney D, Mebratu YA, Bhatia E, Shah P, Swain K, Lee D, Kaur S, Li XL, Mwangi J, Snapper O, Nair R, Agus E, Ranganathan S, Kage J, Gao J, Luo JN, Yu A, Park D, Douam F, Tesfaigzi Y, Karp JM, Joshi N. Toward a Radically Simple Multi-Modal Nasal Spray for Preventing Respiratory Infections. Adv Mater. 2024 Nov;36(46):e2406348. doi: 10.1002/adma.202406348. Epub 2024 Sep 24. PMID: 39318086.\n\nIssues with study 5:\n\n* (Adapted from [this comment on PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/publications/2B49C5B4CC30DAB35CC61E1861CC25) and [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHzfvdyvJ9/?img_index=1) about this study)\n* Making multiple unsubstantiated statements and incorrectly citing papers that don’t provide evidence for what they’re saying\n   * Example 1: the authors state “Transmission of most respiratory pathogens predominantly occurs through inhalation of contaminated respiratory droplets and their subsequent deposition in the nasal cavity, which has an entry checkpoint.” and they cite [study N](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9149) for this. What does study N say you might ask? Something very different! Here are two quotes from study N: \"When unburdened by conventional definitions of transmission routes, the available evidence for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and other respiratory viruses is much more consistent with transmission by aerosols <100 μm rather than by rare, large droplets sprayed onto mucous membranes of people in very close proximity. Recent acknowledgement of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by the WHO (48) and US CDC (49) reinforces the necessity to implement protection against this transmission route at both short and long ranges.\" and \"Because viruses are enriched in small aerosols (<5 μm), they can travel deeper into and be deposited in the lower respiratory tract. The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be higher and the virus persists longer in the lower respiratory tract compared with the upper respiratory tract (164, 165). Initiation of an infection in the lower respiratory tract adds technical challenges in diagnosing patients because current screening commonly collects samples from the nasopharyngeal or oral cavity using swabs.\"\n   * Example 2: the authors state “The nasal cavity is a primary target for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to high expression of ACE2, which decreases towards the lower respiratory tract.\" There is no direct evidence that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects nasal cells (whether in the studies cited in that sentence, [study O](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/148517), [study P](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0868-6), [study Q](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766522), or elsewhere, such as [study E](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9) mentioned earlier)\n* No testing in humans\n* The one experiment in mice is not comparable to humans and is irrelevant. In this experiment, they physically placed drops of the nasal spray up the mice’s noses and then physically placed the influenza virus suspended in liquid. This is nothing like real-world human scenarios, where nasal sprays don’t coat the nasal cavity well and we breathe aerosols into our noses, mouths, throats and lungs\n* Issues with other experiments (see [my Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBHzfvdyvJ9/?img_index=1) for more info)\n* [Super misleading to the point of being untrue reporting about the study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/drug-free-nasal-spray-blocks-neutralizes-viruses-bacteria/) that the authors were involved in\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n[Study 6](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202008304)\n\nThe NoriZite gellan and carrageenan nasal spray study\n\nMoakes RJA, Davies SP, Stamataki Z, Grover LM. Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS-COV-2. Adv Mater. 2021 Jul;33(26):e2008304. doi: 10.1002/adma.202008304. Epub 2021 May 31. PMID: 34060150; PMCID: PMC8212080.\n\nIssues with study 6:\n\n* Similar to study 5 (the Profi nasal spray study) in that they make unsubstantiated claims\n   * Example 1: the authors say “From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS-CoV-2.” Stating “a fully preventative spray is formulated” is not true, as this study is not a human clinical trial, nor was the spray tested in a human nor was it tested in an animal.\n* Spray contains benzalkonium chloride (see section 1)\n\n# 5. Summary/TLDR and final thoughts\n\nUnfortunately, many people including covid influencers have fallen for the falsehood that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19. Some such influencers have promoted these nasal sprays for free and helped spread the misinformation that they prevent COVID-19. Unlike with nasal sprays, there is ample, sound evidence that high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification prevent COVID-19.\n\nThe human clinical trials testing whether or not nasal sprays prevent COVID-19 have major methodological issues, and to my knowledge there are only two (EDIT MARCH 15, 2025: and one of the two has now [been retracted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653222001809?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=920e1cfeecbf491d))! Please don't lower your covid precautions based on two (EDIT MARCH 15, 2025: one) low-quality, flawed human clinical trials, two low-quality, flawed human studies with no placebos and other misleading studies performed in test tubes! As time goes on, more concerns about these studies appear on PubPeer which sometimes triggers investigations of the studies and warnings to not treat the studies as reliable in the meantime. Most clinical trials looking at preventing COVID-19 with nasal sprays mysteriously [never published the results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww) (most likely, the results were not good so they didn’t publish them). In my (PhD biochemist who studied COVID-19) opinion, we have enough studies to reasonably conclude whether or not nasal sprays prevent COVID-19, and we may not get many new ones, because the evidence suggests that nasal sprays do not prevent COVID-19. However, as a scientist, I will continue to review any new studies and keep an open mind.\n\nWhile this post may be upsetting to read, false hope is dangerous. Well-fitting high-quality respirators, ventilation and air purification give me true hope. Many of these companies are [no longer allowed to claim that their sprays prevent COVID-19](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A) after warnings from the FDA. Let’s stop spreading dangerous misinformation and stop providing free advertising for these companies who have never proven their sprays prevent COVID-19! <3",

Furthermore, we are complicit in spreading dangerous misinformation, that also by implication, would jeopardize the safety and lives of others.  I am not an expert.  I don’t tell anyone to do anything.  I look at the research and see a low-risk prophylactic, that with the use of a respirator, may provide some benefits.\n\nSince you seem fine with casting moral aspersions and value judgments, I think it’s fair to question your hyperfixation on nasal sprays.  This isn’t your first time commenting on them.  I think you see a world where most people have given up masking, which is the best method for preventing COVID-19, and instead of seeing the promise of some nasal sprays, you associate them with the global hatred of masking.\n\nYour promotion of ventilation and air purification is a red herring to appeal to the COVID-conscious crowd here.  These can be great things but their effectiveness is extremely variable, ranging from substantially lowering the amount of respiratory particles in one environment or situation to having little benefit in another.  Here in the US, we don’t even try to improve air quality with existing tech where we know it can make a difference, even in high-risk places like pre-schools or physicians’ offices.  Public spaces basically have to all be treated as hazardous, and in them, I wouldn’t trust any air purification system as being built correctly, maintained properly, or effective enough to not wear a respirator.  Air purification is totally outside of my control other than in my home.  At least nasal sprays, with more research and development, might possibly give someone the ability to help protect themself when most other people have stopped caring to protect themselves and others.\n\nYou are much more qualified than I am to understand the research.  I’m skeptical of much of the nasal spray research as well.  I’m interested in looking more into what you posted.  I’m not married to nasal sprays.  I’ve considered stopping using the one I do use due to some of the very things you have pointed out.  But I do find other research persuasive enough for me to use one.\n\nIf you want to help people, I would recommend helping people understand risk compensation theory and how their choices regarding the use of nasal sprays may affect their overall precautions.

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

Like the several-years-kind-of a while. And I've tried, so SOOOOO many products. Benzoyl peroxide? HURT, redness, itchy! Made it sooo much worse. Salicylic acid? Multiple brands, curology included. Same story, it just didn't work. Clindamycin pledgets, worked for a bit, but eventually got worse. Hypochlorous acid? Drying. Didn't seem to do much. I even tried clorahexidine both in pledget form and HIBICLENS solution, this SEEMED to work temporarily, but I didn't want to use it long term because, well, you're really not supposed to, either way, still was battling active break outs. I had given up, I was sick of it. I also deal with terrible inflammatory acne on my face, and recently started a curology blend of topical spironolactone, clindamycin, and azalaic acid, we will see how that goes. But back to the body acne, I had given up. Well, I was at Walmart the other day looking for a body wash, when I stumbled across this bottle of Suave. \"Eliminates 99% of bacteria\", a hefty claim, and in a body wash form? I hadnt seen anything like it. And For three bucks, I figured, hell why not! I'll give it a shot.  Not expecting much I tossed it into my cart. I used it that evening and was surprised to find it was scented. I guess I had expected it to be fragrance free given it's clear color. Well after the first wash I noticed the redness had gone down. Odd, I thought, thinking maybe i was just being hopeful/delusional. Well it's been about 5 days of using this in the shower and my body acne? Nearly gone. All that remains are some sebum plugs that seem to come out more and more with each wash. I am dumbfounded, and kinda angry, how could this STUPID CHEAP BODY WASH DO WHAT EVERYTHING ELSS COULDN'T!?!? I looked into the active ingredient, Benzalkonium Chloride, 0.13%. Online this ingredient doesn't seem to have  good rapport. So why is this working?? Can someone help me figure this out I feel like I've lost my mind! It's not even as drying to my skin as benzoyl was, I can't make any sense of this. I have half a mind to use it on my face but I've held off so far. Can anyone help me make sense of this? Was it this simple all along???",

        "body": "This is such a relatable story!\n\nThere are several reasons why this might be working so well for you when other treatments failed:\n\n1. Your body acne was likely more complex than simple bacterial overgrowth. Benzalkonium chloride is uniquely broad spectrum,  it's antibacterial, antifungal, and can even tackle demodex mites. If you were dealing with fungal acne or a mixed population of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms, this would explain why single-target treatments like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid failed while this comprehensive approach succeeded.\n\n2. Some acne causing bacteria create protective biofilms that make them resistant to many treatments. BC is particularly effective at breaking down these biofilms, which could explain why other antimicrobials couldn't penetrate but this one could.\n\n3. You mentioned how harsh benzoyl was on your skin. When your skin barrier is compromised from irritation, it can make acne worse by increasing inflammation and making you more prone to infections. The suave wash disrupts bacterial cell membranes without the oxidizing mechanism of benzoyl (harsher way to kill bacteria), giving you antimicrobial benefits without the inflammatory damage.\n\n4. The overall pH and formulation of this body wash might be more compatible with your skin's natural barrier, and the other ingredients could be working synergistically with the BC.\n\nThe online negativity about BC is often about overuse in leave-on products, so in a wash-off format (at this concentration), it can be different. Your skin gets the broad spectrum antimicrobial benefit without prolonged exposure. Sometimes the simplest solutions really are the best ones, especially when they address multiple factors at once.\n\nAs always, take caution on trying the face. Now that you know this ingredient/formulation works for you, I would more suggest finding a product formulated for the face that contains it. I believe neutrogena has some face washes? Though I believe salicyclic acid is touted as the main active ingredient, so you would have to tolerate that also.",

Let’s rate over 30 nasal sprays by product name and ingredient!\n\n*Do a ctrl-F for nasal spray names/ingredients to see the issues with the study (or whether or not there even is a study on it). And please leave a comment if you know another brand name of a particular spray, I will edit the post to add it :).*\n\n**About me:** I have a PhD in biochemistry and one of my PhD projects was on COVID-19. I have extensive experience critically reviewing published studies, and my PhD supervisor was very impressed by my skills in this area. I have worked with scientific journals as a peer reviewer since 2018.\n\n**The main takeaway of this post is that there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.**\n\n**Thus, nasal sprays should:**\n\n* **not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators (that haven’t had too many hours of wear time, see** [**my post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/) **debunking the idea that N95s are super protective for 40 hours of wear time), ventilation and air purification**\n* **not be considered to lower the infectivity of someone with COVID-19 in any meaningful way**\n* **not be considered to help people with COVID-19 recover more quickly**\n\n**Comment note:** There is so much misinformation about nasal sprays out there. If you comment something that is misinformation or misleading, I will start off my comment with “This comment is misinformation” or “This comment is misleading”, to make it really clear to anyone reading it. If it appears like you didn’t read the post and consider the information from the post, I will also include something like “It seems like you didn’t read this post and consider its contents before disagreeing, therefore it’s hard to imagine that your opinion is valuable”. If you do not wish to have these things said to you, please try to fact-check the things you’re saying, and please read the post in its entirety and consider everything presented here before commenting. We all wish nasal sprays prevented and treated COVID-19. It is upsetting that the current evidence suggests that they don’t, especially when so many people spread the misinformation that they do. If this brings up feelings of sadness or anger, please try to realize that you are sad/mad at someone other than me, and please don’t take it out on me.\n\nWith that all out of the way, let’s get into a table of contents:\n\n1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n4. How do the current clinical trials stack up?\n5. How do nasal sprays without clinical trials stack up?\n6. FDA warnings\n7. Takeaways/TLDR\n\n# 1. Brief overview of issues with the studies\n\nGenerally, there is strong evidence that certain nasal spray ingredients prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. The quality of this data depends on the methods used in the study (ex: checking if the ingredient(s) affect the viability of the cells you’re using, quantifying SARS-CoV-2 infection in ways that don’t rely on RT-PCR when you haven’t demonstrated that the ingredient(s) don’t interfere with PCRs, etc.).\n\nHowever, a nasal spray in a human nose is a very different scenario than a nasal spray in cell culture. Unlike in cell culture, mucus, etc. is flushed out of the nose and swallowed in a matter of hours. As well, it is easy to expose all cells in cell culture to a nasal spray, whereas nasal sprays sprayed in a human nose tend not to cover even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see the third to last bullet point below). Add to that the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity, and you can see why, thus far, the evidence suggests that nasal sprays don’t prevent COVID-19.\n\nIn the case of having COVID-19, if nasal sprays were able to lower viral load in the nose (which remains to be seen, as the current studies have major methodological issues as described in the bullet points below and in section 4), it is unclear how meaningful that is in terms of lowering how infectious someone is. Again, this is because SARS-CoV-2 infects cells outside of the nasal cavity and nasal sprays don’t even tend to coat the nasal cavity well.\n\nList of general issues with these studies (modified from my post entitled “[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)”):\n\n* The fact that the test spray and not the placebo spray often contain ingredients that are known to interfere with PCR tests, and many of these studies rely on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests from nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs (aka swabs from where the nasal sprays are sprayed). This is almost always combined with no information on the timing between applying nasal sprays and taking swabs. This means that the test spray could cause false-negative COVID-19 tests and/or viral load values that are lower than the true values\n   * Ex: both a carrageenan ([study A](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913533/)) and a heparin ([study B](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38649069/)) nasal spray can cause false-negative COVID-19 RT-PCR tests\n* Lack of placebo spray\n* Lack of sufficient information for reproducibility (especially regarding what is considered a positive and a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test result)\n* In prevention studies: lack of testing for asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections (how can we say something prevents COVID-19 if we aren’t testing for asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 infections?)\n* Inappropriate COVID-19 testing methods\n* Wide 95 % confidence intervals for relative risk reductions (see section 2 for a definition), reductions in viral load and symptom improvements\n* The group promised a follow-up study with more participants and the trial was completed but the results were never posted (suggesting that the results did not show the test spray preventing COVID-19)\n   * Ex: in [study C](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-022-06685-z) a protocol was published for an upcoming carrageenan nasal spray clinical trial, and that trial finished in 2022 but the [results haven’t been posted](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04590365?term=NCT04590365&rank=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaazwtXy-AS4JIQcaCCFdLUKzt9K2o3qNww5bkapp7Y8-TxUDmI-EBKjdAk_aem_UhX-7Nu_JhiXcWir4xMcZQ). Generally, if you do a search on [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/) with [the condition “COVID” and the intervention/treatment “nasal spray”](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=COVID&intr=Nasal%20spray&limit=25&page=1&fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAabmmuQEJwHXGg_TlYJCmer9RsT4Fv9GzluPIrNli_IsCfBvmZeTwgCzPAE_aem__l8QUba6qzYbAkDseiH6Ww), you find 44 studies where only 4 have the status “completed with results”, 16 are “completed without results”, 9 have “unknown status” and 6 are “withdrawn” or “terminated”\n* Many nasal spray companies having to majorly walk back false claims of their sprays preventing COVID-19 after warning letters from the FDA (link [here](https://cen.acs.org/materials/biomaterials/biopolymers-behind-multimodal-nasal-spray/102/i30?fbclid=PAY2xjawHhEZJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABplkfYWLZPD8ITdJAqsUTqxr67H1D2FkJFkPrLaocxpnJaDTELpo5_DeWpA_aem_J_1hkkM1nXJ9SpZptQHA8A), ignore the Profi nasal spray praise, see my other post entitled \"[There is no convincing evidence that nasal sprays prevent COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1iv64oi/there_is_no_convincing_evidence_that_nasal_sprays/)” for issues with the Profi study). Also see section 6 for more info on FDA warnings\n* False claims that we mainly contract COVID-19 through nose cells (and not lung cells) with either no citation or citation of papers that don’t prove that (such as [study D](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30675-9))\n* Lack of acknowledgement that the location in the respiratory tract that aerosols end up is determined by their size (aka a nasal spray will not prevent the sizes of aerosols that end up in your lungs from going into your lungs), see Figure 3 and all the studies referenced in that figure in [study E](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-022-00506-7)\n* Not everyone breathes through their nose\n* Nasal sprays are flushed out of the nasal cavity in a matter of hours\n* Nasal sprays don’t appear to coat even 50 % of the nasal cavity (see [study F](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21499839/), [study G](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2014.931566), [study H](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12383290/))\n* Many of these sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which have harmful effects at the concentrations used in nasal sprays in some studies (see [study I](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11575893/) and [study J](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028024/) and references therein)\n* None of these sprays have long-term safety data on their regular (repeated) use\n* The sizes of aerosols that would end up deposited in your nose are very efficiently filtered by high-quality respirators such as N95s, provided that the N95 is sealed to your face and the seal doesn’t break. This is even true for a respirator with a lot of wear time (see my previous post on some studies looking at the effects of wear time on N95 fit and filtration efficiency [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroCovidCommunity/comments/1hnxlns/debunking_the_myth_that_n95s_are_super_protective/), again, provided that it stays sealed). This is because the filtration mechanisms that act on the sizes of aerosols that get deposited in your nose do not degrade with wear time (whereas the filtration mechanisms that act on smaller aerosols do degrade with wear time). Thus, while wearing a sealed N95, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the environment should not be deposited in your nose anyway\n\n# 2. What would good methods look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nPlacebo\n\n* A test spray and a placebo spray, where the placebo spray lacks the one important test ingredient only\n* Participants being assigned the test spray or the placebo randomly and not knowing which one they got\n* Researchers analyzing the data not knowing who got the placebo and who got the test spray\n* Approximately equal numbers of people getting the test spray and the placebo spray\n\nTesting\n\n* Periodic testing for all participants, regardless of symptoms (to pick up asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections in prevention studies, and to get viral load data for many timepoints in treatment studies)\n* Testing whether or not the spray ingredients affect viral load measurements or the COVID-19 test results. And either showing that it doesn’t, or taking steps to minimize the effects and quantifying the effects (referred to as interference testing, *this has never been done in any of the current studies*)\n* High sensitivity testing method\n* Relevant testing method given the experimental circumstances\n\nAnalysis/reporting\n\n* Analyzing and reporting on data from all of the participants\n* Sticking to running analyses that they decided on before the trial\n* Only making statements about differences between the test group and the placebo group if the differences are statistically significant\n* Representing the results in a way that isn’t misleading\n* Appropriate analysis methods\n\n# 3. What would good results look like for these kinds of clinical trials?\n\nFor preventing COVID-19:\n\n* The relative risk reduction (a measure of how much being on the test spray compared to the placebo spray lowered the chance of testing positive for COVID-19) would be a high percentage and the 95 % confidence interval for the relative risk reduction would be a small range of percentages\n   * Example: a relative risk reduction of 80 % where the 95 % confidence interval for that value is 70-90 %\n\nFor treating people with COVID-19:\n\n* Over time, the viral load would be reduced in those on the test spray more than those on the placebo spray (with a 95 % confidence interval for that reduction not too wide)\n* People on the test spray would recover faster than people on the placebo (with a 95 % confidence interval for that difference not too wide)\n\nNote: having enough participants influences the stats associated with the results, so that important quality of a clinical trial is accounted for here.\n\n# 4.

Takeaways/TLDR\n\n**Main takeaway (repeated from the beginning): there is no sound evidence that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.**\n\n**Thus, nasal sprays should:**\n\n* **not be used for COVID-19 prevention in place of effective measures such as high-quality well-fitting respirators, ventilation and air purification**\n* **not be considered to lower the infectivity of someone with COVID-19 in any meaningful way**\n* **not be considered to help people with COVID-19 recover more quickly**\n\nTLDR and things to consider:\n\n* Sadly, there are no high-quality clinical trials showing that nasal sprays prevent nor treat COVID-19.\n* No study has done the obvious and necessary experiment: determining whether or not the spray interferes with the test used to obtain the results of the study. This is especially concerning because many of these sprays contain one or more ingredients known to interfere with the tests used in the studies. This is a major issue, because the sprays are sprayed in the nose and the swabs are taken from the nose or from the nose, mouth and throat. It is unusual for such basic and necessary experiments to be missing from a scientific article. This would even be unusual for studies from several decades ago.\n* There is no long-term safety data for regular (repeated) use of any of these nasal sprays, and not even short-term safety data for some. For some sprays, the evidence suggests they aren’t even safe for short-term use ([study 19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72262-w)).\n* Nasal sprays should not be referred to as a layer of protection against COVID-19, as such statements are not based in science.\n* Any COVID-19 accounts promoting nasal sprays for preventing or treating COVID-19 are not being responsible, whether or not they have the experience/knowledge to critically review these studies. We can’t just repeat what others are saying, we need to fact-check things and be science-based.\n\nSigned, a PhD biochemist with extensive experience critically reviewing published studies and who cares about people and their safety <3\n\nP.S. Please see the **comment note** near the beginning. To summarize, I will be clearly pointing out if your comment: is misleading, contains misinformation, or if it demonstrates that you didn’t read the post. It would benefit us all to not believe and spread misinformation about nasal sprays and COVID-19!",

Everything is based on a hypothesis and uncertainty. So what are we supposed to do, nothing?\n\n\nThere's a point where academic evidence is no longer useful.  We look at the totality of less than great evidence, we look at anecdotes, we look for signals of efficacy and potential risks, we make the best risk benefit analysis we can under the circumstances, and we engage in self experimentation(ideally under the care of a doctor who is *practicing* medicine)...because that's literally all we have for covid.\n\n\nThe one thing I do agree with you on is that these nasal sprays cannot and should not be relied on to prevent infection.",

        "body": "So as someone with a science background as well: to the extent that your criticisms of these studies, I feel that you are taking an approach of similar magnitude in the opposite direction of the papers you are critiquing, and taking a more black and white approach (which can be valuable in science) but that isn't helpful for real life. I also find it interesting/problematic that while in academic science, people tend you use more conditional language when presenting evidence in either direction, you are here stating things with much more certainty than your own evidence warrants. \n\nSkepticism in science is a great thing, but your title is somewhat click-baity and some of what you say can also be misleading to a layman who doesn't have an understanding of academic science. Nasal sprays don't prevent or treat COVID, but they could potentially lower viral load and prevent a more severe outcome. To not look at this aspect and only criticize them for not 100% preventing covid in a post for the general public is anywhere between unintentionally misguided or outright disingenuous. I of course don't know your intentions, but Reddit isn't academia where you do a meta-analysis of papers on one specific issue and people understand that it is an exact point you're trying to disprove. I think the vast majority of us here are already not using nasal sprays as a sole preventative measure - it's a precaution I take when I need to get on an airplane and I've weighed potential known/unknown risks of sprays vs. risk of getting covid. At no point do yiu address this aspect of it. \n\nSecondly, absence of evidence =/= evidence of absence. Covid is incredibly new if we use a scientific timeline. Culture wars and general disinterest over the fact that the pandemic is \"over\" mean that people aren't studying covid as much now. There's still an incredible dearth of information around bigger issues of covid. There aren't even that many papers on novavax. So while there are issues with the papers thst do exist on nasal sprays, i think waiting for evidence to prove they are useful before actually using them in a circumstance as an additional precaution means you could be missing out on potential protection as well. How are we going to find people to do RCTs on nasal sprays when covid is \"over\"? Sure, on an academic level, let's not do something until we have evidence it works. In real life, well what are the risks of iota-carageenan potentially helping compared to potentially cstching covid? I think as irresponsible as it is, as you say, to recommend sprays when there could be issues with safety, it's also as irresponsible to advocate for not using them when they could be helping. I recognize the safety risks, and you analyze each study, and then at the end talk about there being safety issues with certain sprays, but then you blanket suggest not using nasal sprays, when the different sprays very likely have different safety profiles. You critique each individual study, but you don't present evidence where you actually look at each individual spray's issues vs. risks and do that kind of cost benefit analysis. In a academic setting, this is not necessary, but on Reddit, I think it's problematic to go so deep in one direction without looking at the other side. \n\nI think as much as there are criticisms around the studies that do exist around nasal sprays, it is also highly problematic to be stating the things you say them, with the amount of authority that you do. You are a single person with a PhD in biochem, and to a layman, that might seems like you are more of an expert, but as someone that also has a scientific background, and is a science educator, I find your analysis is problematic in the ways I've stated. I appreciate that you want to warn people that there really isn't solid evidence out there - however, you're in a way making recommendations that you don't necessarily have evidence for either. And you're communicating in a way that presents your own evidence as stronger than it is as well, and presenting it in a way that actively discourages the average person without a scientific background from using sprays because of a dearth of evidence, instead of presenting the evidence neutrally and saying \"look, there's no evidence of them preventing covid, but there could still be potential benefits the scientific community isn't aware of that could impact covid outcomes\" - you're not a doctor, so present the evidence neutrally and let people make the choice for themselves. \n\nOverall, I think, if you are coming from a good place, you are overapplying academic science to the realities of real world. As I have said, reddit isn't academia and so the perspective we take when assessing precautions shouldn't be the same perspective as one would take from an academic approach. But the other thing is that science is just as much about the content as it is about communication. If you are not able to effectively communicate the meaning behind your message, then your science is moot. Again, I'm not sure if you've worded things the way you have because you are set out to disprove nasal sprays or just because you're not aware of how to communicate science outside of an academic context, but your post is problematic to me as someone that is also able to evaluate scientific evidence critically.\n\nEta: I'll also add that as someone who went from really believing in the rigours of science and looked down on things without scientific evidence, to becoming disabled by multiple medical conditions, science isn't the be all end all. Anecdata from patients with my conditions about random supplements or treatments that have no formal evidence and are not used at all in clinical medicine (which I tried when medical interventions failed), have often ended up helping me much more than many of the scientifically tested medications that were associated with clinically and statistically significant improvements in their patient populations. Obviously this is a separate issue because pharmacokinetics/dynamics are much more person-dependent than the human-to-human variance that might come from a nasal spray, but my point is that even if there isn't scientific evidence for something, it doesn't mean that it can't be helpful. I'd love to see more studies on nasal sprays with larger sample sizes - but I'm not going to wait around for science to tell me something is helpful before I try it. In this case, I do a risk-benefit assessment and choose the spray that has lower risks and use it as an extra precaution with masking when I go to higher risk situations, because the potential risks of carrageenan are lower to me than the state I'll be in after another covid infection when I already have long covid.",

As a fellow PhD chemist I did similar analysis for local covid conscious friends and urged caution especially if folks wanted to rely on nasal sprays as an alternative to masking. \n\n1) I have another nasal spray that isn't mentioned in this post, brand name Norizite, sold by Birmingham Biotech. Its effectiveness is based on the following study: https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202008304\n\n2) Another flaw I identified fairly early on in many COVID related research studies is sample size and diversity in human trials (notably many on the effectiveness of masking, which suffer the opposite problem to above, where in fact masking is MORE effective than the study shows because many people in the study are masking improperly) I can't remember the sample sizes of the above nasal spray studies although I did read and criticise most of them, I do remember many of them had small sample sizes (less than 1000 and in some cases less than 100 participants) I also wonder about the location/occupation and other covid risk factors of the study participants and how that could introduce flaws in tbe studies. For example, many studies of mask efficiency were of healthcare workers who have a much higher risk of exposure to covid due to their jobs, but also may have access to other PPE, may only wear masks at work but not in their personal lives, etc. Any comments on this would be most welcome!",

    "body": "Edit -> I received a call at 7:23 PM Eastern today (Tue) from the GM informing me that they had placed me on 30 day unpaid leave. \n\nDocuments relating to this post:\n\n[A public announcement from the CEO of Lowes  posted April 2nd.](https://newsroom.lowes.com/inside-lowes/lowes-responding-covid-19-essential-retailer/)\n\n[Oregon Executive Order 20-12](https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-12.pdf)\n\n[The Letter of Resignation that was presented to me and I’d begun to fill out.](https://i.imgur.com/4Lehtc2.jpg)\n\nI have been an employee at the 11th Avenue Lowes in Eugene, Oregon for about two months, beginning my employment there as an outside garden loader a short time before this crisis really began to unfold. Over the course of the past week I have witnessed regular, habitual disregard towards proper sanitation and social distance practices. These include instances which I believed violated the spirit of executive order 20-12 but also ones which simply contradicted public statements of Lowes efforts to protect its customers and associates made by CEO Marvin Ellison. In noticing these things I made my best efforts to document them, explain my concerns, print the relevant internal documentation and highlight parts of e.o 20-12 and our CEO’s statements in order to show where we could make efforts to better meet their expectations both to the letter of the word and in good faith common sense efforts.\n\n\nAt approximately 2:00 PM yesterday I was brought into the training room with the store manager, one assistant manager, and a department manager and offered a letter of resignation.  I was told by the GM that it was apparent that I had “absolutely no faith in our efforts here” and that their offer was I could sign the letter of resignation and willfully terminate my employment, and then I could draw unemployment. The GM then continued to state that the alternative was I would be placed on a zero-hour leave, punctuating that point by stating that it would mean I would have no source of income. While I have had no further contact with the store, it seems this means I am currently still employed and appointed to zero-hours.\n\nAt no point before this have I received any warning against my conduct nor have I ever faced any disciplinary action. In fact, I have believed that my conversations with the GM, my direct manager, and another department manager of the store had resulted in them understanding at least some of my concerns and that they would be addressed. When each day that I came in for my shifts and I witnessed the same problems, I simply continued to document them and explain why I felt they were in violation of the letter and spirit of these public and internal ordinances and bring that information again to these managers. When in instances these were things that I perceived to be immediately dangerous I did take the initiative to inform other associates, such as how non-alcoholic benzalkodium chloride hand sanitizer are not effective against Covid-19.\n\nHere is a summary of my concerns, and what I asked them to do to assuage them:\n\n1. Social Distancing Guidelines at both a locally legislated level and the actions being touted by our CEO are not being enforced. While six foot distance markers have been placed at registers, egress into the store is not managed in any meaningful ways. Customers are congregating to socialize at our entrances. They are also making use of our display patio furniture at such a high volume that it is essentially a public sitting area which we have made no attempts to sanitize or limit access to. It should be noted however that instructions to block off the display furniture had came down the internal pipelines yesterday, so maybe they’ll finally do it. (While writing this a co-worker informed me they have now been sectioned off. Yay!)\n\n2. We have inadequate sanitation practices. \nAs of over a week ago we have entirely ran out of alcohol based cleaning solutions. Bottles of non-alcoholic sanitizers with the sole active ingredient of Benzalkonium Chloride have been provided to associates for personal use and been left at work terminals and these have been touted as effective against the Covid-19 virus despite that being easily shown to be false. After I had shown several members of management this information they began to state that the bottles also contained a percentage of alcohol, one manager quoting an 80% content and one who helped escort me from the store quoting 40%. When I asked if he could in any way verify that claim, he told me to stop playing games and just to leave. -------- We have Hepestat 256 but we are not able to follow its instructions by allowing it to sit for a meaningful length of time. At each register you will find a purple spray bottle and one or two microfiber cloths. The first days we had directly sprayed the card terminals and registers but since some electronic failures we have switched to wiping with the microfiber cloths. These clothes are not being managed to maintain their sanitation except to be periodically gathered up and replaced. They are used indiscriminately between wiping carts, registers, and other various surfaces and then haphazardly draped over the bottle or tossed under registers until their next use. Many have survived over multiple days.\n\n\n3. As per CEO Marvin Ellisons statement on April 2nd Lowes has publicly announced that our stores will have all appointed Social Distance Ambassadors to control customer egress and flow through the store. We also have received a new application on our handheld devices which would allow us to count access to the store. After asking about our store’s efforts to adhere to this I was informed that it was decided our stores capacity would be 500 people, and that since we had not approached those numbers even before the crisis, we would not need to follow these guidelines. ----- When I asked how that number (500) was determined I was given conflicting answers by the GM - that it was generated based on our square footage, then that it was determined from above his head, then that the application was broken and unusable. I was able to access the application on a phone and could see it functioned just fine, with it being a simple shared counter that allowed an administrator to set a maximum number and tally incoming and outgoing customers until it reached it. The application has since been disabled from being accessed by non-management, and when it’s attempted to be used, states that access is unauthorized. ----- On April 5th we continued with our “Spring Black Friday” sale. I witnessed an older customer, well into his eighties, bring the advertisement behind the plexiglass barrier to show the cashier. He leaned into the cashier, bringing their faces together, and only reluctantly stepped back when I requested he do so. The next day, that employee went home sick one hour into his shift. Only minutes later, I witnessed a loader placing bags of mulch into the back of a customer’s vehicle while working shoulder-to-shoulder with that customer. When I explained to them both that we still had to maintain the six-foot rule while loading, and that either one of us loaders could finish (with me offering to), or the customer could complete the load. The customer aggressively asked if I had been tested for the virus, and when I said I hadn’t he claimed that he had been and the test had came up negative. They finished loading side-by-side, the customer muttering angrily about me the entire time. Management at every level of the store is aware that interactions like this are occurring by the minute within our store, and don’t feel any obligation to prevent them.\n\n4. Our communication is poor. Associates come into the store for their shifts and are immediately sent to their posts. Any information they receive about local or internal expectations and efforts regarding Covid-19 responses are received by casual, hearsay word-of-mouth. It was two days after the April 2nd announcement before it seemed everyone knew they were going to earn $2 an hour more, but a week later and no one seemed to be aware of other aspects of that same public announcement such as the promise of appointing social distancing ambassadors and setting a customer limit. On Saturday April 4th when I started my shift I was prevented by the GM of the store from accessing the training computers and instructed to go directly to my post. Employees should be educated and kept up to date with these measures, and impressed upon that many of them are expected.\n\nSince I am meandering a bit I would like to complete this post with a quick overview of the sort of actions I had been proposing to management, which I had impressed upon them I would like to be seen done sooner than later. Some are common sense, easily dealt with issues and others are a little tougher but still both reasonable and the right thing to do. Others I still believe they have no intention to address, or will continue to avoid until the absolutely last moment. This list is in essence what I most often presented to the management.\n\n\n1. Set a customer limit to the store based on CDC guidelines, local legislation, or preferably determined by appraising the actions of similar stores located in states which are currently being more harshly affected by the virus. As part of this and further complying with our public statements, I would like the appointing of social distance ambassadors who can ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines and protect cashiers against non-compliant customers. Our internal memos also mention appointing an ambassador in outside lawn and garden to monitor customer flow there.\n\n\n2. Since we do not have access to Covid-19 appropriate personal sanitizers, particularly at Lumber and Outside Lawn and Garden, the establishment of hand washing stations at these entrances. Better yet, appointing these areas as outgoing traffic only and managing egress through the front entrance.\n\n3. More conscientious cart management. Reduce the number of circulating carts to a reasonable level based on our calculating customer limit and establish a two-stage sanitation routine. Since we’re using Hepestat 256 carts should be sprayed and quarantined for 10 minutes before being brought forward for customer use. Novelty carts such as the large blue racecars that can seat two children should be pulled from circulation.\n\n4. Regular safety meetings regarding our companies evolving policies, reassuring cashiers of their rights and responsibilities to maintain 6ft distance, education on how they can use the sick days provided by the company when they feel like they’re starting to feel sick so that they are not so stressed about requesting to leave. Currently meetings are only held at 8:00 A.M. and for any who came in afterwards they go straight to their register or department. I was in fact discouraged from taking time to access weekly playbook documents because we were so busy from our Spring Black Friday Sale. When I expressed my concerns that I’d like to know our new policies, I was told by the GM that it was more important that I be outside. When he came out a half hour later, it turns out we had had new policies enacted, and I had been violating them.\n\n5. Establish a limit of two customers per party. We have had far too many large groups and families which require customers to violate the six foot rule simply to move past. When these groups congregate in between paint and customer’s service, they often do so without regard for the six foot rule. Furthermore, casual non-essential shopping should be discouraged by asking that customers come to the store with a shopping list. Shoppers who are casually browsing should be asked to leave and return after they’ve determined what they wish to purchase. I have been told repeatedly by customers they are simply there to kill time. The GM of the store has also stated to me that he believes this is a part of our essential service to the community, to preserve a feeling of “normalcy” in his words. I would like for this perspective of the situation to be discouraged entirely. To be clear, it is the GM's opinion that because we are being allowed to stay open as an essential business that every aspect of our business is essential. Furthering that logic, since it is his belief that part of our business services is providing members of our community, particularly older members of the community, with a place to congregate and feel at ease that this is in fact a continued part of the essential services we provide. How obviously this contradicts the intent of being designated as essential shouldn't need much explanation.\n\nSo why am I making this post? I have just one request from everyone. If you shop at the 11th Ave. Lowes look to see if you believe they are holding themselves to the standards expected of them outlined in both e.o. 20-12 and from Lowes own publicly announced intentions. If you believe they are making a good faith, reasonable effort to uphold their responsibilities in curbing the spread of this disease please treat them kindly, keep your distance, be incredibly patient and mention your cashier by name on your receipt survey. I ask you to please stop coming in without being confident about what you're shopping for and particularly stop coming in day after day just to buy a couple things at a time for an evolving project. Take some time to really determine what you'll need.\n\nFinally if you go there and it seems their efforts are continuing to be lackluster - if you see something, say something. It may be that my intentions and interpretations of the situation have been misguided, but I sincerely don't believe so. Stay safe out there.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

If fact, it got worse, a lot worse. They did give me prescription lidocaine  ointment for the pain and that was good, though difficult to apply. It was so painful I was crying while applying it. \n\nBut the problem itself wasn't healing.  I had what I then thought were blisters and signs of infection. So my regular GP referred me to a dermatologist and called their office herself while I was there to arrange an emergency appointment for the next day. She told them she'd never seen anything like it in 30 years of practice. \n\nThe dermatologist office is about a 15 min walk from my place and normally I would walk it easily. By this time though, I could not walk due to the pain. My sister drove 45 minutes from her house to pick me up and drive me (5 minute drive) to the dermotologist office.\n\nAs soon as the Derm looked at it she asked me if I use a hygienic rinse  in my laundry. \n\nAnd yes, I have used Canesten Hygenic Laundry Rinse for around 10 years.  She told me I have  Granular Parakeratosis from the active ingredient in the rinse aid -  benzalkonium chloride (BAC).\n\nShe told me to  throw away the Canesten Laundry Rinse as well as anything else with benzalkonium chloride in it. She told me to rewash with an extra rinse all my clothes, towels, linen, everything. Obviously it stays in the fabric.\n\nI can see now it started with my underwear,  yoga pants and jeans, all washed with a capful of Canesten.\n\nThe Derm said she had seen more cases of this in the last few years - sudden sensitivity to benzalkonium chloride. It's also in the Dettol spray and wipe I used to clean with and apparently some hand sanitisers, even some cosmetics. \n\nThe blisters were not blisters, but dermatitis plaques. They have started to heal now but are still  painful.  The redness is fading too - 9 days  after I threw out everything containing BAC and rewashed everything that touches my skin.  \n\nI wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy, so FWIW here's a jourmal [article](https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/granular-parakeratosis-secondary-to-benzalkonium-chloride-exposure-from-common-household-laundry-rinse-aids) about Granular Parakeritosis and laundry rinse aids.\n\nThanks again.",

After two weeks it was soo angry had started to spread up and down my abdomen and arms - it was red/raw, leathery, peeling in chunks, itchy and incredibly painful. Sleeping was soo hard! I went to another GP and they said they had never seen something soo bad and said they thought it was eczema that got a bacterial infection but didn’t know for sure and referred me to a dermatologist. Thankfully the dermatologist knew exactly what it was and even asked what I wash my clothes with - canestan wash of course. I’ve been using it for 6+ years in every single load of washing. He told me to buy new clothes as it’s soo hard to get out of your clothes (needs 10+ washes). That’s an expensive endeavour so I might just start with bras, underwear (as I fear getting this type of rash down there) and a few new tops.

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere.

    "body": "Here's my \"preservation nerd\" reasons why:\n\nThe primary active chemical in Wet & Forget is benzalkonium chloride (BAC). When BAC interacts with environmental salts or moisture, it can lead to salt crystallization inside the stone. This damages the stone from within and causes flaking, cracking, or delamination. \nBAC is a surfactant which means it changes how water and contaminants interact with the stone surface. This can affect how moisture evaporates, leading to trapped water and biological regrowth-within the stone. In historic preservation, one of the key principles is reversibility—you shouldn't use anything that can't be undone. BAC isn't easily removed once applied, violating this principle.\n\nOn the other hand, D/2 contains non-ionic surfactants, meaning it cleans without changing the surface chemistry of the stone. It’s also pH-neutral, so it won’t etch, corrode, or chemically alter fragile stone types like marble, limestone, or sandstone. D/2 can be fully rinsed away with water and doesn’t leave behind harmful residues or salts. That means it follows the preservation principle of reversibility. \nD/2 is biodegradable, non-toxic, and safe for nearby grass and plants when used correctly. ",

Are there secondary ingredients in the W&F formula that would cause that behavior? Why would D/2 be able to be fully rinsed away but Wet & Forget would not be? Part of the point of D/2's \"no rinse\" method that it stays on and isn't removed, just like W&F.

    "body": "I'm someone who is deeply interested in the ingredients used in personal care products (especially baby products). I recently took a list of 40+ (I lost track at some point) of the most popular baby wipes and looked at every single one of the ingredients. I cross-referenced medical journals, studies, and databases from the EU and US to analyze the ingredients.\n\n﻿If you're interested, you can find the [full list of 40+ baby wipes and their ingredients](https://glowingnest.com/baby-wipes/) analyzed here and ranked from best to worst. \n\n﻿Here's what I found:\n\n**There's no such thing as \"biodegradable\" baby wipes:** This one bummed me out. While a lot of wipes say they're biodegradable, because of the way landfills are designed (a lack of oxygen, light and moisture﻿﻿﻿—crucial components of decomposition) they won't break down in any reasonable amount of time. And they won't break down in the sewer, either.\n\n﻿**Never flush baby wipes**: Even if the wipes say they're flushable, don't flush them.﻿﻿ Ever heard of a fatberg? They're a huge mass of grease, hair, dental floss wipes, etc. that combine into a huge mass in the sewer system. They recently pulled a [40 ton fatberg out of the London sewer system](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/bus-sized-fatberg-cleared-from-london-sewer). Please don't flush wipes.\n\n﻿**Materials used:** Most brands disclose the material used in the wipes, but many do not.\n\nThe four main materials wipes are made of are:\n\n* **Polypropylene** is essentially plastic—the same plastic used in most disposable diapers.\n* **Polyester** is also plastic.\n* **Viscose** is made from wood pulp. This wood pulp is highly processed and often bleached, but is better than polypropylene and polyester.\n* **Cotton** has started to find its way into the baby wipes market with newer brands. Some brands even use organic cotton.\n\n﻿**Ingredients to avoid in baby wipes:**\n\nThe following list of ingredients should be avoided when shopping for baby wipes. Our listings make sure that none of these ingredients exist in the product. If they do, they will receive a bad rating.\n\n* **Polysorbate 20** – Treated with ethelyne oxide, which can be contaminated with 1,4 dioxane, a highly toxic chemical that is linked to organ toxicity and cancer.\n* **Parabens** – Toxic preservatives that have been linked to breast cancer, hormonal disruption and skin irritation. Anything ending in “-paraben” such as *methylparaben*, *ethylparaben* and *butylparaben* is included.\n* **Phenoxyethanol** – Considered to be a less toxic preservative, but still linked to skin irritation and eczema.\n* **Sodium Benzoate** – A chemical preservative that’s inconclusively safe. Studies have linked the chemical to ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) but that likely only applies to sodium benzoate when used as a food preservative. It’s also controversial due to its ability to turn into toxic benzene when mixed with ascorbic acid (a derivative of vitamin C).\n* **Fragrance** – Seeing *fragrance* on a label is never a good thing. This is used as an umbrella term used for hundreds of chemicals that don’t need to be disclosed. It’s also often mixed with phthalates—linked with endocrine disruption, lowered sperm counts in males, and thyroid disorders in females.\n* **Propylene glycol** – A petroleum-based chemical typically linked with skin irritation and kidney issues when used internally. While this compound is broken down in the body, infants’ ability to do this is much lower than an adult. Because of this, we believe avoiding this chemical is better.\n* **Polyethylene glycol (PEG)** – Petroleum-based penetration enhancer that can be contaminated with  1,4-dioxane, a possible human carcinogen and ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen. Anything that starts with “PEG-” is included.\n* **Triclosan** – Another preservative linked to endocrine disruption, eye and skin irritation, and is very toxic to aquatic organisms.\n* **Tocopheryl acetate** – This is a synthetic version of vitamin E, used as a preservative in skincare. The issue is that it’s sometimes contaminated with  hydroquinone, a skin-lightening agent that’s banned in the UK, EU, Japan and Australia. This chemical is a skin irritant and possible carcinogen.\n\n**Note on preservatives:** While it's easy to hate on preservatives, in some products—like baby wipes—they're crucial. I found one brand that uses no preservatives at all (Dyper) and I could never recommend them for that reason. Baby wipes are essentially water and paper, which is a breeding ground for bacteria and mold when no preservatives are used. If a brand doesn't list any preservative, it either means they aren't using any, or they're not disclosing the ones they *are* using, which is a bad sign.\n\n﻿**Beware of WaterWipes:** WaterWipes are a popular brand amongst health-conscious mamas because they advertise themselves as being just \"*water and grapefruit seed extract*\". However, in 2020 they changed the ingredient listing to include \"﻿*trace of benzalkonium chloride*\" as a preservative. This is a well-recognized irritant and contact allergen, and therefore I'd recommend other brands over WaterWipes.\n\n﻿Let me know if you want me to do any other guides.",

Parabens have been proven to be safe when used in the correct concentrations and are the best preservatives for water-based products. \n\nPhenoxyethanol, when used as a preservative in certain concentrations is no longer linked to irritation (skin and eye products). \n\nAnecdotally, water wipes were recommended to us both at the hospital and by the lactation consultant and are the only wipes that don’t cause diaper rash in my baby. \n\nBenzalkonium chloride is used extensively as a disinfectant in many products, especially right now as it is effective at fighting the virus that causes COVID-19.

After everyone had been indulging in snacks and good company, we put my son to bed. He went down normally, not signalling illness in any way.\n\nAbout an hour later, my wife heard some strange noises through the monitor and went to investigate. As it turned out, he was in the middle of a febrile seizure. She reacted, I had a buddy call 911 and it was all a whirlwind since then. I grabbed the BOB right before we headed out and sent it with my wife in the ambulance. \n\nWe're all home now. He's fine, has an ear infection and is on a course of antibiotics to fight it off.\n\nMy BOB is pretty standard for a Canuck loadout. You can probably rhyme off what was in there. Additionally, some stuff I have packed for our 3 year old son includes a few toys to play with and, because there was a time we didn't know what was going to happen about our stay in the hospital, I've added a little more cash to the bag. Besides that, the bag served its purpose explicitly and, when needed, we jumped into it to get a replacement set of PJ's for my son after he'd vomitted on the ones he was wearing and put the dirty ones in a garbage bag I'd had in the bag.\n\nOverall, a brutal experience to live through, but a valuable lesson in preparedness and life in general. We're all only one emergency away from crisis.\n\nAs requested:\n\nAll packed into a LAPG 3 day bag, weighs 15 pounds.\n\nThat weight, little as it may seem, was enough to get my mom to complain about it only while she was tasked with keeping the bag in the waiting room - think about that.\n\nMED:\n\nx3 Diapers (He's potty trained, mostly)\n\nX1 Pet Tape\n\nX2 Triangluar Bandage\n\nX3 4\" Pads\n\nX1 3\" Bandage\n\nX1 EMT Shears\n\nX1 10' Length, Paracord\n\nX3 Benzalkonium Chloride swatches\n\nX1 3\" Elastic Bandage\n\nSets of gloves\n\nAssorted Bandaids and small bandages\n\nOUTDOOR:\n\nX1 HIVIZ Vest\n\nX3 Plastic Poncho\n\nX2 Hotties Hand Warmers\n\nX1 Emergency Blanket\n\nX2 Lighters\n\nX1 Box of Matches\n\nX1 Tinder Kit\n\nX1 Flint Steel\n\nX1 P38 Can opener\n\nX1 Cree AA Flashlight\n\nPER:\n\nX1 Full set of clothes for each person\n\nX1 Pack of AA, AAA Batteries\n\nX1 S&W Fixed Blade w/ 20' length of 550\n\nX1 Small can, WD40\n\nX1 Set, utensils\n\nX1 Nalgene\n\nX7 Clif Bars\n\nX7 Instant Oatmeal\n\nToothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, mouthwash, soap, shampoo\n\nZipties\n\nCash\n\nPens, markers, paper\n\nUSB and Hard Copy of all important ID\n",

All the Paramedics that arrived at my place complimented us for calling them and gave the my boy a one over check to make sure he is alright, which is important, the once over check I mean.\n\n**The below information is only what I have collected over the years by talking to doctors. Do talk to your doctor.**\n\nIn his six years he had a lot of these Febrile seizures. I have talked a lot to doctors and paramedics, they all say that there is zero evidence that the Febrile seizures are actually hurting or damaging the body or brain. The way the doctors have described it to me is that the body of a small infant or young person under the age of six (some can be older before they grow out if them) cannot regulate/deal with a sudden spike in temperature and subsequently \"overheat\". The body shuts effecticly down and the \"seizures\" (they aren't actual seiszures) is there to \"shake off\" the temperature (Quote by a nurse). Everytime my boy had a Febrile seizures they never lasted longer then a minute. It **does** happen that he stops breathing during the seizeure (which still makes my heart go a bit faster) and he will go very pale and also sometimes develope blue lips, probably due to lack of oxygen.\n\n**Here is what we have done / do when / if it happens.**\n\n1) **Stay absolutly calm**, I cannot stress this enough, remind yourself that there is NOTHING to worry about. I am not a calm person (I wish I was) and I have over reacted in the past and was absolutly no help at all, in fact I may have made the situation worse. I now force myself to stay as calm as possible, no fast movements, just calm and precise motion. \n\nI make sure he cannot roll of the couche (that is usually the place he is when he sick... watching TV haha) since he moves a log (Febrile seizures) my first priority is to ensure he is absolutly save and cannot hurt himself, although the movements are generally speaking not as \"voilent\" as an actual seizure I make sure that has nothing in his hands he could hurt himself.\n\n2) Immediatly take off all blanket(s) - your first priortiy is to give the body a chance to cool down, we even go as far as to open all windows and cool down the room as much as possible.\n\n3) When all is save, call for your partner to call the paramdedics, if you are alone I suggest to wait until the seizure is finished, I once called them while he had it and it was awkward to talk and watch him at the same time, if your partner is at hand its much better for her/him to go to a quite room and call the paramedics. We have a paper in our hall with all the inforamtion they usually ask, in panic mode you don't remember the most basic shit and I had once a full blown screaming match with a poor guy on the other line who keept asking me if my son was diabetic - I keept responding how the fuck should I know he is only 1 year old, until I understood him, he meant, does he take insuline.\n\n4) Once Paramedics are on their way, send your partner or go yourself outside to direct them to your house. In our house my job is to go outside (because my wife is calmer). Take your mobile phone with you in case you are needed at home or they call you as in the paramdics, we live in a small culdesak and we had them many times getting lost. One of us tend to sit beside him and talk to him, he is not able to respond and it litteraly breaks my heart evertime I see him like that, but stay calm talk to him.\n**Beside the point but the second time it happened I stood on the balcone talking to the first responders and a car exploded in front of me, I am not making this up, somebody put a petrol bomb in a car they stole and parked on the parking lot in front of us, the funny thing was that was the point when I stopped panicing, I got cool as a cucumber and told the first responder if he heard the background sound, told him a car just got up in flames and to also send the firebrigade**.\n\n5) Once Paramdics are in the house let them work, stay out of their way and only answer questions, no paramedics wants to deal with a sick kid **and** hysterical parents, depending on what country you are in (I am living in Ireland) they are fucking amazing and know best.\n\nLets assume you are some place were the paramdics take forever to reach and your kid gets sick, here is what we do. We measure temperature to the point of being annoying to him. If it reaches anything above 38 he is getting a sepository, they are fast acting and push the temperature down in minutes. We also don't allow heavy blankets but light blankets unless he is super cold, but the first priority is to ensure his body can cool down. Calpol and others reduce temperature as well - there are some rules in regards mixing them up - you should ask your doctor.\n\nEdit: Sorry for all the spelling and grammar mistakes, I am posting this from my mobile phone.\nEdit2: One thing I wanted to add and you have to discuss that with your doctor, I am not giving you any medical advice here, just describing what we do. \n\nOne thing we do now is, we don't screw around if he has a bit of temperature, if the temperature gets up to close to 38 he gets a sepository. I am not a friend of medication but in this case its the lesser evil. The impprtant part is to be in line with your partner, we discussed our POA many times and are now a well oiled machine e.g. everybody knows what todo if it happens again, no panic, no running around.\n\nEdit3: Fixing some spelling.",

I am stocking our home pandemic kit and researching the best soap that is effective against avian flu on human skin.\n\nA [2022 article published by the CDC ](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/21-1752_article)says that H5N1 has higher viral stability, so cationic biocides benzalkonium chloride(BAC) or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) are best. But low concentrations of BAC aren't very effective so you have to increase your wash time. Typical grocery store liquid hand soap (like SoftSoap, Dial) are 0.13% BAC and the study recommends 0.2% for best efficacy. I am having a hard time finding BAC soap at 0.2% concentration and basic searches make it appear this concentration is extremely drying and not ideal for extended daily use.\n\nWith two toddlers that won't be washing their hands for multiple minutes (to increase efficacy of 0.13%  BAC), is my most effective option to use foaming Hibiclens (4% CHG)? \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

They prevent one from thoughtlessly rubbing their nose with a germy hand, and they can be peeled off and put in a hamper when entering a house, just like leaving shoes at the door. One can keep a basket of clean gloves in the car and swap them out as needed. \n\nMaybe pretty \"accessory\" gloves will stage a comeback?",

    "body": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking to start a collaborative discussion on **eye drops**, specifically the ones with fancy ingredients like the Japanese kinds, with the goal of **having a reference for eye drop purchasing** in general. I'm creating this post using non-native language Google search results that may be biased by online marketing and AI answers. Therefore, any supplement from the community would be greatly appreciated. **This is not medical advice**, just helpful guidelines that could be considered by some. I welcome any corrections as well.\n\n**CONCERNS**\n\nTop considerations that influence the actual long-term benefits of using these eye drops that I've gathered across the internet seem to be the following:\n\n* **Whitening:** Constricts blood vessels, temporary effects that will wear off in the long term, can cause death of cells\n* **Minimizing redness:** May (?) be the same as above\n* **Asia vs Western Ophthalmology Practices:** US tends to focus on adding lubrication to compensate for tear film, Japan prioritizes adding vitamins and other ingredients to try and treat root causes (even at a superficial level). Due to differences and subsequent lack of understanding in the other's ideology, there could be negative biases against Japanese eye drops as a result\n* **Menthol:** \"Refreshing\" or \"burning\" sensation, mixed reviews on long-term affects. It seems to be temporary physical relief through the secretion of tears and will wear off in the long term, causing damage with too much use. Can also cause irritation. (Ahn, S., Eom, Y., Kang, B., Park, J., Lee, H. K., Kim, H. M., & Song, J. S. (2018). Effects of Menthol-Containing Artificial Tears on Tear Stimulation and Ocular Surface Integrity in Normal and Dry Eye Rat Models. *Current Eye Research*, *43*(5), 580–587. [https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2018.1434895](https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2018.1434895))\n* **Preservatives:** Most Japanese eye drops seem to have preservatives, which could be bad for repeated use\n\n**MARKETING**\n\nDoes products with this emphasis actually do anything special and targeted? Or is it best to ignore and just look for the best product overall.\n\n* Digital eye strain\n* Anti-Aging (taurine for cell turnover)\n* Allergy relief (anti-histamines, ketotifen fumarate)\n* Discomfort for contacts\n* Night recovery (cell turnover as well? panthenol and potassium L-aspartate)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nIn the mass of marketing, it can be hard to find out which ingredients should actually be avoided (and which can be beneficial). The reason for creating this post was because I couldn't find which ingredients did what and what to avoid (ex. does \"minimize redness\" in marketing mean whitening or just lubrication), so hopefully this can be the focus of our discussion and we can build this list. Note this is on the whole, and you should do what's best for you based on your priorities.\n\n* **Ketotifen Fumarate** (OK): Anti-histamine\n* **Chondroitin** (OK): Protective coating\n* **Taurine** (YES): Prevents retinal and optic nerve damage, may prevent cataracts\n* **Panthenol** (YES): Wound healing, percusor of vitamin B,\n* **Potassium L-Aspartate** (YES): Increases tissue respiration, potentially helpful for eye strain and blurry vision\n* **Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK)** (AVOID): Preservative\n* **Naphazoline** (AVOID): Restricts blood vessels for whitening\n* **Tetrahydrozoline** (AVOID): Decongestant, same as above\n* **Menthol** (AVOID?): Temporary, possible damage with long-term use\n\n**PRODUCTS**\n\nI'm pulling out the top recommendations from this page as a baseline and some other reviews I've seen ([https://www.tsunagujapan.com/best-selling-japanese-eye-drops/)](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/best-selling-japanese-eye-drops/](https://www.tsunagujapan.com/best-selling-japanese-eye-drops/)). I'd like to stick to over-the-counter where possible - there's so many options and it's much more readily available especially for foreign tourists, who I assume would be the ones perusing this discussion.\n\n* **V Rohto Premium (Vロートプレミアム)** – All-purpose relief with 12 active ingredients; reduces dryness, redness, and fatigue.\n* **Sante Medical 12 (サンテメディカル12)** – Targets eye strain and dryness with 12 active ingredients for visual focus and comfort.\n* **Rohto Z! (ロートZ!)** – Strong cooling effect; revitalizes tired and red eyes.\n* **Sante FX V Plus (サンテFX Vプラス)** – Refreshes eyes with vitamins; ideal for fatigue from reading or screen use.\n* **Rohto Digi Eye (ロートデジアイ)** – Designed for digital eye strain; combats blue light effects and dryness.\n* **Sante PC (サンテPC)** – Blue light protection; contains Vitamin B6 and chondroitin to support eye tissue recovery.\n* **Zaditen AL (ザジテンAL点眼液)** – Anti-allergy drops with ketotifen fumarate to relieve itching and irritation.\n* **Soft Santear (ソフトサンティア)** – Artificial tears; preservative-free and suitable for contact lens wearers.\n* **Rohto Lycee (ロートリセ)** – Vitamin B12-enriched drops made with women in mind; gentle and brightening.\n* **Sante Beautéye (サンテボーティエ)** – Moisturizing and anti-aging drops for eye brightness and clarity.\n* **Rohto Gold 40 (ロートゴールド40)** – Vitamin-rich formula supporting aging eyes and reducing fatigue.\n* **Sante Medical Guard EX (サンテメディカルガードEX)** – Repairs corneal damage and promotes healing with therapeutic ingredients.\n* **Rohto C Cube Cool (ロートCキューブクール)** – Refreshing daily drops that relieve mild fatigue.\n* **Rohto Youjunsui (ロート養潤水α)** – Night-use recovery drops with taurine to boost moisture and cell turnover.\n* **Sante Beautéye Moon Care (サンテボーティエ ムーンケア)** – Nighttime drops with panthenol and potassium L-aspartate to relax and repair eyes overnight.\n* **Rohto Dry Aid**\n* **ヒアレインS** (Santen Hyalein S?): No menthol, viscous and good for dry eyes, may not have preservatives. Cheaper alternative is Soft Santear\n\nI personally have meibomian gland dysfunction and mild rosacea, both of which lead to dry eyes for me. I'm also facing a screen for many many hours a day, even though I try to minimize with large monitors, which is why drops geared towards \"digital\" is extra appealing but I don't know if they actually work.\n\nHoping to cut through the marketing BS with you guys!

        "body": "Hi there, Thanks for starting this thoughtful discussion — it’s a much-needed topic, especially considering the amount of marketing hype around Japanese eye drops. I’d like to contribute based on research, ingredient studies, and my own experiences. I’m not a doctor, but I’ll keep things as evidence-based and honest as possible.\n\n  \n**Ingredients: What to Look For (and Avoid)**   \n**Worthwhile / Beneficial**  \nTaurine – An amino acid found in many Japanese drops, especially nighttime formulas. It plays a role in cellular repair and may protect the retina and optic nerve. There’s some support for its antioxidant properties.  \nPanthenol (Pro-vitamin B5) – Aids in healing and maintaining moisture. Solid support for its use in wound healing and tissue recovery.   \nPotassium L-Aspartate – Said to enhance cellular respiration. While studies are limited, some users report reduced eye strain.   \nChondroitin sulfate – Often added for lubricating and protecting the ocular surface. Gentle and safe for most.  \n  \n**Best to Avoid (Long-Term)**  \nNaphazoline / Tetrahydrozoline – \"Redness reducers\" that work by constricting blood vessels. They do not treat the cause and can cause rebound redness with prolonged use. Not recommended for regular use.  \nBenzalkonium Chloride (BAK) – A common preservative, toxic to the eye surface with long-term use. Chronic use is linked to dry eye and corneal damage.   \nMenthol – The cooling sensation can be refreshing short-term, but prolonged use may cause irritation and damage the tear film. In rats, it triggered tear production, but this doesn't mean it's good for humans over time. Use with caution. \n\n**Japan vs Western Approach**  \nYou’re spot on — Western eye drops often focus on lubrication (think: artificial tears), while Japanese drops often include vitamins and amino acids, aiming at “eye health” in a broader sense.\n\nThat said, there’s very little peer-reviewed research on whether Japanese-style eye drops actually provide better long-term outcomes. Most benefits are anecdotal or based on marketing. So while the Japanese approach is innovative, Western ophthalmologists often remain skeptical, especially due to preservatives and potential irritation. \n\n**Preservatives: A Big Deal**  \nFrequent use of any drop with preservatives like BAK is generally discouraged.Preservative-free drops (like Soft Santear or Santen Hyalein S) are best for regular use, especially with dry eye conditions like MGD or rosacea-related dryness. \n\n**For Digital Eye Strain**   \nIngredients that may help:   \nPotassium L-Aspartate  \nPanthenol  \nTaurine  \nVitamin B6  \n\n\nProducts like Rohto Digi Eye and Sante PC are tailored for screen users, but again, be mindful of menthol content — not everyone reacts well.   \nAlso, no eye drop is going to “block blue light.” That’s pure marketing. What they may do is alleviate symptoms caused by prolonged screen use. \n\n**For Night Recovery**  \nProducts like:   \nRohto Youjunsui α   \nSante Beautéye Moon Care   \nThese contain healing agents (taurine, panthenol) and are best used at night to help the eyes recover. Less or no menthol, which is better for sensitive or dry eyes. \n\n**For Allergy Relief**  \nZaditen AL with ketotifen fumarate is a legitimate antihistamine. This one is actually evidence-based and effective — it’s used worldwide. \n\n**Final Thoughts** \n\nMany Japanese eye drops are effective if used correctly and sparingly. But the market is crowded with over-the-top packaging and vague claims. Here's how I approach it:  \nDaily use? Go for preservative-free artificial tears (Soft Santear, Hyalein S)   \nOccasional screen fatigue? Try a drop with taurine and panthenol, but avoid menthol if you're sensitive   \nNeed cooling? Rohto Z! is famous, but not for everyone (especially MGD/rosacea users) Allergies? Zaditen AL is solid and safe   \nNight repair? Look into Youjunsui or Moon Care types",

    "body": "I’m honestly at my breaking point. Two months ago, I had zero eye problems. I was focused on my life, my career, and had no idea what floaters even were. And now, I’m here — 20 years old, with 50+ floaters, eye pain, pressure, sleepless nights, and thousands spent on eye appointments. And it all started with one f**ng $3 eye drop.\n\nhow this nightmare started:\n\nI had mild irritation from dust/contacts, so I visited a local eye doctor, who told me everything was fine and casually prescribed me a lubricating eye drop (Systear) with preservatives, made in Bangladesh. He told me to use it for a month — nobody warns you that preservative-containing drops aren’t safe for long-term use. I trusted him and used it for two weeks, mostly in my right eye.\n\nThat drop wrecked me.\n\nSoon after, my eyes went completely dry. Then came the first floater. Then more. I stopped the drops immediately, but it was too late. Things just kept spiraling. Now I have:\n\n- Severe floaters in the right eye (50+ and getting darker/bigger)\n- Moderate floaters in the left\n- Eye pain that shifts between dull and stabbing\n- Pressure and numbness around the right eye and side of my head and sometimes in the left eye aswell.\n- Discomfort on eye movement, especially to the side\n- Mild visual snow when waking up\n- Mild Blurred vision\n- occasional sharp light flickers (maybe due to tension)\n- Floaters forming into hair-like tangled shapes or small balls\n- Pain worsens at night or when sneezing, bending down, or in wind\n\nI’ve now spent hundreds on exams, including a dilated eye exam yesterday. The retina specialist said:\n\n- No retinal tears or detachment as of now\n- Not sure if it’s PVD or early vitreous change\n- Saw a artificated colored cell in the vitreous area (still monitoring)\n\n- Acknowledged that the prescribed drop might’ve caused ocular trauma or allergic inflammation - but still confused \n\nThen, I was prescribed Nevanac (Nepafenac 0.1%) — an anti-inflammatory drop with *Benzalkonium Chloride preservative* again. I’m scared to even put it in my eye. I already feel like a walking experiment.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is that this started over a cheap, unregulated drop, and now I feel like my life is ruined. I can’t watch a movie all I see is floaters, I can't drive at night the floaters make the lights opaque, can’t sleep properly, no trips or swimming, no roller coaster rides and I live every day anxious about whether my retina is going to tear or whether this is the start of vision issues.\n\nI even wrote a full letter to my current eye doctor (I’ve attached the link), explaining everything. told me to come again in 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ENBR9cc\n\nI asked about eye pressure — it was normal.\nI’m angry. I’m exhausted. And I feel like no one really understands how terrifying and lonely this feels. I feel betrayed by the first doctor who casually told me to use those garbage drops. I’ve read everywhere online: “Never trust eye products from developing countries”, and I wish I listened.\n\nIf you’ve gone through anything similar, please share your story. Help me understand what’s going on, or what I should push for at my next appointment.\n\nI’m just 20. I shouldn’t be this scared of losing my vision.  \nI just want my peace back.\n",

Because you were experiencing irritation, possibly already slight symptom's of dry eye disease. The issue with over the counter eye drops is they don't address the underlying issue which most of the times is inflammation. The second thing he prescribed is a anti inflammatory drops the 'should' help bring down the inflammation, therefore provide some relief. Unfortunately the steroidal anti inflammatory eye drops tend to be used only short term due to them causing ocular eye pressure to increase. The next step after that is to start trying out cyclosporine eye drops to see if that helps you out or other eye drops such as xiidra, cequa, restasis, meibo etc",

It exactly started with eye irritation from wind and dust and I used a cheap eye droplet every two hours and it gave me a huge floater when ever I look outside, I dialated my pupil and the Dr said there is nothing. They also gave me anti inflammatory droplets which I won’t use. I went to my GP he gave me steroid pills instead. I advise you you, not to put anything more in your eyes. Just do like me. Take steroid pills into your stomach for 1 month. And I believe you will get better. Many times normal eye examinations don’t show inflammation in the back of the eye. Just remember while taking the steriods, if you feel an upset stomach just buy Nexium to protect your stomach.",

It's a slow metabolic process that doesn't happen overnight. Or even throughout a week. It needs months, sometimes years for floaters to become visible enough. \n\nVisual snow is an indication your nervous system is in overdrive, it's not eye related. Usually brain filters this snow but when your brain is stuck in alert state - it stops filtering it.\n\nYour headaches also can be related to nervous system overdrive and extreme stress you're experiencing.\nDry eyes also can be caused by a simple reason - stress.\n\nI suggest you to switch your attention from your eyes to psychotherapy because there is nothing wrong with them. Your brain notices more floaters because it is in alert state, not because you somehow magically got all these floaters on the course of 2 months (which is impossible, metabolically and physiologically impossible).\nUsually a healthy non stressed brain always filters floaters out, same with your nose, you always see it, but your brain filters it out. \nManage your stress.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@!

    "body": "Edit: Correct inaccuracies and provide a more informed post\n\nSome of the comments urged me go educate myself a little more about benzalkonium-based sanitizers, and I have to say I am a little embarrassed with myself for making such a presumptive and somewhat accusatory post. As such, I offer my correction in that I no longer think that Handvana Foam Sanitizer is an outright scam to get your money, per se.  I do, however, still think they are shady for their use of the real Healthvana’s trademarked name and other questionable acts and omissions likely to mislead or confuse customers (perceived endorsement by a doctor, timing of product, etc.…)\n\nBefore writing this post, I was aware that in April 2019 the FDA deferred final rulemaking on three active ingredients for use in consumer hand sanitizers–ethanol (ethyl alcohol), isopropyl alcohol, and benzalkonium chloride–to allow more time for ongoing studies related to safety and effectiveness.  A deferral extension was granted for final submissions until July 2020. \n\nAlcohol-based vs. Alcohol-free hand sanitizers? Which is better? Do they both kill Coronavirus? Second to hand washing, alcohol-based products have long been the recommended tactic by health organizations such as the CDC and the FDA.  It is the most common and widely used sanitizer, with long history of safe and efficacious use.  And it doesn’t hurt that continued favoritism makes them seem more credible. Notable concerns: the ability to kill bacteria ends once the product has dried on the skin; skin irritation; potential toxicity when ingested; highly-flammable. \n\nIn comparison, benzalkonium-based products often contain less than 0.1% of active ingredient but has been shown to offer the same protection as alcohol-based solutions.  Furthermore, it continues to provide protection well after the product has dried on skin. It is also easier on the hands, non-flammable, and relatively non-toxic if accidentally ingested. \n\nWhat about Coronavirus?  Alcohol-based sanitizers kills many types of viruses.  It also kills bacteria, and since it usually contains hydrogen peroxide, it kills bacterial spore as well.  While alcohol-free products containing benzalkonium chloride do kill bacteria, it is still unknown how effective it is at killing certain types of viruses, thus, it is deemed less reliable for fighting COVID-19.  \n\n\nORIGINAL POST:\nWednesday morning, I saw a commercial for HydroClean from a company claiming to be \"Healthvana\" (whom I later found out was using the real Healthvana's trademarked name), now known as Handvana (company changed their name 19+ hours ago), promoting their \"new hand sanitizer that kills germs and hydrates skin.\" I immediately thought to myself, \"Something seems fishy,\" and made a mental note to do some research on this later. I guess the entity behind HydroClean Sanitizer thought it would be a great time to take advantage of the vulnerable public and rake in a bunch of dough. How nice of them. Now I'm returning the favor by calling them out.\n\nAs if the infringement of a reputable company's name wasn't enough of a red flag, I found that the social media links on HydroClean's webpage, https://healthvanafoam.com, leads to pages used by the company BulbHead. Hmmm...that's suspicious. Oh yeah, Hempvana, LLC is the parent company of n.k.a. Handvana. Interestingly, I just found that HydroClean has a brand Facebook page started on March 18, 2020 and they updated their webpage on March 30, 2020 at 1:30 to https://myhydrocleangel.com, but unless you click this link through their Facebook post, you will get a 404 Error. It's also worth noting that the very last sentence of their new website still shows the company name as Healthvana and fraudulently shows the trademark symbol beside it, and their old website uses the name Healthvana in the address but the very last sentence on this page shows the company as Handvana. \n\nThe commercial and information found on HydroClean's website makes some dangerous and irresponsible statements that are designed to mislead and confuse consumers by suggesting it is a high quality product and, based on the opportune timing of its March 2020 marketing, that it is safe and effective in the fight against COVID-19. Is it? Let's see.\n\nThe commercial states that HydroClean is made with \"an ingredient from an FDA Registered Facility that kills 99.9% of germs so trusted that it is used for surgical prep in hospitals.\" A few seconds later we see a man presented as a doctor stating that HydroClean \"uses the same ingredient that is used in hospital pre-op care\" but he recommends the product \"because of the added moisturizers.\" So, while HydroClean claims to be a powerful product that seems to be approved by the FDA and so trusted it's used in hospitals, the fake doctor only recommends it because of its moisturizers. Really? \n\nSo, is HydroClean powerful enough to kill the germs we're presently concerned with? Let's look at the product ingredients, which include a combination of - benzalkonium chloride, Aloe Vera, coconut oil, and hyaluronic acid. The problem here is the use of benzalkonium chloride, making HydroClean a non alcohol-based sanitizer. The CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to reduce the number of germs on hands when washing them with soap and water is not readily available. \n\nHydroClean's website further misleads customers by suggesting this specific product has over 100 million satisfied customers and has been a trusted brand since 2015. If 100 million satisfied customers used this product then how come I cannot find any reviews? And I'm not sure which brand they speak of because I am so confused now that I'm done looking into this shady ass product.\n\nSources: \n\n[https://healthvanafoam.com/](https://healthvanafoam.com/) \n\n[https://myhydrocleangel.com/](https://myhydrocleangel.com/) \n\nScam Finder’s video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6UWl2maBNY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6UWl2maBNY) and several Twitter posts contain comments by the real Healthvana™ regarding HydroClean’s use of their name and that they are in no way affiliated with this product nor its maker.    \n\n[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-guidance-production-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizer-help-boost](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-guidance-production-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizer-help-boost)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)",

I have not affiliation with this company or it's competitors.  I am simply using my PhD to impart some analysis.\n\nFDA in April of 2019, limited the hand sanitizer active ingredients to 3 (banned 28).  Those 3 are benzalkonium chloride, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol.  The first is the active ingredient in HandVana. (ref:  [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-final-rule-safety-and-effectiveness-consumer-hand-sanitizers](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-final-rule-safety-and-effectiveness-consumer-hand-sanitizers))\n\nI read through the full Federal Register notification and the previous notifications about this topic (2016, and earlier).  Essentially, the FDA has eliminated 28 ingredients from the hand sanitizer market.  The remaining 3 have some efficacy, but need more studies to show that they are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/GRAE).  Manufacturers have been providing data and FDA is satisfied thus far to allow all 3 to stay on the market. \n\nThe article that the CDC references says that benzalkonium chloride is less effective than alcohol based.  I found an article about this chemical from the Chinese Journal of Medicine that mentions this can be used for cleaning ([https://journals.lww.com/jcma/FullText/2020/03000/The\\_outbreak\\_of\\_COVID\\_19\\_\\_An\\_overview.3.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/jcma/FullText/2020/03000/The_outbreak_of_COVID_19__An_overview.3.aspx) ).  \n\nCanada has a list of hard-surface disinfectants and hand sanitizers (COVID-19) ( [https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/disinfectants/covid-19/hand-sanitizer.html)).  There are 52 hand sanitizers that are approved in Canada for COVID-19. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this being said, it does look like alcohol sanitizer is better than the active ingredient in this product for COVID-19.  Hand washing is still best.  This is no need to report them for fraud unless the company claims that it works better than alcohol based hand sanitizers.",

They imply that ordinary gel sanitizers are applied to the palms, but with Handvana being a gel, it gets the whole hand and even between fingers.

I have absolutely no problem spreading it to ALL surfaces of both hands, including between fingers, under my fingernails and the front, back and side surfaces, even my wrists. \nThe fact that there are extra ingredients to keep your skin from drying out is a definite plus. The fact that it's a gel would be appealing to some. But in order to make this into a gel, the pump has an aerator, which means the gel in the bottle is mixed with air, thus less of the actual gel is used with each pump. Anybody can purchase an aerating bottle pump for hand sanitizer or soap.\nHandvana, stop treating us like we're too stupid to see your insulting advertisement tactics.

By way of example, the title of the post claims that our  client “uses False Advertising to Scam you out of your money!”, which is  clearly inaccurate given that you admit later in the post that you “no  longer think that Handvana Foam Sanitizer is an outright scam to get  your money.” Many consumers who come across this reddit post will be  dissuaded from purchasing our client’s product based on the title, and  may not read your later, less prominent, retraction. In particular, a  Google search for “handvana” shows only the false and misleading title,  not your clarifying comments.\n\nMoreover, there appear to be other errors in the post. By way of  providing one additional example, your post claims the last sentence at [www.myhydrocleangel.com](http://www.myhydrocleangel.com/)  shows a Healthvana name and fraudulently makes use of a trademark  symbol besides such a name.

However, while the device they use to pierce isn't spring loaded, it uses a similar piercing procedure to Claire's or other piercing locations that use guns of forcing blunt jewelry through the ear, and with that comes many of the same risks associated with using a piercing gun. I had not one, but two less-than-ideal piercings from them, so I wanted to address some of the claims they make, and to share my experience so others who might be considering getting pierced there will be able to make a more informed choice.** \n\n**Background:** Rowan is an online jewelry retailer that's known for hiring nurses (RNs, LPNs, and LVNs)  to perform piercings in client's homes and inside select Target locations. According to their website, \"\\[they\\] put safety first, with ear piercings performed exclusively by a licensed nurse and hypoallergenic earrings made from premium, nickel-free materials.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"We never use piercing guns, which are spring loaded and can damage the ear tissue... Rowan nurses use a hand-pressurized instrument. This uses the pressure (and complete control) of a Rowan nurse's hand to safely guide, place, and pierce! This instrument holds a sterilized single-use cartridge containing the sterile starter stud earrings that pierce the ear. Unlike piercing guns, which use spring-loaded mechanisms to forcefully pierce, a hand-pressurized instrument allows for a gentle and direct control with each and every piercing.\"\n\n**\"We do not use a piercing gun!\"**\n\nA contraption which forcefully pierces jewelry through the ear tissue, is, for all intents and purposes, a piercing gun. While they may frame their \"hand-pressurized instrument\" as a safe alternative to those of places like Claire's or Piercing Pagoda, piercing the ear with a blunt earring is equally as traumatic, spring-loaded or not. \n\n**\"Piercing earrings are pre-sterilized...\"**\n\nDespite their claims, this is also inherently not sterile. Because their single-use disposable cartridges arrive pre-sterilized as opposed to being done on site, there is no way to confirm that they were adequately sterilized, or that sterility was not compromised at any point during the delivery process. The instrument itself, because it is reused between clients, also is not (and cannot be) sterilized, so any microscopic tissue or bodily fluids could be passed between clients, presenting an increased risk for spread of blood borne pathogens. \n\n**\"Rowan nurses have extensive experience in creating a stress-free environment, are experts in the use of PPE and maintaining sterility, and always put their clients first.\"**\n\nNurses play a vital role in our healthcare system and are highly educated to be great at what they do. However, they are not trained body piercers. Piercings are puncture wounds that require specific and deliberate care in order to heal appropriately, and while nurses are excellent at caring for a variety of injuries and ailments, they aren't necessarily equipped to pierce or troubleshoot an existing piercing.  \n\n**In general, much of the information presented by Rowan does not meet or exceed APP standards.** \n\nThe APP recommends to avoid solutions containing benzalkonium chloride (BZK), which is the only active ingredient in the Rowan Ear Cleansing Solution that they suggest to use for aftercare. \n\n* They also sell an Advanced Ear Cleansing Solution spray, which claims to shorten aftercare to only 3 weeks for lobes and 8 weeks for cartilage (!!!) which contains water, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), and phosphoric acid.\n\nWhen I first found Rowan through an Instagram ad, however, their lofty claims were extremely enticing. \n\n# I fell for it. Twice.\n\nI knew that getting pierced by a needle would be safer than any variation of being pierced by jewelry, but I was really intimidated by the idea of going to a studio. I was (and still am) a bit afraid of needles and I was really worried that if I went to a studio, I would be judged for it. I assumed that because nurses can do all kinds of intricate piercing-like things such as starting an IV or placing a catheter, surely they could do the second lobe piercing I was looking for. It was also pretty affordable. I'd also had my first lobes done at a Claire's close to ten years ago, and they turned out fine. Being a broke college student, the promise of two 14k gold earrings for $100 with the piercing fee included seemed hard to beat, and because I could get it done at my local Target on the weekend, it was super convenient. Considering all this, I decided to (against my better judgment) schedule the appointment. \n\nBeing in Target right near the checkout aisle was a bit awkward, but the whole process took maybe ten minutes, from picking the jewelry to leaving with my aftercare card (the nurse was very curt and wasn't much of a conversationalist, anyway). Unfortunately, the finished product *looked* like it took ten minutes: the sides were completely asymmetrical. I could see the Sharpie ink poking out from beneath the earring, where she'd missed the spot we'd agreed on. Two months go by and my ears were still regularly swelling, secreting discharge, getting sore, the asymmetry only getting worse as time went on. I finally muster the strength to pull out the jewelry and let them close. \n\nI decided to have a conversation with their customer service team. They have a \"happiness guarantee\", after all. They refused to give me my money back, but instead offered I reschedule an appointment for a \"complimentary repierce.\" By this point, I have no excuses for myself other than that I really, *really* wanted to get my 100 bucks worth. \n\nThe second nurse was very kind, and took a great deal of time making sure I was satisfied with the placement of the earrings, and that they were completely symmetrical. However, this only lasted about another month, before both earrings began migrating downwards and outwards from their original location as they healed, eventually becoming so out of alignment with my other earrings that I had no choice but to take them out again. I'm pretty deliberate about caring for them properly, and I'm convinced it was the trauma from the blunt force that caused them to migrate. Not to mention, the butterfly backs of the piercing earrings trapped discharge and god knows what else that wasn't visible until I took them out. \n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nAt this point it's not worth reaching out to their support team again; I'm *not* going back to get re-pierced, and it doesn't seem like they'll be too willing to give me a refund. I've since developed relationships with a few reputable piercers and had other piercings done, with nothing but great experiences from all of them: the body piercing community, I've come to realize, is one of the most supportive and accepting communities, and these great piercers are really helping me overcome my fear of needles. Moral of the story: all piercing guns *are* created equal (equally traumatic, at least), and it's worth it to go to a professional. \n\nThis isn't meant to be Rowan slander. They have some beautiful jewelry at great price points, their nurses are wonderful people who I'm sure are amazing healthcare providers, I do think they are marginally better than Claire's, Icing, Piercing Pagoda, and the like, and their reviews are generally positive. They also offer a cool earring subscription service. From my personal experience and research, though, they would be better off focusing their efforts on the jewelry side of their business, rather than the piercing. \n\n\\*disclaimer: I'm not a piercer, and if there are any pro piercers on here who would like to see anything corrected, please don't hesitate to let me know :) I would like to give the best information possible! This is all just based off of my own *opinions*, experience, and research and I'd be more than willing to consider any additional facts.",

It’s a shame that you’ve had to experience it firsthand.\n\nI wanted to add that it appears that Rowan uses butterfly backs for their earrings, and their gold earrings are gold vermeil over sterling silver. Both of those are not quite the best for your body. Butterfly back earrings aren’t able to be fitted properly to your ear (and usually this results in them being squished on your ear too tight), and the butterfly backing itself can trap bacteria and dirt, making it a choice that pales in comparison to flatback style jewelry. Also, all body safe jewelry used in a piercing studio is solid, never plated (with the exception of rhodium plating, which would be for the ends (not the posts) of healed piercings, anyway). You have solid titanium, pure niobium, or solid 14k or 18k gold, to name a few options!",

    "body": "I had TransPRK in 2018, and like many people developed consistent dryness after the procedure. Initially I used the preservative-free, individual use vials, but after a couple months switched to a cheaper eye drop (Equate brand \"Dry Eye Relief\" which can be found at Walmart). Thought little of it at the time and used them as needed. I used these for a period of \\~2 years pretty consistently. \n\nEventually the dryness reached a level where I didn't need to use them all the time and switched to Theratears which I only need occasionally. That was about 7 months ago. \n\nI discovered later the Equate drops contain Benzalkonium Chloride (BAK) as a preservative, which is used in many drops and has been shown to have toxic and damaging effects to \"ocular structures\" and can even INDUCE dryness ( [A mouse dry eye model induced by topical administration of benzalkonium chloride - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21283525/) ) \n\nHere are some additional links supporting the damaging effects of BAK: \n\n[Cosmetic Preservatives Toxic to the Eye (reviewofoptometry.com)](https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/news/article/cosmetic-preservatives-toxic-to-the-eye) \n\n[Effects of Preservative on the Meibomian Gland in Glaucoma Patients Treated with Prostaglandin Analogues (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769241/) \n\n*\"The most frequently used preservative, BAK, has been demonstrated to have toxic effects on many ocular structures in laboratory, experimental, and clinical studies. It has been shown to cause tear film instability, loss of goblet cells, conjunctival squamous metaplasia and apoptosis, disruption of the corneal epithelium barrier, and damage to deeper ocular tissues. Regarding the impact of preservatives on MGs (Meibomian Glands), in vitro studies have shown that cytotoxic effects of BAK on the human MG epithelial cells are apparent at very low concentrations.\"*\n\nThese studies/articles are only a sample and you can find much more regarding BAK's effect on the eye with additional searching. Other preservatives can be damaging as well and BAK is not unique in this regard. \n\nI bring this up because I had a Dry Eye Evaluation yesterday, during which they do Meibography (imaging of the Meibomian Glands--an extremely simple test that should probably be done during a routine eye exam), and the results showed a serious number of my glands have \"dropped out\" (i.e., no longer functioning/dead/atrophied). Apparently 86% of dry eye sufferers have some degree of MGD (Meibomian Gland Dysfunction). For those who are unaware--the Meibomian Glands produce the oil or lipid layer of your tear film. Without this layer the tears evaporate quickly off the eye and you are left with the awful/potentially debilitating condition of evaporative and chronic dry eye.  \n\nThey only got images of the bottom eyelids however, and I'm not sure if that implies the glands in the upper lids would be just as bad. The Doctor even commented that he's surprised I'm \"feeling as good as I am\", given the amount of dropped glands. \n\nI can't imagine though this would be a unique scenario--pretty much all refractive surgery patients will experience some form of post-operative dry eye, and many of them as a consequence would be buying OTC eye drops that in many cases contain BAK or other preservatives. I should say that this is the first time I've had imaging like this done of the Meibomian Glands, so it's impossible to pinpoint when they began to drop out. I wore contacts for 6-7 years which can also apparently be a factor. However, I never experienced any sort of dryness before the TransPRK, and reading the numerous studies, like this one-- [In vitro effects of benzalkonium chloride and prostaglandins on human meibomian gland epithelial cells - PubMed (nih.gov)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30580056/)  seem to show pretty definitively there is a link between the health of your MGs and use of BAK. At this point it seems crazy anyone would use a BAK containing drop long-term if they had a serious interest in protecting the health of their Meibomian Glands. Mine were being soaked in this toxic substance daily for 2 years. \n\n\"*The most common preservative used in eye drops is* ***Benzalkonium chloride (BAK)****. The effects of BAK have been well studied and it is known to cause inflammation and cell damage.\"*\n\nSo for those of you who have had surgery, check the ingredients in the eye drops you're using--Even more important if you are using them constantly. The toxicity could even be enhanced since your eyes aren't producing as many tears as normal--to \"flush out\" the harmful preservatives and instead they remain in the eye. And #2, get your Meibomian glands checked. It's incredibly easy, inexpensive and you want to know if there's an issue there before all of them disappear (they never regenerate, and you are in serious trouble if you get to that point). \n\nFor those considering surgery, I'd recommend getting them checked as well. If you already have loss or dysfunction in the glands, I wouldn't think this patient would be an ideal candidate.",

Water needs to circulate from the resovoir into the rest of the system.\n\n#**Clearing Clogs**\n\n- Your device is probably not cooling as well due to biological build up inside the hub. Biofilm, bacteria, algae, etc. Something is in there and has been multiplying.\n\nThe first thing you want to do, is disconnect your cover from your hub, and drain the cover. See any yellow, or milky chunks coming out? That is what you need to get rid of.\n\nPurging hub: \n\n## Clearing Clogs / Biofilm Buildup\n\nIf your Pod isn't cooling well, biological buildup (biofilm, bacteria, algae) in the hub or cover is a likely cause. This guide helps you purge it.\n\n**⚠️ Important Safety & Prep Notes:**\n*   The drain tool **does not click** into place on the hub; you must **hold it firmly** during draining.\n*   Priming without the drain tool properly attached *could* build up damaging pressure. If you briefly remove it to use pressure bursts for purging, do so for only 1-2 seconds at a time. Do at your own risk. I'm not sure if the device has enough power to break itself.\n*   **Always unplug the hub to stop the priming process** after a few cycles or when changing connections.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Initial Cover Drain & Inspection\n1.  Set the Pod temperature to 110°F (43°C) via the app and let it run for a bit (e.g., 45-60 mins) to help loosen internal buildup.\n2.  Disconnect the cover from the hub.\n3.  Drain the cover into a bucket. Observe the water: are there yellow, white, or milky chunks/flakes? This is the gunk you're trying to remove.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Purging the Hub\n1.  Place the hub on a counter next to a sink.\n2.  Tip the hub so its drain ports point into the sink.\n3.  **Firmly hold** the drain tool against the hub's drain port.\n4.  Fill the hub's reservoir with **tap water**.\n5.  Using the Eight Sleep app, initiate \"Prime\" or \"Start Priming.\"\n6.  Let water purge through.\n7.  **Unplug the hub** to stop priming.\n8.  Repeat steps 4-7 several times to flush the hub thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Purging the Cover\n\n**A. First Pass (On the Mattress):**\n1.  Reconnect the cover to the hub (if you disconnected it completely after Step 1).\n2.  Ensure the hub is filled with tap water.\n3.  Set the Pod temperature to 110°F (43°C) via the app and let it run for a bit (e.g., 45-60 mins) to help loosen internal buildup.\n4.  Disconnect the cover's hoses from the hub. Attach the drain tool to the cover's hose.\n5.  Direct the hose (with drain tool attached) into a bucket. You might need someone to help hold the drain tool / hose end.\n6.  Roll around on the mattress or apply pressure to push water out of the cover.\n\n**B. Thorough Purge (Off the Mattress - Recommended for stubborn clogs):**\n1.  Remove the cover from the mattress and place it on a hard, flat surface (e.g., clean floor).\n2.  Use a clean, dry paint roller, or yoga roller, etc (or similar smooth, broad object) to gently press down and roll across the cover, squeezing out more water and dislodged gunk into a bucket or drain.\n\n**C. Flushing the Cover (Repeat if Necessary):**\n1.  Reconnect the cover to the hub.\n2.  Fill the hub's reservoir with fresh **tap water**.\n3.  Run a priming cycle and set a high temperature again to circulate water through the cover. Let this get to ~110F. \n4.  Disconnect the cover and drain it again (repeat steps 3.A.4-6 or 3.B.1-2). Repeat this flush-and-drain cycle 1-2 more times if significant gunk was seen.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Hub Purge & System Refill\n1.  After cleaning the cover, some dislodged gunk might have entered the hub. Perform a quick purge of the hub again (repeat Step 2) using tap water.\n2.  Reconnect the cover to the hub securely.\n3.  Add your chosen maintenance solution (e.g., the recommended ~5 fl oz of Benzalkonium Chloride solution, or your previous hydrogen peroxide dosage).\n4.  Fill the rest of the tank with **distilled water**. Keep filling and priming the device until it stops taking more water. \n\n5.  Run a priming cycle through the app to distribute the solution throughout the system.\n\n---\n\n**Reminder:** Ensure daily maintenance/priming is enabled in the app. This circulates water (and your cleaning solution) from the reservoir through the system, which is crucial for preventing future buildup.",

    "body": "From the outset, Eight Sleep recommended using hydrogen peroxide mixed with distilled water. However, about a year and a half ago, they revised this guidance (source: [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EightSleep/comments/1agmm1w/tap_water_nothing_about_distilled_water_andor/)) and stated that tap water alone is now acceptable. Around the same time, they introduced a daily maintenance feature in the app.\n\nTap water can contain bacteria, which can proliferate when water stagnates over a period of time. Among these bacteria is Legionella, which can be harmful if it becomes airborne and is inhaled via water droplets. These bacteria can also cause the water to become cloudy, form biofilms, and lead to blockages. Water flow helps mitigate the growth of Legionella, creating a less hospitable environment for it.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is an effective antimicrobial agent that can help reduce bacterial growth, thus offering some protection for the pod. However, hydrogen peroxide can also react with rubber materials, causing them to swell, harden, or crack. The compatibility of rubber with hydrogen peroxide is commonly assessed by its swelling ratio. Materials that swell by less than 10% are considered excellent, while those that swell by 20% or more are deemed poor ([source](https://www.marcorubber.com/chemical-compatibility/HYDROGEN%20PEROXIDE,%2090%25)).\n\nRecently, I noticed that my pod cylinder was leaking water. Upon investigation, I found that the rubber ring around the valve had swollen significantly, causing it to be too large to keep the valve in place. After replacing the ring, I also discovered that the pod was unable to draw water from the cylinder into the system. I believe this issue existed long before I noticed the leak—possibly even while it was still under warranty—but since the pod and cover contained enough water, the system didn't require additional water from the cylinder. However, prior to replacing the rubber valve ring, I also drained the water from the cover, but now that the rubber ring has been fixed but without enough water in the system, a new issue to surfaced: a stuck solenoid.\n\nFixing the solenoid is more complicated than repairing the cylinder valve. Eight Sleep doesn't even try to repair it; instead, they provide a replacement pod. If the warranty has expired, you either get a discount or have to handle the repair yourself. If your warranty is still valid, I strongly advise against attempting to fix the solenoid yourself.\n\nI decided to attempt the repair myself, as some other users had done. With the help of videos from other users, I was able to open the solenoid. While some users removed the plunger and reinserted the solenoid without plunger inside, I chose to only remove the transparent white rubber end of the plunger and then put the plunger back into place. I did this because I suspected that the rubber end could also be affected by the swelling caused by hydrogen peroxide. And to my surprise, the solenoid and pod started working again.\n\nThis supports my believe that hydrogen peroxide may be causing critical rubber components in the pod to swell, which in turn affects the pod’s functionality.\n\nUsers often report problems with their pods around two years after the warranty expires, which may correlate with the use of hydrogen peroxide. The exact recommended concentration was unclear from the beginning, as the instructions provided by Eight Sleep were very ambiguous ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/EightSleep/comments/103dy0m/how_much_hydrogen_peroxide_2_tablespoons_vs_16oz/)).\n\nThis raises the question: did Eight Sleep discontinue the recommendation of hydrogen peroxide to avoid the potential damage it could cause to the pod, while simultaneously introducing daily maintenance to control bacterial growth? The newer Pod 4 and Pod 5 models also feature a maintenance insert containing benzalkonium chloride, which has antibacterial properties. However, benzalkonium chloride can also be incompatible with rubber materials, though its effects may be less severe than those of hydrogen peroxide, because of the lower amount.\n\nSo I would opt for following the advice from Eightsleep:\n\n* No hydrogen peroxide anymore. Pod 4 and 5 users have benzalkonium chloride maintenance insert anyway.\n* Use the daily maintenance feature.\n\nPerhaps Eight Sleep is simply aiming for a more convenient solution for its users. However, I’m not looking for convenience—I want to do what's best for my Eight Sleep pod and cover.\n\nMaybe, for Pod 3 users, the optimal solution might be to perform an antibacterial prime using hydrogen peroxide mixed with water, followed by a rinsing prime with water only to remove hydrogen peroxide to prevent damage to the rubber components.",

I struggle to walk more than 20 steps, even with a cane. As a result, I sit a lot. Worried about pressure ulcers, I got a padded seat cushion. This was mistake #1.\n\nAs with advanced HS, I have a LOT of drainage that wraps from my belly, straight back to my tailbone. I also can’t shower, because our tub has a high wall that I can’t step over. I bulk bought antibacterial bath wipes so that I can clean up throughout the day. This was mistake #2.\n\nOver the past month, my wounds have gotten SO much worse. My labia are so swollen that I can’t help but scream and cry when urinating and wiping afterwards. My butt and butt cheeks are so painful that I have to sit and sleep on one side. I can’t sit upright at all without sobbing, and I need help putting clothes and shoes on. As of two days ago, one of my labia split open.\n\nIf you’re still reading, friend, let me tell you HOW I did this to myself. That seat cushion? As it turns out, it was too firm for every day use. The constant pressure on my HS wounds was only making them worse. In an attempt to avoid wounds, I was making new ones. The attempt to keep clean and cut down on bacteria? The bath wipes contain Benzalkonium Chloride, which are safe for dermatological use in SMALL amounts. These wipes have quite a bit of this substance. Also, it’s a rather harsh substance and allergies and irritation aren’t uncommon. AND... it’s not to be used on broken or irritated skin.\n\nI came to the conclusion late last night that the cushion could be the issue when my husband was helping me out and made a comment about how hard it felt. We made the decision to sit down without the cushion, and I immediately noticed how much easier it was to sit and how much less painful it was. I am sitting here now, STILL in less pain than before. The wipes? I noticed with the first use that there was a lot of burning. I’ve stupidly continued using them until just a bit ago, when I decided to do a Google search on Benzalkonium Chloride and while it’s generally safe, in my situation, it is not.\n\nSo this, dear reader, is how I totally screwed up and made a totally horrible condition even worse and how I’ve been unnecessarily torturing myself.

I have had many down times, but since learning about this disease  I would still say that the best friend you can have in fighting it is water!",

    "body": "**Skin type:** combination (oily nose and chin, dry everything), sensitive, acne and eczema prone.\n\n# Backstory: \n\nThis summer has been hell for my skin. Never had an eczema flare up on my face before, but yup it happened now. My eczema wasn't as severe as some of the other cases I'd read about, but it got pretty bad. My face itched constantly, I couldn't sleep at night, I felt like my face was cracking open. Went to the dermatologist and he prescribed some topical steroids, but I could only use them for upto 10 days, and the patches would just return when I stopped.\n\nI tried applying about 3 layers of the cetaphil moisturizer my dermat recommended, but that just made me itch more. My skin wouldn't allow more than 1 layer of that.\n\nAnyway, I decided to try out Aveeno dermexa because everyone said it would be good. And yup it was, not my HG product or anything, and I'm definitely on the lookout for better alternatives, but I'm super thankful because my face is in control now.\n\nJust to clarify- I wasn't looking for something to make my eczema vanish, I just wanted some relief until I could get an allergy test done and find out the cause. This did the job pretty well.\n\n# General details about the product:\n\n* Has colloidal oatmeal, ceramides and avenanthramides. \n* Clinically proven to provide relief from 5 signs of dry skin : redness, itching, scaling, tightness and roughness. (Lives upto claims)\n* Formulated to minimize risk of allergies.\n* Fragrance and essential oil free.\n\n# Full ingredient list: \n\nAqua, Glycerin, Panthenol, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Petrolatum, Isopropyl Palmitate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Avena Sativa Kernel Flour, Avena Sativa Kernel Extract, Avena Sativa Kernel Oil, Ceramide 3, Isopropyl Alcohol, Steareth-20, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate, Benzalkonium Chloride.\n\n**Price :** Rs.990 for 200ml.\n\n# Texture and smell: \n\nIt doesn't feel heavy on the skin and absorbs pretty quickly. Still, I would not recommend for oiler skin types for obvious reasons. It has a very rice-y smell? It's pretty nice, whatever it is.\n\n# My face skin routine:\n\nWash face with Cetaphil cleanser, then apply Cetaphil moisturizing cream (not DAM) on damp skin. Apply a layer of Aveeno dermexa. Wait for 15 minutes, then use Rx required nadifloxacin 1% cream on acne.\n\n# Good results:\n\n* My itching calmed down significantly. It isn't completely gone, but I've only used it for about 5 days, and it says on the back that results in 4 weeks, so I'll have to wait more I guess. Promising results till now though.\n* My redness went down too. It's still there, but reduced a lot. \n* Skin feels more plump and moisturized, scaling decreased a lot too. \n* Skin feels more healthy, isn't as dull as it was before. \n\n# Bad results:\n\n* I got a few pimples on my forehead and nose. These are my regular spots though, and I just got my period (was irregular this time) - so the breakout might not be due to the product. Irregular cycles always aggravate my acne. I'll have to see after my period gets over. **I don't think its due to the product, because my acne doesn't feel itchy or any different than usual.**\nEDIT : aveeno dermexa was not the cause for the pimples, I can confidently say that now.\n\n* It isn't heavy on the skin, and no visible cast either - but it feels a little uncomfortable if I'm under the sun. \n\n# Would I repurchase? Yes. Until I find something better, this is my best bet.\n\n**I definitely would recommend this to people with dry, irritated and/or sensitive skin.**",

The issue is that there are thousands of these compounds with different names - no ingredient list will have \"quaternary ammonia\" listed. It will be \"behentrimonium chloride\" (looking at you CeraVe) or \"benzalkonium chloride\" (busted, WaterWipes). They won't always have chloride in the name, but -ium is a tip. \n\nI wanted to share with all you awesome moms out there that you can use chatgpt (or whatever multimodal ai you prefer) to snap a picture of ingredients and ask \"are there quats in this?\" In nerd circles, \"quats\" is a common term for quaternary compounds. \n\nThe paper wasn't a smoking gun to health impacts, but scary enough for me (a molecular biologist) to think of these compounds as guilty until proven innocent.

    "body": "Home treatments or first-stage interventions for dry eye disease focus on lifestyle adjustments and over-the-counter solutions to alleviate symptoms. Here are the commonly recommended steps to take for Dry Eye Disease that eye doctors recommend. That said, not all doctors would agree on all of them.\n\n**1. Artificial Tears**: Over-the-counter artificial tear drops are a primary form of symptom relief for dry eye symptoms. They help to lubricate the eyes and provide temporary relief. It's important to choose a preservative-free formula if you're using them more than four times a day to avoid irritation. Particularly Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) which is effective as a preservative but its potential for ocular surface damage, especially with prolonged use, has led to the recommendation to use BAK-free or preservative-free formulations for patients with chronic eye conditions or those requiring frequent administration of eye drops.\n\nThis article is the most comprehensive one on artificial tears I have ever seen titled: **A Comparative List of Artificial Tears—with Download**  that can be found here:\n\n[https://eyesoneyecare.com/resources/a-comparative-list-of-all-artificial-tears-with-download/](https://eyesoneyecare.com/resources/a-comparative-list-of-all-artificial-tears-with-download/)\n\n**2. Warm Compresses:** Warm compresses are generally a safe and effective way to alleviate symptoms of dry eye disease for many people. That said for some people it makes things worse (increases the inflammation for example) thus you need to stop them.\n\nThat said Rolando Toyos, MD, a prominent DED/MGD specialist writes the following:\n\n\"Warm compresses have been a mainstay of DED treatment that has never been questioned. Better data shows that cold compresses are better for inflammation and pain.\"\n\nSee further below on how to do a “cold compress” approach.\n\n*Here is how to do it if you want to use the warm compress approach:*\n\n**Materials Needed**\n\n* A clean, soft washcloth, or a commercially available[ warm compress eye mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv9V7Sv9xWs) (or any other brand you might prefer) or even [an electric heated eye mask](https://www.amazon.com/Aroma-Season-Flaxseed-Syndrome-Blepharitis/dp/B07LBL172C) or (any brand you might prefer).\n* Warm water (not hot) or a microwave (if using a microwavable eye mask).\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Prepare the Warm Compress:\n\n* If using a washcloth, soak it in warm water. The water should be warm enough to feel comfortable on the delicate skin of your eyelids but not so hot as to cause burns or discomfort.\n* If using a microwavable eye mask, follow the manufacturer's instructions for heating. Typically, this involves microwaving the mask for a specified amount of time.\n\n1. Test the Temperature:\n\n* Before applying the compress to your eyes, test the temperature on the inside of your wrist to ensure it is comfortably warm and not hot enough to cause injury.\n\n1. Apply the Compress:\n\n* Lie down or recline in a comfortable position.\n* Close your eyes and place the warm compress over your eyelids.\n* Relax and keep the compress in place for about 10-15 minutes. The warmth helps to soften and release oils from the Meibomian glands, improving tear quality.\n\n1. Gently Massage: (note: not all doctors recommend this part due to the possibility of damaging the cornea)\n\n* After using the warm compress, some people gently massage their eyelids to help express the oils from the glands. Using clean hands, lightly massage the eyelids in a circular motion or gently press downward on the upper eyelids and upward on the lower eyelids. [Here is an example of how to do eyelid massage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGJqucoHmjs&t=308s)\n\n1. Repeat Regularly:\n\n* For best results, use warm compresses once or twice a day, especially in the morning and/or evening. Consistency is key to managing symptoms effectively.\n\n1. Follow Up:\n\n* After removing the compress, you might use artificial tears if recommended by your eye care provider to help lubricate the eyes further.\n\n1. Cleanliness:\n\n* Ensure the washcloth or eye mask is clean before each use to avoid introducing bacteria to the eye area.\n\n**Tips for Success**\n\n* Consistency: Regular use of warm compresses is crucial for managing dry eye symptoms effectively.\n* Hygiene: Always use a clean compress to prevent eye infections.\n\n*Here is how to do it if you want to use the cold compress approach:*\n\nClean Cloth or Compress: Use a clean, soft cloth or a specialized cold compress. You can buy gel-filled compresses that can be chilled in the refrigerator.\n\nChill the Compress: If using a cloth, soak it in cold water, wring it out slightly, and then place it in a clean plastic bag. Refrigerate the bag for 15 to 30 minutes. If using a gel-filled compress, follow the manufacturer's instructions for cooling.\n\nTest the Temperature: Before applying the compress to your eyes, test the temperature on the back of your hand to ensure it's not too cold.\n\nApply the Compress: Lie down in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and place the chilled compress over your eyelids. If using a cloth, you may need to re-chill it once it warms up to body temperature. A gel-filled compress usually retains its cold temperature longer.\n\nDuration: Leave the compress on your eyes for about 10 to 15 minutes. You can use this time to relax and unwind.\n\nFrequency: You can apply a cold compress 2 to 4 times a day, depending on the severity of your symptoms and as recommended by your healthcare provider.\n\nHygiene: Always use a clean cloth or compress to avoid the risk of infection. If using a cloth, wash it after each use.\n\nMoisturize: After using the cold compress, you may want to use artificial tears or prescribed eye drops to help lubricate your eyes, especially if they feel dry after the compress.\n\n**3. Eyelid Cleaning Upon Arising and Bedtime:** One would first wash their face and eyes with a mild soap like [Dove for sensitive skin](https://www.dove.com/us/en/p/sensitive-skin-beauty-bar.html/00011111613782). Next most people use what are commonly called “eyelid wipes”. This video will give you a good start on options to consider: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb8pFX1jDIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb8pFX1jDIQ)\n\nNow just to be sure you have all the info to decide some of the wipes have Tea Tree Oil (TTO) in them. Doctor’s disagree if that is a problem given the small amount. [Here is the case against using TTO in anything](https://toyosclinic.com/blog-feed/stop-using-tea-tree-oil). [Here is the case for using TTO is some situations. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC0kxJtgy3Y&t=317s) You will have to decide I figure.\n\nAfter the eyelid wipe some will use a hypochlorous acid spray that has antiseptic and cleansing properties that can help with dry eyes. It can also help with blepharitis especially if it's caused by bacteria. Hypochlorous acid has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that can help reduce inflammation and inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms on the ocular surface. Some people will do just this step and not use lid wipes. You can find different brands by Googling “hypochlorous acid spray for dry eyes”.\n\nFinally, you need to know many doctors say do not use Baby Shampoo in any amount in cleaning your eyes. Here are some examples on why not to use baby shampoo:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5OvPhiqRlA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5OvPhiqRlA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrLHAP96WU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdrLHAP96WU)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dheRpZUC6QQ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dheRpZUC6QQ)\n\n**4. Demodex Issues**: Demodex mites are parasites that live on our skin. Some types of them specialize if you will in face and eyes. Virtually everyone has them. Over 40? You have a lot. Over 60, even more. Over 70…everyone has them. If you are reading this article I figure the chances of you not having a demodex issue are very low. If you want a deeper dive into Demodex here is [a great article research review.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10351901/) There are over the counter solutions that can do the trick and/or knock them back so they don’t take over and cause damage. If those fail there are prescription drug solutions in ointment and eye drops forms. So what are the over the counter options? The eyelid cleansing in the previous section is helpful. If you use a lid wipe that is targeting Demodex like Cliradex or OustDemodex those are probably the most targeted to Demodex although[ there are a lot of brands](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cliradex+eyelid+wipes&crid=PO7E2N1X0N4A&sprefix=Cliradex+wipes%3A%2Caps%2C213&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_15) with tea tree oil in them that don’t tout their product loudly Demodex killers.\n\nNow just to tell all the story some doctors do not recommend using Tea Tree Oil (TTO) see here:\n\n[https://teamtoyos.com/stop-using-tea-tree-oil/](https://teamtoyos.com/stop-using-tea-tree-oil/)\n\nCliradex has some elements that are extracted from Tea Tree Oil (TTO) but not TTO itself. TTO can be hard to tolerate for some. Also TTO itself has limited scientific evidence that it would work well on Demodex and evidence that in too large an amount TTO could be damaging to the Meibomian glands. Thus using TTO itself is likely a risk if the TTO is too concentrated. Here is an Optometrist explaining the reasons why TTO in lower concentrations are not a problem:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC0kxJtgy3Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC0kxJtgy3Y)\n\nHere are a couple more of them on TTO:\n\nHow to Get Rid Of Eyelid Mites That Cause Demodex Blepharitis!\n\nNeal Guyman, DO\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0U8ZccbBT8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0U8ZccbBT8) \n\nHow to Apply Oust Demodex with Albert O. Edwards, MD, Ph.D.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3mVMT4Qqps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3mVMT4Qqps) \n\nSo you will need to decide for yourself which way to go.\n\nAnother OTC approach is Hypochlorous Acid. There is some evidence to suggest that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) solutions may be effective in managing dry eye disease associated with Demodex mite infestation. These solutions can be used as eyelid cleansers to remove debris, excrement, and Demodex mites from the eyelash follicles and eyelid margins.\n\n**5. Blinking Exercises:** Regular blinking exercises, especially for those who spend a lot of time in front of screens, can help maintain moisture on the eye's surface. The most common advice is follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds) can reduce eye strain and encourage blinking.\n\nFor desktops, laptops and tablets this is a great app to help you blink more: [https://www.blinkingmatters.com/](https://www.blinkingmatters.com/) For your cell phone go to your app store and put in “eye blink” and you will have options.\n\nHere are more robust common recommendations for eye blinking exercises:\n\n1. Complete Blinking\n\n* Purpose: To ensure that the eyelid completely touches the eye, spreading the tear film evenly across the surface.\n* How to Do It:\n* Sit comfortably and relax your eye muscles.\n* Slowly close your eyes as if you are falling asleep, ensuring that your upper and lower eyelids make full contact.\n* Keep your eyes closed for 2 seconds.\n* Open your eyes slowly.\n* Frequency: Repeat this exercise for about 5 minutes, several times a day.\n\n1. Forced Blinking\n\n* Purpose: To refresh the tear film and ensure regular blinking, especially important for people who use computers or screens extensively.\n* How to Do It:\n* Blink your eyes forcefully, making sure the eyelids completely close.\n* Hold the eyelids closed for half a second before opening.\n* Frequency: Perform this exercise every 20 minutes while using screens or whenever your eyes feel fatigued.\n\n1. Blinking Breaks\n\n* Purpose: To counteract the reduced blink rate associated with screen use, which can exacerbate dry eye symptoms.\n* How to Do It:\n* Every 20 minutes, take a break to blink slowly 10 times.\n* Focus on fully closing your eyelids with each blink.\n* Frequency: Incorporate this into the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds), adding blinking exercises during the break.\n\n1. Soft Blinking\n\n* Purpose: To practice gentle, effortless blinking that ensures complete eyelid closure without force.\n* How to Do It:\n* Relax your facial muscles and gaze softly ahead.\n* Let your upper eyelid drop naturally without forcing it to close.\n* Ensure your eyelids make gentle, full contact, then open.\n* Frequency: Practice this technique frequently throughout the day to promote healthy blinking habits.\n\n1. Palming\n\nWhile not a blinking exercise, palming can help relax the eyes, which in turn can facilitate healthier blinking habits.\n\n* How to Do It:\n* Rub your hands together until they feel warm.\n* Close your eyes and gently place your palms over them without pressing on your eyelids.\n* Relax in this position for a few minutes, breathing deeply.\n* Frequency: Use this technique during breaks or when your eyes feel particularly strained.\n\nIntegrating these blinking exercises into your daily routine can significantly alleviate dry eye symptoms, especially for those who spend long hours in front of digital screens. That said there are some apps that can be used as well.\n\nHere are a couple of app options for reminding you to blink etc. while you are on your computer:\n\n[https://eyecare.apps4u.net/](https://eyecare.apps4u.net/)\n\n[https://www.blinkingmatters.com/](https://www.blinkingmatters.com/)\n\nWhile the direct evidence supporting the use of blue light filters for protecting eye health is mixed, it is at least arguable that they may help reduce eye strain and improve sleep quality by minimizing blue light exposure in the evening. For those concerned about long-term eye health, using blue light filters could be considered a preventative measure, though it's also important to adopt other healthy screen-time habits.\n\nHere are some options for you to review that could be very helpful in reducing eye issues with blue light apps:\n\n[https://alternativeto.net/software/eye-saver/?p=3](https://alternativeto.net/software/eye-saver/?p=3)\n\n[https://care-eyes.com/](https://care-eyes.com/)\n\n[https://www.eye-saver.net/](https://www.eye-saver.net/)\n\n**Link to Part 2:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/1b4500x/14\\_home\\_otc\\_treatments\\_for\\_mild\\_moderate\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/1b4500x/14_home_otc_treatments_for_mild_moderate_and/)",

    "body": "I am a physician (Pediatrics) and C. diff survivor.\n\nToday, I was in the supermarket looking for bleach wipes when I discovered that they had none.\n\nMost disinfectant wipes (“LYSOL”, “CLOROX,” etc.) contain a benzalkonium chloride or alkyl methyl ammonium chloride.  This chemical disrupts bonds between many different biological molecules and damages many virii and bacteria.  But not C. diff spores.\n\nC. diff exists in two states.  One is the rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium that divides, metabolizes, and produces toxins.  This is called the “vegetative” state.\n\nThe other is a tough, encapsulated spore that contains the bacterial DNA, a few ribosomes, and some proteins required to leave the suspended animation spore state and return to the active vegetative state.\n\nBenzalkonium chloride and related compounds can’t sufficiently penetrate the spore’s tough outer layers to disrupt the molecular machinery hidden inside.\n\nBut household bleach is a compound called sodium hypochlorite.  This is a highly unstable, reactive compound consisting of one chlorine atom, an oxygen atom, and a sodium ion.  The hypochlorite ion is small enough to penetrate the outer layers of the spore and get inside where it reacts with proteins, sugars, fats, and most importantly, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).  With the DNA badly damaged, spores cannot bloom back into the vegetative state and they are neutralized.\n\nThis is one of only three ways to adequately kill C. diff spores.  The other two are boiling and incineration.\n\nSo if your sanitizing wipes say “benzalkonium” or “alkyl C-n methyl ammonium chloride,” they will not kill C. diff (or norovirus, another tough bug).  They need to contain sodium hypochlorite.\n\nAn example of such a product is “CLOROX HEALTHCARE” sanitizing wipes.  (I have no preference for or affiliation with any of these brands.)\n\nNow, *THIS IS BLEACH*.  It’s dangerous.  It can burn you and damage your eyes and lungs.  Please use it in a well-ventilated area, wear gloves, and keep your face away from it.  \n\nBut make sure you are reading labels.",

    "body": "I have been traveling/moving and stressed a whole bunch in the last few months, especially in the last 3 weeks. My epiduo is empty, I found out Ponds has a really high pH so I've stopped using that for the time being, my trusted stridex is at home, I think cerave hydrating cleanser might be breaking me out, or the cerave in the tub is breaking me out. I kind of stopped using all skincare products (I'll use sebamed in the shower even though I don't *love it* and remove my make-up at night, but with all the traveling, hotels, airplanes and stress I'm sometimes not even showering everyday). My mother gave me some cheap dollar store antibacterial wet wipes for my purse, and when I ran out of make-up wipes/baby wipes and I was too broke to buy more I reached for them. They were labeled \"alcohol free\" and I didn't see any jump-out-at-you ingredients on the label. I started using those to remove my make-up or even just sweat, dirt and oil before I went to bed. \n\n*Dood*, I saw a difference in days. They aren't super drying - I have no rebound oil, smiling issues or tightness - and they don't sting my skin. My active acne died down and I haven't had any new comedones pop up since, which is kind of shocking considering my last few months. My tone and texture is so much better (I actually am having trouble stopping myself from rubbing my face)\n\nTo be totally honest, I have done this before. Christmas of 2013 I was in the middle of moving apartments and used antibacterial hand wipes for a week (there were only 10 in the package) and I was dubious about the results. I saw a difference in my acne, thought it must be the wipes, said \"nah...\" and continued with my normal products and routine. Now that my skin has been torture for months I thought it wouldn't hurt to try those wet wipes again to see if it was all in my head. Nope. My acne is improving again. I actually kind of wish this weren't true - and I have been debating whether or not I should share my experience here because it sounds like such blasphemy! \n\nI put the ingredients into CosDNA for the 2 exact kinds I was using. The [alcohol-free](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2b4a189259.html) one literally came up all 0's on the scale (the antiseptic/[active ingredient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzalkonium_chloride) is a little bit more controversial and worrisome, I'm looking into that) and the [one with alcohol](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2562189260.html) had more irritating ingredients.\n\nI used some of my universal pH strips to test the wipes and they tested at a 5 on the scale.\n\nI don't want to be like \"EVERYONE GO USE HAND WIPES ON YOUR FACE RIGHT NAO\" because these particular ones I felt ok using because they are alcohol free and have few ingredients. But I can't help but wonder why this lazy mishap has done the most for my acne than anything else I have tried in the last 2 years. Even my insane religious hand cleansing, pillow swapping, pump buying, microfiber washing, pH testing, wait time wasting, product testing habits hasn't made me stop and look at the results as much as this has. \n\nI DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE.\n\nedit: oh, just want to add this. I've been on 4 rounds of oral antibiotics before with no difference to acne on my face. I have used gentamicin ointment on my face at night (like vaseline) and usually see some quick relief with that as well. So obviously killing the bacteria is what's helping, but oral antibiotics never helped, and topical seems to work the best for me. My skin reacts very negatively to benzoyl peroxide, once causing a rash/burn for 7 hours and spot treatments with BP aren't as effective. So....head scratch.\n\nedit: I keep trying to find info on Benzalkonium Chloride. I'm gonna post links here just because. \nhttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/publications/search_result_record.cfm?id=50120",

    "body": "Hello fellow kiwis. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been on this subreddit for a while, exasperated and disheartened at the lack of products we have access to. I'm going to share a bit of information about the products I have found available in supermarkets and nationwide stores, due to my obsession with poring through skincare aisles.\n\n**BHAs:**\n\n[Clean & Clear Advantage Fast Clearing Spot Gel 10g](http://www.thewarehouse.co.nz/red/catalog/product/Clean-%26-Clear-Advantage-Fast-Clearing-Spot-Gel-10g?SKU=1336248): Available at the Warehouse for $10.99. Countdown doesn't carry this on its own, it sells the combined pack of 4 kit with a cleanser + whatever else. 10g seems small but it has lasted me ages! I used it as a nightly or twice daily spot treatment, and I put it on my T zone where my SFs are. It doesn't burn or anything.\n\nIngredients\n\nActive ingredient: **salicylic acid** 2%-acne medication. Inactive ingredients: alcohol, ammonium hydroxide, benzalkonium chloride, butylene glycol, c12-15 alkyl lactate, c13-14 isoparaffin, capryloyl glycine, cedrus atlantica bark extract, cetyl lactate, cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract, cocamidopropyl pg-dimonium chloride phosphate, cyclopentasiloxane, dehydroxanthan gum, denatonium benzoate, fragrance, glycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)\n\nClearasil Ultra - Rapid Action Pads. 65 Pads.\nThese are available at countdown. I can't remember the exact price but they're around $12-15. A few downsides - there is a lot of liquid in this pot and it leaked when I was travelling, so I had to keep it in a plastic bag. It does mean though that you could probably use half a pad, and use any excess liquid in the bottom with cotton pads. This kind of stings when it goes on, and the pads are textured for some reason so it's best to pat your face with them. \n\nIngredients\n\nActive Ingredients: **Salicylic Acid** (2%) (Purpose: Acne medication) Inactive Ingredients: Water, Alcohol Denatured, Isoceteth 20, Hydrogen Peroxide, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylparaben, EDTA (Ethylenediamine-Tetra-Acetic Acid), Potassium Sorbate, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben\n\nThese both have denatured alcohol in them, so might not be ideal for those are sensitive to that.\n\n**AHA**\n\nThis is the reason I made this post! This is the first thing I have found with an AHA in it. I really want to try the St Ives pads but ordering them online is a mission. The only AHA I can get my hands on is lactic acid in the form of milk and yoghurt, but I'm not keen on putting those on my face every night. I found these today:\n\n[Skinfood Facial Cleansing Wipes](http://www.skinfood.co.nz/skin-care/all-products/facial-cleansing-wipes.html) - $10.19 online, or I found them in countdown for approximately the same, or $8.90 on special with onecard today anyway. Bloody good ingredient list if I don't say so myself. I tried one tonight and they are very soft, and big. 25 in a pack. I am not sure whether this contains a good concentration of AHA, but it is an option.\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerine Cocoglucoside, Aloe Vera Extract Chamomile Extract, **Lactic Acid**, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone.\n\n**Clay Mask**\n\n[Freeman Avocado & Oatmeal Facial Clay Mask](http://www.freemanbeauty.com/product/avocado-oatmeal-facial-clay-mask)\n\nDon't get excited about the price on that website - I found this in farmers and if I remember correctly it was about $20 - but definitely worth it. They have different kinds of masks, I think I remember seeing the Pomegranate Facial Revealing Peel-Off Mask and one other one, and they also have them all in sample packets for about $2. This one comes out green, smells lovely, and dries really quickly. \n\n**Things that I use, and other info**\n\nBenzac AC in a white tube is probably the cheapest **benzoyl peroxide** product - the 5% one I've seen in Countdown and Pak'n'Save, but Pharmacies have it in 2.5% and 10% as well. I got the 5% one and I use it very very sparingly as a spot treatment on my hormonal acne when it flares up, and it does a good job of clearing it, although I wish I had found the 2.5% first. It is about $20 in Countdown. Use too much though and you'll risk flakiness and redness like I got. I would recommend not making this a habit, only a spot treatment if necessary. Clearasil also does a benzoyl peroxide cream as well, which I have seen in countdown.\n\nI also use Cetaphil Gentle Skin **Cleanser** which is in countdown and farmers, it doesn't dry my skin out or give it a tight feeling. I got the biggest size bottle and it will last me AGES. Cetaphil moisturiser isn't my favourite though - it leaves quite a waxy feeling on my skin.\n\nI use Aveeno SPF 30 **moisturiser** which is in all supermarkets, which is a chemical sunscreen. This stings my face when I have irritated my skin too much though, and sometimes pills on my sin. I have a tonne of Neutrogena SPF 50/70/80/100 chemical sunscreens that I use on my face as well, which are good, albeit make me very shiny. \n\nI found jojoba **oil** in Farmers - there are two sizes, and both are fairly expensive - I think I bought the 30ml one for around $30? The pumps squirt out the oil really inefficiently. I'm not sure if I'll buy it again. They have some argan oil there as well - only one brand though and it is expensive. If you really want to buy oils, I recommend checking out Iherb, linked to further down in the post.\n\nI bought the Olay Regenerist vibrating brush face cleanser thing from the warehouse for $35.99. I've used it about three times cautiously. I have been told by someone on this sub that it causes microtears in the skin due to the way it vibrates. When using it on my face I do notice that it kind of moves my skin in different directions, so I can see how it might be a bit rough and cause abrasions. I'm not sure I want to risk microtears so I might not use it on my face any more.\n\nI bought [DermaLab Super Hydrating Moisturiser](http://www.dermalab.co.nz/moisturiser/) from farmers and love it.\n\nThe Warehouse has huge bulk packs of cotton pads and balls for like $3. \n\nYou can find CeraVE on Amazon, but I haven't given that a try yet. Some places don't ship to NZ, PM me/leave a comment if you want to order some and I will find my bookmark of the ones that ship to NZ.\n\n\n**Websites that ship to NZ:**\n\n[Paula's Choice no longer has a NZ site, but does ship to NZ for a flat rate of $15US, arriving in about 8 days](http://www.paulaschoice.com). They regularly have specials and discounts. PM me if you are a new purchaser who would like $10 off your first purchase. PC usually has discount codes that give 20% off - PRPAULA20 currently works as of May 2014.\n\n[Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/mandelicacids.html) ships to NZ, as well as [Silk Naturals](http://host.silknaturals.com/creb/toners-c-107_122.html). Iherb has a [LOT](http://www.iherb.com/search?kw=aha&x=0&y=0#p=1), like that [Aztec Clay](http://www.iherb.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay-1-lb-454-g/29363#p=1&oos=1&disc=0&lc=en-US&w=st%20ives&rc=22&sr=null&ic=2) and even raw ACV, but is lacking certain brands like St Ives. Not sure about shipping costs or times for any of these sites. It's not as ideal as buying things instore, but it's there if you want certain things.\n\nI have used [Iherb](http://www.iherb.com/) twice now and it is great. Use the search bar for recommendations as to what to buy from there. Choose the $8 shipping and it will arrive in about a week. This is where you should go if you are looking for **cheap AHAs** - look for the Alpha Hydrox brand. It also has a tonne of cheap ELF products, as well as Raw Apple Cider Vinegar, Aquaphor, Aztec Clay Mask, Mint Julep Mask, Coconut oil, etc.\n\nPLEASE add your own products that you use! I want to have a good idea of what works for people and what we have in NZ. \n",

They sell some avene products too, and lots of other fancy looking brands that I don't really know anything about. *ETA: I just did a fake cart to find out shipping rates, and economy shipping to NZ for two bottles of sunscreen was $13 AUD. not at bad all!*\n\nYou might also strike gold looking in local health food stores. There is one near me that sells raw honey and ACV, as well as some brands I haven't seen in stores anywhere else like alba botanicals (fruit enzyme products) and Dr bronners. They also have a lot of skincare oils, but those are usually cheaper from garden of wisdom. GoW have *heaps* of clays too.",

    "body": "There seems to be a lot of confusion with the recent posts of bleach baths, so here is some research I did and it's summaries.\n\n(I am by no means an expert in dermatology, my only relevant experience is research in Systems Biology)\n\nA study found that colonization of S. aureus, a bacteria part of the microbiota in the human body, caused higher inflammation in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). This of course doesn't imply a cause and effect, but bleach bathing specifically targets this.\n\nThe most common concentration used in RCTs of Sodium hypochlorite(NaOCl), or, bleach, is from 2\\~6%, while the ratio of bleach to water in a bath is 60ml\\~120ml to 15L (4\\~8% concentration), applied at most 10 minutes. (Frequency varies but usually 1\\~3 times per week)\n\nIt seems that more recent papers suggest that many of the older papers that suggest a positive feedback are flawed with biases and a small number of participants and studies. However, there are a few that do still suggest it as beneficial. Side effects may include itchiness, decrease in sleep quality, increased severity in AD, lowering of quality of life, but are either with inclusion of bias and/or of very low certainty.\n\nHowever, some interesting observations:\n\n1. The use of bleach ( not just bleach baths) are associated positively for AD for those whose allergens are outdoors or cats.\n2. It seems that bleach bath show a stronger sign of improvement for AD for those who have more severe symptoms, while it is likely trivial for those who have milder symptoms.\n3. **Current literature does suggest that bathing improves** **AD**, however, there was no significant difference in bathing compared to bleach bathing, as well as risks. (Bleach bathing is as dangerous as normal bathing as long as you abide to common sense)\n4. Alternatives that do not include bathtubs are more expensive, and include topical antiseptics/antibiotics, Benzalkonium chloride, Triclosan, Chlorhexidine.\n\nA [novel treatment for AD](https://www.drugs.com/nda/nemolizumab_240214.html) is soon coming, called Nemolizumab, a anti-IL-31 receptor antibody, which basically limits priuritis (itching). (It's in phase III but who knows when it's coming out. Still, exciting.)\n\n\n\nIf you want to try bleach bathing, here is an excerpt from a paper that is a protocol to make a bleach bath from trials:\n\n1. Explain to the patients that their skin may benefit from \"swimming in pool water\". Then give them these instructions for making a pool right in their very own bathroom.\n2. Add lukewarm water to fill the bathtub completely (about 40 gallons of water \\[15L\\])\n3. Depending on the size of the bathtub/amount of water used, add 0.25-0.5 US Cup (60\\~120ml) of common bleach solution to the bath water. Any sodium hypochlorite 6% will do; the goal is to make a modified Dakin's solution with a final concetration of 0.005%.\n4. Stir the mixture to ensure that the bleach is completely diluted in the bath water.\n5. Have patients soak in the chlorinated water for 5-10 minutes.\n6. Thoroughly rinse skin clear with luekwar, fresh water at the end  of the bleach bath to prevent dryness and irritation.\n7. As soon as the bath is over, pat the skin dry. Do not rub dry, as this is the same as scratching.\n8. Immediately apply any prescribed medications/emollients.\n9. Repeat bleach bath 2\\~3 times a week or as prescribed by the physician.\n10. The following restrictions apply:\n11. Do not use undiluted bleach directly on the skin. Even diluted bleach batchs can potentially cause dryness/irritation.\n12. Do not use bleach baths if there are many breaks or open ares in the skin (May cause intense stringing/burning)\n13. Do not use bleach baths in patients with  a known contact allergy to chlorine.\n\n\n\nRevisit on the Use of Bleach Baths as a Standardized Treatment for Atopic Dermatitis ([2022](https://journals.lww.com/prcm/fulltext/2022/06040/revisit_on_the_use_of_bleach_baths_as_a.4.aspx))\n\nBleach baths for atopic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis including unpublished data, Bayesian interpretation, and GRADE ([2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120622002861))\n\nBleach baths for atopic dermatitis  ([2022](https://depressiongenetics.med.upenn.edu/ifi/assets/user-content/documents/bleach-baths.pdf))\n\nEfficacy of bleach baths in reducing severity of atopic dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis ([2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120617309584))\n\nPrevalence and odds of Staphylococcus aureus carriage in atopic dermatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis ([2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26994362/))\n\nUse of bleach baths for the treatment of infected atopic eczema ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/ajd.12015))\n\nDomestic use of hypochlorite bleach, atopic sensitization, and respiratory symptoms in adults ([2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091674909008744))\n\nManagement of atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population ([2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18829806/))\n\ntldr; Bleach bathing is safe if you don't stick it in any orifices of the body, and it's cheap so you might as well try.\n\n",

Just my anecdotal experience.\n\nTurns out I am allergic to the preservatives in the nose sprays the doctors have been giving me for years. BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE to be specific.   \n\n\nThis is the preservative in Nasonex, Flomist, Iliadin, most generic mometasone sprays and even in some basic saline sprays. \n\nHow I found out was, I had an allergic reaction to taking 3 500mg panados. \n\nPanado is 500mg Paracetamol and 0.12% m/m potassium sorbate as preservative. \n\nI thought for a while that I was allergic to paracetamol but I did blood tests which came out negative. And in my last surgery the doc's were giving me IV paracetamol with no issue. \n\nAdditionally, after my last sinus surgery, I stopped taking nose spray's for a month and my nose was perfect.\n\nThen I began the nose sprays again and all the symptoms came back. No taste, no smell, blocked nose lots of yellow/golden mucus. Absolute hell again.\n\nSo this led me to believe that the sprays were an issue and I connected it with the preservative sensitivity.\n\nThis led me down the path of allergies to preservatives and I came across a few interesting medical papers: \n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1987.tb00386.x#:\\~:text=Asthma%20and%20rhinitis%20are%20the,the%20most%20common%20causative%20agents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1987.tb00386.x#:~:text=Asthma%20and%20rhinitis%20are%20the,the%20most%20common%20causative%20agents)\n\nAsthma and rhinitis are the main hypersensitivity symptoms in the respiratory tract, and azo dyes, benzoic acid, and sulfitic food additives are the most common causative agents.\n\n——\n\n[https://karger.com/orl/article-pdf/47/5/278/3375821/000275784.pdf](https://karger.com/orl/article-pdf/47/5/278/3375821/000275784.pdf)\n\nAbstract. A 33-year-old woman with documented hypersensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and preservatives, causing bronchial asthma and rhinitis when ingested, was investigated because of ‘allergy to nose drops’. It was found that she had a serious local reaction caused by the preservative used in the nose drops prescribed. This reaction might occur more commonly than realized, since sensitivity towards ASA is fairly common in the general population.\n\n——\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10566570/#:\\~:text=Most%20decongestant%20sprays%20contain%20the,the%20symptoms%20of%20allergic%20rhinitis.\n\nMost decongestant sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BKC), which causes toxic reactions in the nose, eyes, ears, and lungs, and may exacerbate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. \n\n——\n\n[https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(01)91127-8/pdf](https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(01)91127-8/pdf)\n\nBenzalkonium chloride as a preservative in nasal solutions: re-examining the data\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI need to find a way to do blood tests to confirm the preservative allergy but from what I can tell, there is no conclusive way to test for preservative allergies:   \n[https://www.allergy-clinic.co.uk/allergies/food-allergy/food-additives/#:\\~:text=General%20rules%20for%20preservatives%20and%20additives%3A&text=The%20reactions%20are%20not%20IgE,results%20with%20false%20negative%20results](https://www.allergy-clinic.co.uk/allergies/food-allergy/food-additives/#:~:text=General%20rules%20for%20preservatives%20and%20additives%3A&text=The%20reactions%20are%20not%20IgE,results%20with%20false%20negative%20results).  \n\n\n\"General rules for preservatives and additives:The reactions are not IgE mediated and can be immediate or delayed for a few hours. **No accurate diagnostic tests are yet available** and even CAST testing (Cellular Allergen Stimulation Testing) produces variable results with false negative results.2 J\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, long story short, I stopped using nose spray's altogether and my nose is 100%-ish again.

    "body": "Hi folks,\n\nMy partner has severe eczema over most of their body and, due to some less than ideal lifestyle changes, they had the worst flare-up in years (the absolute worst I have seen since I have been on the scene, helping out with managing it.)\n\nThe flare-up lead my partner to get more prescription cream, this time they were given one which happened to be an immunosuppressant. My partner had a *massive* reaction with a full-body outbreak of large staph-looking boils in clusters within the first couple of days of applying the new cream.\n\nUp until this point, my partner was very reluctant to try bleach baths or other lifestyle changes to address flare-ups but because of the boils appearing they were much more open to making changes.  \nHere's what we did to manage it:\n\n* Removed all sources of infection \"vectors\" wherever possible\n\n* Used a spray bottle with \"bleach bath water\"\n\n* Switched to full-length cotton thermals as bed clothes\n\n* Rotated towels and thermals, washing each time after each use\n\n* Applied povidone-iodine regularly\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo go into more depth:\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##General showering infection control\n\nDiscard old razors and either discard loofahs, wash cloths, exfoliators etc. or thoroughly wash and disinfect them.\n\nAvoid using anything besides soap (or other cleansing applications) and your hands, wherever possible. \n\nWhere there is need for using shower \"tools\" ensure that you wash and, where possible, disinfect them thoroughly after each use, allowing them to dry between each use.\n\nPlace a fresh razor into a small jar filled with disinfectant located outside of the shower and ensure to rinse the razor well before use and wash after use, placing the razor head back into the disinfectant when finished.\n\n(A double-edge shaver is ideal here because it's affordable to discard the blade after each use and as it is possible to open up the handle it makes thorough cleaning much easier. Cheap, plastic double-edge razor handles are available online for only a couple of dollars.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Bleach bath spray\n\nSince my partner developed classic staph-looking boils as a reaction to immunosuppressant cream it was pretty clear that there was an underlying staph infection to my layman eyes. Bleach baths are recommended to prevent/mitigate the spread of skin infections like this but my partner was really, really resistant to the idea of bathing because they said it would sting their hands.\n\nWe settled on the idea of making a solution of bleach bath water as per Eczema peak body instructions for diluting bleach and salt, then after showering my partner spent 10 mins+ dousing their skin with the spray bottle, ensuring that all parts of their skin were constantly wet with the spray.\n\nWhile this is not ideal and it does not have recommendations in medical studies this is a workaround which may be useful for people who don't have bathtubs or who won't use a bath for any reason.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n\n* Use at least a 500ml (1/2 quart) spray bottle, preferably 1L (1 quart)\n\n* Always pre-diute the bleach to make it easier to manage and to accurately pour (for example, we are using a bleach:water ratio of 10ml:160ml, then using 20ml of this pre-diluted bleach to make the spray in a 1L bottle. You *will* need to check your bleach concentration and figure out your own dilution as per the advice you have received.)\n\n* Store diluted bleach in an opaque bottle, out of sunlight (bleach degrades in sunlight)\n\n* Discard bleach solution after a few days, as diluted bleach degrades rapidly\n\n* Spray body down for 10 mins+, keeping skin wet, and allow to air dry\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Rotating towels & thermal bed clothes\n\nTrack down a disinfectant which has benzalkonium chloride as an active ingredient, if possible.  \n(This is a QAC which is effective over a longer period than povidone-iodine and what it doesn't kill off of staph or other bacteria it's going to prevent the growth of. There are many, many studies showing this to be effective in infection control that you can easily find by searching but I'm not going to bore you with them.)\n\nFill a bucket 3/4 full with disinfectant diluted to a hospital-grade ratio. Dump used towels or bed clothes directly into bucket, ensuring that they are fully submerged, and washing once you have reached a full laundry load or you are out of towels/thermals.\n\nThe reason for the thermals is to reduce skin damage from night time scratching and to reduce the spread of bacterial infection across the skin and in sheets.  \n(We will also be attempting using the thermals as a workaround full-body wet wrap therapy as soon as my partner is feeling brave enough to try it.)\n\nAs for towels, I have transitioned my partner over to \"Turkish towels\" (aka hammam towels) because they are flat and without a pile, just like how sheets are. This means that they trap less gunk, they aren't scratchy, and the most important aspects are that they take up minimal space (in the disinfectant bucket, the washing machine, and in storage) and they dry *extremely* quickly. \n\nYou could repurpose some old cotton bed sheets to get the same sort of thing if you are on a tight budget or if you need something asap.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n* Use Turkish towels\n\n* Use a benzalkonium chloride disinfectant diluted appropriately in a bucket, discard all used towels and bed clothes into bucket after each use\n\n* Discard disinfectant solution each wash cycle\n\n* Buy cheap thermals as the residual bleach on the skin from bleach bathing will attack the fabric and the constant washing will quickly wear them down\n\n* A minimum of 3 pairs of thermals and 3 Turkish towels is recommended\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Povidone-iodine treatment\n\nThis seemed to work exceptionally well for my partner's open sores and boils which had just opened, and it reduced the infection in a dramatic way before we got an antibiotic prescription and before the antibiotics could kick in and do their work. My partner's body was virtually painted from head to toe with iodine at the worst point of their skin infection.\n\nWe followed the treatment protocol of [this study](https://doi.org/10.1159/000246033), applying iodine on all affected areas, leaving it for about 3 mins, then showering to remove the iodine (if your infection or your sores are localized you could simply rinse it off under running water instead of showering.)\n\n⚠️ It's important to rinse off the iodine, except under contradicting medical advice, as there is a risk of causing sensitization by being exposed to povidone-iodine for longer periods ⚠️\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Apply povidone-iodine to any sores or areas of infection\n\n* Leave for 3 mins before rinsing off thoroughly\n\n* Repeat 2-4x a day, where possible (1x a day is better than nothing)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Daily Routine\n\nThis is what our daily routine looked like:\n\n**Morning**\n\n* Place last night's thermals into disinfectant bucket\n\n* Apply povidone-iodine to infected skin and sores\n\n* Wait 3 mins\n\n* Rinse off in shower\n\n* Dry off using Turkish towel\n\n* Place towel into disinfectant bucket\n\n**Evening**\n\n* Apply povidone-iodine and wait, as above\n\n* Shower & wash as per usual\n\n* After shower is finished, spray body down with bleach bath spray for 10 mins+ (this is also the time to gently wipe any weeping or crusty sores with a single-use disposable cloth [or paper towel if you don't have anything else available])\n\n* Apply moisturizer and allow skin to air dry\n\n* Put on fresh, full-length cotton thermals for bed\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**N.B.** I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice. You should *always* follow the medical advice you have been given.\n\nThis is just a protocol for managing a severe eczema outbreak based on the best scientific evidence I could find and it worked for my partner so I'm putting it up here as an option for others to consider if they are struggling. As always, if you want incorporate any of these things into your own eczema management routine then use your common sense and make sure that you have approval to do so from medical professionals.",

    "body": "Where do you draw the line between “supplement” and “drug”? And how much processing of a “natural” substance can occur before it’s no longer “natural”? These seemingly-philosophical questions are very real when it comes to the supplement industry. In many countries, regulators have implemented weaker safety, effectiveness and quality standards for anything branded a supplement or natural health product. The result has been a boon and boom for manufacturers, with thousands of products flooding the market. This same boom has challenged consumers and health professionals who are seeking products that are safe, effective, and manufactured to high quality standards (and in the bottle you are buying). Nowhere is this challenge better illustrated than a supplement that I’ve seen for sale for some time. Grapefruit seed extract (GSE), according to promoters, is a panacea that destroy bacteria, viruses and fungi anywhere in the body, without any risk of harm. But the actual science is quite telling. Grapefruit seed is a supplement that’s of such poor quality that even herbal medicine boosters recommend against its use.\n\n**Grapefruit seed extract is claimed to treat virtually every infection**\n\nGSE is claimed to be produced from the seeds of the grapefruit (Citrus x paradisi). The production method isn’t clearly described but different manufacturers say they grind the seeds and pulp in water, and then process this chemically to yield an extract. The methodology of production doesn’t appear standardized, nor is it disclosed in sufficient details to given consumers any assurance that the product is consistent (in content) or safe to consume.\n\nGSE is primarily promoted to treat or prevent infections. It is believed to be simultaneously antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal. As a liquid, it can be applied topically to surfaces as a disinfectant, or to skin as an antiseptic. It is also consumed orally based on claims that it can treat infections of the gastrointestinal tract (or elsewhere in the body). It is particularly popular for the alternative medicine treatment of what’s called “chronic candida” infection. [Chronic candida is not a real condition, but is a fake disease](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/) created out of thin air as an explanation for often non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. In the “treatment” of chronic candida, it’s claimed that GSE selectively kills fungi but leaves normal gastrointestinal species intact. In addition to being consumed in the belief that it can treat candida infections, it’s also claimed that GSE can treat toenail fungus, restore normal blood lipids, heal wounds, “alkalize” the body, is an effective douche, cures warts, treat “dysbiosis”, and more.\n\n**There’s no evidence grapefruit seed extract has any meaningful effectiveness**\n\nDoes grapefruit seed extract actually work? Before looking at the evidence, it is important to distinguish between in vitro use (i.e. in glass dishes on lab benches) and in vivo use (i.e. in an actual human or animal). What kills bacteria, viruses and fungi in a test tube or on an agar plate isn’t necessarily going to be effective when you swallow the same ingredient. Consider the following scenario: Tequila, based on its alcohol content, is going to be an effective disinfectant on surfaces. You can probably disinfect your hands with it, just like you would with an alcohol gel. But no matter how many margaritas you may drink, tequila will not cure your cold or any other infection in body. To be effective after it’s consumed, an ingredient must be absorbed into the body, distributed via the bloodstream to the appropriate location at a minimum concentration, and be present long enough at that location to have an antiviral, antibacterial, or antifungal effect. At the same time it has to do so without causing you or your body more harm than good. Tequila fails spectacularly on all counts. It’s not effective because it’s not possible to have enough in your body to have an effect without killing you. The bottom line is that the only way GSE can truly be evaluated is through actual clinical trials. Test tube or any other in vitro studies are irrelevant when looking at any internal use. GSE, or any supplement or drug for that matter, isn’t exempted from basic efficacy requirements; the only true measure of efficacy is rigorous testing against a specific infection.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, there is a lack of evidence showing that GSE has any effectiveness for any condition. [A search for clinical trials with grapefruit seed extract reveals no results.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22grapefruit%20seed%20extract%22[All%20Fields]%20AND%20Clinical%20Trial[ptyp]&cmd=DetailsSearch)\n\n**Commercial grapefruit seed extract products may be adulterated with synthetic disinfectants and antibacterials**\n\nThere is a serious problem with commercially available GSE products sold on the market. There’s an over 20-year history of adulteration of GSE products with synthetic antibacterial disinfectants and cleansers. The first report appeared in the 1990s when [testing of a commercially-available GSE product found benzalkonium chloride and triclosan](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9037863), which were not found in an extract of the seeds themselves. A [1999 study tested six products](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10399191). Five were effective inhibitors of bacteria and fungus in test tubes. In all five products, the synthetic preservative benzethonium chloride was detected. Three extracts also contained triclosan and methylparaben. The one GSE product with no additives also had no efficacy. The investigators also tested their own seed extract, as well as pulp. No antibacterial or antifungal properties were noted. In their own words:\n\n>\"Thus, it is concluded that the potent as well as nearly universal antimicrobial activity being attributed to grapefruit seed extract is merely due to the synthetic preservative agents contained within. Natural products with antimicrobial activity do not appear to be present.\"\n\nA [2001 paper](http://www.naturalingredient.org/Articles/takeokagrapefruitseed.pdf) drew similar conclusions:\n\n>\"This work has conclusively demonstrated that benzethonium chloride is present in commercial GSE samples. Higher amounts of benzethonium chloride were present in powder GSE samples than in liquid GSE samples, although though we did not determine the exact concentration. This research confirms an earlier study that found benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE samples. It seems unlikely that benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp.\"\n\nThere have been several other studies conducted. All point to the same conclusion. GSE products that are commercially available are regularly adulterated with synthetic antibacterial and antifungal disinfectants. GSE products that are not adulterated have no efficacy, because GSE has no intrinsic efficacy at all.\n\nThe American Botanical council summed this up nicely in a 2012 paper:\n\n>\"A significant amount, and possibly a majority, of ingredients, dietary supplements and/or cosmetics labeled as or containing grapefruit seed extract (GFSE) is adulterated, and any observed antimicrobial activity is due to synthetic additives, not the grapefruit seed extract itself. Tests conducted in multiple laboratories over almost 20 years indicated that all commercial GFSE preparations that exhibited antimicrobial activity contained one or more synthetic microbicides/disinfectants, while freshly-prepared extracts of grapefruit seeds made with a variety of extraction solvents neither exhibited antimicrobial activity nor contained the antimicrobial synthetic compounds found in the commercial ingredient materials. Furthermore, over the course of the 18 years covered by the various analyses, the actual antimicrobial compounds found in the putative grapefruit seed extracts changed from triclosan and methyl p-hydroxybenzoate in early samples to benzethonium chloride in the middle years to mixtures of benzalkonium and/or alkonium chlorides in more recent years. The suggestion on a commercial website that these antimicrobial compounds are formed from the phenolic compounds naturally occurring in grapefruit seed and pulp by heating them with water, ammonium chloride, and hydrochloric acid is not supported by chemical evidence, or any known organic chemistry pathway. None of these compounds could be formed from flavonoids like naringenin, the most abundant flavonoid in grapefruit seeds, pulp, and peel, or other grapefruit seed constituents (e.g., limonoids) and ammonium chloride; the alkyl chains and substituent arrays found in the antimicrobial adulterants are not naturally present in grapefruit seed and cannot be prepared from those materials. The fact that the antimicrobial components found in GFSE changed from 1991 to 2008 not only argues against such in situ synthesis (i.e., occurring naturally or synthesized in the processing of grapefruit seed material itself), but is suggestive of efforts by manufacturers of these commercial materials to stay one step ahead of analytical methods to detect adulteration.\"\n\n**Grapefruit seed extract products may cause unpredictable effects with prescription drugs**\n\nGSE products have the potential to cause significant drug interactions. One case report notes that a GSE product significantly increased the levels of warfarin (Coumadin), which means a significantly increased risk of bleeding for patients taking the drug. Upon further examination of the product it was determined that [the active ingredient was actually benzethonium chloride.](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00228-007-0289-1) Benzethonium is an antiseptic that is for surface disinfection and is also in consumer products like mouthwash.\n\nThe Natural Medicines Database says that GSE is possibly safe based on [this paper](http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1990/pdf/1990-v05n03-p155.pdf). The paper describes the open-label use of an extract and provides no data or statistical analysis, yet concludes the product is effective and safe. I am not convinced that these conclusions are appropriate given the methodological quality of this paper and the widespread adulteration issues documented above. Given the risk of potentially harmful drug interactions, and the unknown ingredients that may be used to adulterate commercially available supplies, GSE products have the potential to cause significant harm when combined with medications like anticoagulants.\n\n**What’s the bottom line with GSE?**\n\nThere is no evidence suggesting that actual grapefruit seed extract has any meaningful antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral effects. Repeated testing over the past 20 years has demonstrated that any GSE efficacy is due to product adulteration with one or more synthetic chemical disinfectants. Adulterated or not, there is no reason to take GSE at all. The fact that it continues to be widely sold is testament to the ineffectiveness of regulations that should put consumer safety ahead of a manufacturer’s right to sell a dodgy product.\n\n**SOURCE: [Science-Based Medicine](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/not-natural-not-safe-grapefruit-seed-extract/)**",

My mum was confused as she hadn’t changed any products she was using and was no obvious cause. \nShe does however use a hygiene product so she can wash my dads soiled clothing at lower temperatures. \nI remembered seeing a post on BORU about woman with a mystery rash that turned out to be caused by the active ingredient in laundry sanitiser ‘benzalkonium chloride’. Apparently people can develop a reaction to this stuff after a period of time.\n\nChecked the one mum was using and whilst wasn’t the exact same chemical it was one very similar.\nSo she stopped using it to see if made a difference and within a week dad has stopped scratching and his rash is starting to disappear. \nThought I’d share just incase anyone else is experiencing anything similar for someone they care for",

I thought I could beat the elements in my outside job - but alas, I fought a hail storm and lost the other day. The dirt in the wind exfoliates my skin a little too well.\n\nExistence is pain - my skin burns just sitting on the couch, no products on.\n\nEnter skincare. I'm overwhelmed. I would like to be whelmed.\n\nI managed to start an extremely simple routine and now I'm ready to add in more products but want to heal my skin barrier before breaking out the Vit C and exfoliants.\n\n**Skin background:** dry + dehydrated in a hot + humid environment (southern USA).\n\n**lots of allergies:** almost all nuts, shea, pineapple, yogurt, avobenzene, snail mucin, benzalkonium chloride.\n\n**My routine:**\n\n**AM:** water wash, Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule, alternate between Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics & Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50. i guess my sunscreen is my moisturizer.\n\n**PM:** Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser, Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule, Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Pack - I really like ths, but definitely need a moisturizer under as this.\n\n**Tried:**\n\n* Cerave moisturizing cream - caused my eyes to swell.\n* TirTir Milk Skin Toner - made my skin feel very dry. smelled like rubbing alcohol.\n\nSo far the products in the list below look super promising for hydration and skin barrier repair.\n\nBut, do you think any of them are redundant? Minus hyaluronic acid, that’s in everything.\n\nFor instance, do I really need that Tiam B5 Toner if I have the Purito B5 Re-barrier Cream? Or a dedicated beta glucan serum if two products already contain beta glucan (Skinfood Propolis Serum, RNW Ceramide Plus Serum)? Is a daytime and a nighttime moisturizer overkill? Should I just get Stratia Lipid Gold?\n\nany + all help or recommendations is greatly appreciated. My skin will forever be in your debt <3\n\n**Products:**\n\n* Muji Mild Oil Cleanser\n* Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser - *own + best cleanser for my skin!*\n* Tiam My Signature Vita B5 Toner\n* Aprilskin Artemisia Rice Toner\n* Make P:rem Safe Me. Relief Toner\n* Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner\n* Vegreen Fragrance-Free Nature Mucin Serum\n* Iunik Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n* Benton Fermentation Essence\n* ~~Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water~~\n* Dr. Ceuracle Vegan Kombucha Tea Essence\n* Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule - *own + adore - redness who?*\n* Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence\n* RNW Der. Concentrate Ceramide Plus Serum\n* Cosrx Full Fit Propolis Light Cream (day)\n* Purito B5 Panthenol Rebarrier Cream (night)\n* Purito Dermide Cica Sleeping Pack - *own. like but need a moisturizer under.*\n* Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics - *own.*\n* Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 - *own. no white cast. i'm still pale somehow.*\n\nEdit: Two days ago I was lost. I am now found. My faith in humanity is restored. I hope your depression is cured, you're moisturized, your coffee is always hot, and you never get breakouts again. \n\nThanks so much for all the recommendations.

    "body": "I’m honestly at my breaking point. Two months ago, I had zero eye problems. I was focused on my life, my career, and had no idea what floaters even were. And now, I’m here — 20 years old, with 50+ floaters, eye pain, pressure, sleepless nights, and thousands spent on eye appointments. And it all started with one f**ng $3 eye drop.\n\nhow this nightmare started:\n\nI had mild irritation from dust/contacts, so I visited a local eye doctor, who told me everything was fine and casually prescribed me a lubricating eye drop (Systear) with preservatives, made in Bangladesh. He told me to use it for a month — nobody warns you that preservative-containing drops aren’t safe for long-term use. I trusted him and used it for two weeks, mostly in my right eye.\n\nThat drop wrecked me.\n\nSoon after, my eyes went completely dry. Then came the first floater. Then more. I stopped the drops immediately, but it was too late. Things just kept spiraling. Now I have:\n\n- Severe floaters in the right eye (50+ and getting darker/bigger)\n- Moderate floaters in the left\n- Eye pain that shifts between dull and stabbing\n- Pressure and numbness around the right eye and side of my head and sometimes in the left eye aswell.\n- Discomfort on eye movement, especially to the side\n- Mild visual snow when waking up\n- Mild Blurred vision\n- occasional sharp light flickers (maybe due to tension)\n- Floaters forming into hair-like tangled shapes or small balls\n- Pain worsens at night or when sneezing, bending down, or in wind\n\nI’ve now spent hundreds on exams, including a dilated eye exam yesterday. The retina specialist said:\n\n- No retinal tears or detachment as of now\n- Not sure if it’s PVD or early vitreous change\n- Saw a artificated colored cell in the vitreous area (still monitoring)\n\n- Acknowledged that the prescribed drop might’ve caused ocular trauma or allergic inflammation - but still confused \n\nThen, I was prescribed Nevanac (Nepafenac 0.1%) — an anti-inflammatory drop with *Benzalkonium Chloride preservative* again. I’m scared to even put it in my eye. I already feel like a walking experiment.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is that this started over a cheap, unregulated drop, and now I feel like my life is ruined. I can’t watch a movie all I see is floaters, I can't drive at night the floaters make the lights opaque, can’t sleep properly, no trips or swimming, no roller coaster rides and I live every day anxious about whether my retina is going to tear or whether this is the start of vision issues.\n\nI even wrote a full letter to my current eye doctor (I’ve attached the link), explaining everything. told me to come again in 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ENBR9cc\n\nI asked about eye pressure — it was normal.\nI’m angry. I’m exhausted. And I feel like no one really understands how terrifying and lonely this feels. I feel betrayed by the first doctor who casually told me to use those garbage drops. I’ve read everywhere online: “Never trust eye products from developing countries”, and I wish I listened.\n\nIf you’ve gone through anything similar, please share your story. Help me understand what’s going on, or what I should push for at my next appointment.\n\nI’m just 20. I shouldn’t be this scared of losing my vision.  \nI just want my peace back.\n\n",

They made my kiddo cry and then I tried them on myself and was so surprised people like them!! They are my biggest Costco flop to date. \n\nThe most granola option I liked was the thick napkin like dry wipes with just plain water on them as needed.  Plus side, they’re fully biodegradable. \n\nOur favorite wipes are Huggies cucumber and green tea. Not so granola, but for things like sticky hands and faces, they are our hands down favorite. The fragrance is light and fresh, they don’t burn and no soapy residue.",

I miss the original WaterWipes though.",

I spent over two hour every single day cleaning the house with the proper disinfectant.\n\nI did this for 45 freaking days!\n\nFor 45 days I had to keep my cats locked in a single room to contain the germ! For 45 days I couldn't fucking pet the cats that I love from fear of spreading this fucking germ all over my house!\n\nAfter these 45 days, they were cured. No more blood in the stool!\n\nI let them out in the house just a month ago and had been super happy with their presence... But tonight, as I went to clean the litter box, there it was... The same bloody poop they had before.\n\nI CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE IT.\n\nThis fucking germ made my and my cats' lives a living hell for 45 fucking days!\n\nI hosnetly don't don't know what to do... I can't cry or yell enough. I'm fully defeated.\n\nI can't believe I'll have to go through this fucking treatment all over again, and that I'll have to lock them up again, FUCK!\n\nSeems the only treatment will be burning down my apartment and moving. Nothing else will help.\n\nAnyway... Thanks for listening or reading or whatever, I just really needed to get this off my chest. I'm gonna go try to have some sleep before I have to take them to the vet tomorrow. Bye\n\n---------------------**IMPORTANT EDIT**---------------------\n\nIf you found this post while looking for advice, this edit is for you!\n\nThere is a solution! The giardia *will* go away, and you fur babies *will* be fine!\n\nI'm posting here a detailed guide on what worked for me and my cats in relation to the giardia. Hopefully this will also help anyone reading this post in the future to beat this awful disease.\n\nThere is a catch, though... It will suck, for a while. The next 10 days will be really bad, but you must not despair. With the tools I list below you'll be able to effectively fight this parasite and get your life back to normal.\n\nDisclaimer: I'M NOT A VET! I went to at least 10 vets when trying to cure my cats from giardisis, and these are some of the things they've recommended, I'm just recounting what worked for me.\n\nI'll mention some products that are available in Brazil, because that's where I live. I'll use scientific names because brands will vary from place to place, but if you can find products with the same active compound, they should work perfectly fine\n\nPart 1: Medication\n\nI had my cats take at least 4 different types of medication, the only one that worked was a combination of **Metronidazole 50mg and Sulfadimethoxine 50mg** (it was one pill). It was the most expensive medication on the market, but it worked like a charm, so I'm not complaining.\n\nPart 2: Sterilization\n\nThe biggest problem with giardia is reinfection. You kill the bugs inside of your cat, [but cysts persist in environment for a long time](https://stellinamarfa.com/meat/how-long-does-giardia-stay-alive-on-surfaces/)¹, and they can get reinfected. This is especially true for your cats paws. They will poop, cover their poop, get cysts from the poop onto their paws, lick their paws, and get reinfected.\n\n^^^^1 ^^^^apparently ^^^^it's ^^^^about ^^^^a ^^^^week ^^^^for ^^^^relatively ^^^^dry ^^^^surfaces, ^^^^but ^^^^up ^^^^to ^^^^several ^^^^months ^^^^in ^^^^moist ^^^^surfaces ^^^^like ^^^^dirt. \n\nI used **Benzalkonium Chloride**, diluted according to manufacturer's instructions. Bought a cheap pulverizer at a gardening store and just pulverized the disinfectant everywhere my cats could reach.\n\nLitterboxes are especially problematic and must be completely emptied and sterilized after every poop. Throw away any excess litter that was in the box. Alternatively, buy a bunch of single use catering trays and use those as temporary litterboxes, then instead of having to constantly disinfect, you can just thrown them away. As a final tip on litterboxes, you might want to drastically reduce the amount of litter you use since you'll be changing the whole thing so often.\n\nNow, remember when I said this thing was gonna suck for you? Well, here's the main reason for that:\nSince you have to sterilize every surface that might be contaminated with giardia cysts, and - since infected cats keep on contaminating every surface they touch - the best thing I did was to lock the cats in a room for the ten days. That way, I only had to sterilize that room every day instead of my entire house.\n\nThis was brutal for the well-being of the cats and my mental health, but it had to be done. Think about your house and every place in it that your cat can reach, and think if you'd have the time and patience to THOROUGHLY clean every nook and cranny every single day. Cleaning one room was a lot, cleaning the entire house is just beyond what a single human can do. \n\nSo yeah, containing the cats is probably something you unfortunately might have to consider. 10 days in a room followed by a lifetime of happy moments seems to me like a better option than constant suffering from getting reinfected by this bug.\n\nLastly, food and water bowls were also disinfected with **near boiling water**. Just let the bowls soak in the hot water for a few minutes every day and you're good.\n\nPart 3: I'm here for you\n\nI know better than anyone how much this germ fucking sucks, and how it's like to feel helpless after another reinfection.\n\nSo, while this may not count for much, I want to say that I'm here for you. If you need to talk or just vent, my DMs are open.\n\nThanks for reading, and good luck!",

There seems to be little evidence-based advice given to health care workers about this, or if there is advice it will often be conflicting.

Will regular laundry detergent and a cold wash be adequate to remove them from my uniform?\n2. Is bleach the only thing that will remove C-Diff spores? (not suitable for coloured uniform).\n3. Would it be useful to use a Benzalkonium Chloride laundry rinse?\n4. Are alcohol wipes suitable for disinfecting personal equipment and surfaces?\n5. Are commonly discussed alternative cleaning agents such as vinegar actually useful against these microbes?\n6.

Each disinfectant will have different times required. You should inquire with them about this. \n\n2. Bleach isn't the only one, but I don't know any clothing safe compound. We use a peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide mix for example.  Does your hospital have a garment cleaning service that would autoclave or irradiate your clothes? That's what we use. \n\n3. Quats are good disinfectants for anything non spore forming. Again, contact time is important but this could help\n\n4. Yes, provided you aren't trying to kill spores, pseudomonads and that you use the right contact time. 70% is best since it doesn't evaporate as fast as, let's say, 90%. \n\n5. Yes. Vinegar is just acetic acid. In the right concentration, it works as well as any other acid.  As I said earlier, we use a mix of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide as a sporicide. It works very well. \n\n6. Microbes can't develop resistance to this. It's like dropping an asteroid on a city and having a few people survive. These people aren't gonna develop resistance to asteroids, no matter how often you do this. In contrast, antibiotics are like using a low dose of poison, over time. \n\nHope that helps.",

I asked for this medication specifically because I’ve been taking it over the last 3 years only during allergy season. On the 15th, I sprayed it once in each nostril. I instantly felt a lot of the medication in my throat and I swallowed it. The next day I woke up feeling dizzy with chest tightness and heart palpitations. I had eye twitches and I felt on onset of anxiety coming in for the first time in my life. I thought maybe this was all due to my inactivity from staying home a lot. So I didn’t think much of it. \n\nThe second night I used it the same way, one spray in each nostril. Again feeling the liquid in my throat and swallowed. The medication was helping with the allergies. However, my symptoms from the day before has gotten worse. \n\nThe third night I was about to stop taking it to see if maybe it was the Flonase that caused it. I decided against it. One spray in each nose and has that same feeling in my throat. Swallowed and went to bed. \n\nWoke up and I felt helpless. Depressed. I’ve never had these feelings before. I’m an overall healthy person l. I’m 21 years old. Male. \n\nI called my doc that day and told him if it’s possible that these side effects are from the Flonase. He just brushed it off and said no chance. I asked him if it’s possible that swallowing even a little bit of it could cause these symptoms. He said NOPE, not chance. Said it was probably some flu like virus, not the coronavirus. He said take 2 Advil’s each day for a week and call him back after. I couldn’t believe it. I stopped taking the Flonase. \n\nThe next morning I decided I’m going for a run to test it out and see if it’s just all in my head. I started running for a minute and my head felt light and my heart was racing, barely able to catch my breath. I walked home after that. \n\nI went online to search for answers and found two websites that held reviews for ‘Flonase’. I read hundred of reviews dating back all the way to 2003. Almost everyone highlighting the EXACT same symptoms as me. I felt some relief but at the same time, I didn’t see any update from these people on how they felt after stopping the medication. \n\nRight now it’s been almost three weeks since I stopped Flonase. I still feel the chest tightness. I fee the heart palpitations when making some extraneous body movements. I feel lack of energy still. I no longer feel the depression, or much of the anxiety. \n\nOverall, I’m just worried that I’m gonna have to live with those symptoms for the rest of my life. I don’t know. Apparently there’s this chemical in Flonase called benzalkonium chloride.

If you aren’t already doing that, go to YouTube and search for videos that show how to use it from a pharmacist or ENT.\n\n2) in addition to the angle, you should not be inhaling air strongly or snorting it. That gets it to the lungs where you don’t want it. You want the medication on the sinuses which are barely in the visible nose but more to the back and sides of it. Inhale gently and it won’t go away from those areas.\n\n3) after using it, there is usually some that will make its way to your mouth, throat, etc. You want to rinse it out, maybe gargle a little. I do this a few minutes after application. I will also use it as a chance to brush my teeth, which also removes some of the drainage. \n\n4) there could be some impact from the time of day you use it. I typically apply it 2-3 hours before I sleep and then again in the morning. Before you do so, make sure you’ve blown your nose to remove any buildup, and even consider showering before because the humidity helps with drainage as well.\n\nIt’s hard to comment on what you’re feeling with this, but I hope this helps.",

    "body": "Hey, everyone. I replied to a post here a little over a week ago, detailing my own personal experience with non-allergic rhinitis, and the sheer devastation that it has had on my quality of life. I felt it necessary to make that comment a post of its own for visibility’s sake, as I myself have had varying levels of success with a few of the named approaches. As I’m sure you all know, when it comes to this, any amount of relief, no matter how small, is appreciated.\n\n“Hey, OP. My heart goes out to you. I’ve been dealing with the exact same issue and have been trying my damndest for the last two years to figure it out. I actually suspect I’ve had this issue since I was a kid, but only became aware of it when it got bad enough to the point where I started waking up, gasping for breath, which began in fall 2023. Like you, it has wreaked absolute havoc on my sleep quality, and, consequently, literally every other facet of my life.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to say that I agree with you wholeheartedly that this is less so a traditional allergic response and more so the result of some kind of hormonal imbalance/autonomic nervous system dysfunction. That’s what I’ve gathered over the past two years. Assuming you aren’t suffering from asymptomatic GERD, which can also lead to inflamed sinuses, then I think an imbalance of neurotransmitters is the likely culprit.\n\nI’ve toyed around with taking things that increase GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and lower glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, and have found some success (and noted that foods higher in glutamic acid/glutamate most definitely make my turbinate hypertrophy worse). There are a number of different supplements that can do this. I’d advise you to talk with your doctor about them before supplementing, but I think you and I both know they’d likely dismiss you further and tell you not waste your money. Expensive urine and such, blah blah blah. Still, I’m going to recommend it, anyway.\n\nThe following is a list of supplements (and a key nutrient that everybody needs) that may possibly lower glutamate (and, by extension, raise GABA):\n\nVitamin B6 (P5P): This breaks down glutamate via glutamic acid decarboxylase; if impaired, glutamate levels will build up. Also breaks down histamine outside of the gut via HNMT\n\nL-Theanine\n\nTaurine\n\nMagnesium L-Threonate\n\nLithium Orotate: Not the same as the prescription drug. Also, a user here tried this at 5mg daily and found relief; went off it for a bit, and the rhinitis came right back\n\nAgmatine Sulfate\n\nNAC\n\nGotu Kola\n\nLemon Balm: Keeps GABA from breaking down via GABA transaminase\n\nProbiotics: Can also reduce histamine, which will help you if your issue stems from histamine intolerance; in which case, you’ll need both copper (I recommend MitoSynergy, though it’s expensive) and Vitamin C for diamine oxidase, which breaks down histamine in the gut. The probiotic Florastor also works to increase DAO. Two users here found relief from their congestion via Florastor). Btw, take copper away from Vitamin C. I believe they may compete for absorption.\n\nSince I’ve listed a bunch of stuff already, I might as well list other things that have worked for people:\n\nVitamin D3\n\nQuercetin and/or Bromelain\n\nNattokinase\n\nSerrapeptase\n\nNasalcrom: I believe this worked for me as well, but I stopped using it I was/am a bit wary of the preservative benzalkonium chloride; thankfully, I found a German alternative called Pollicrom, though I haven’t had quite as much success with it.\n\nSSRIs: This gives credence to the possibility of nonallergic rhinitis being caused by autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Or, simply, anxiety.\n\nOddly, Magnesium Glycinate completely eliminated this issue for me three years ago, before I was even aware I had a nighttime rhinitis issue. But I’m reasonably certain that it alleviated this issue because I will occasionally have the odd night where my nose remains totally open, and my sleep is far deeper, far more restful, as a result. Zero chance I would’ve slept that well if one or both nasal passages were closed. I’m also reasonably certain that it was the glycine component (another neurotransmitter) that was responsible, which has led me down the whole methylation pathway rabbit hole, which I still, frankly, don’t understand all that well. But if impaired methylation is to blame, you could try supplementing with Creatine and/or Sunflower Lecithin and other supplements (like SAM-e (a user here found success using this), TMG, B complex, and others) to try to directly or indirectly assist your methylation. I’d advise getting bloodwork and genetic testing done, so you’re not just playing the guessing game if/when you try out these approaches.\n\nBack to the MagGly, I ultimately had to bail on it since it started giving me very strange headaches; as if lit cigarettes were being applied to my brain. I suspect this was due to the glycine, which for me might have led to something known as glutamate excitotoxicity. This can happen in susceptible individuals, but it doesn’t appear to be very common. I’m currently trying to see if I can, perhaps, combine MagGly with one of those glutamate-lowering supplements I listed above, so that I can again reap with rewards of the glycine without incurring any of the drawbacks.\n\nLast thing I’ll say is that recently I’ve started looking into yet another neurotransmitter called norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline). From what little I’ve read so far, it appears that there’s a very curious connection between low norepinephrine and incidence of nasal congestion due to swollen nasal turbinates. Haven’t tested this out myself, yet, but when I do, I intend to supplement with copper and Vitamin C, as they are both cofactors for the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which converts dopamine to norepinephrine.\n\nApologies for the novel. But I had been meaning to make a post on here for a while, and your desperation is palpable (and relatable). I sincerely hope this helps.”\n\nAs always, I hope this helps. And if/when the day comes where I find something that I know for sure helps or, better yet, completely alleviates the issue, that will be the day the rest of you know as well. Until then.",

In the past week, I've seen a few commenter's approach NAR in what I would consider \"the correct way\" (which rings true for any chronic illness) -- seeing the body as a full system, rather than isolated parts. You are absolutely correct that hormones and the nervous system are contributors to this.\n\nMy only note here for people reading is that supplementation is great, but only if two things are true: 1) you don't have something like leaky gut, where the stuff you're putting in your body (including food!) isn't going to where it should be, and 2) your blood and lymph flow is functioning as close to normal as possible (it's not normal if you have NAR).\n\nSupplements won't work very well if they can't get to where they're supposed to go because of a gut issue, or if when they get there, your cells can't get the nutrients due to stagnant fluid flow.\n\nI think people would be surprised how working their abdomen with basic massage, palpating the liver and spleen for lymphatic backup, and checking their kidneys for inflammation regularly would teach them about basic problems they can work on with their hands rather than a surgery. It may take them farther, too.\n\nGodspeed.",

I personally think it's got something to do with the nerves in your nose being oversensitive and they sometimes tell your body to produce mucus when it's not needed. But hey I'm no medical expert. I don't think it's food related and I haven't been able to link it with any food groups. The medical websites all say the same thing.\n\nMy NAR tends to play up when there's a temperature change, air blowing on me and sometimes for no reason whatsoever. It causes an irritating post nasal drip cough that's been annoying the hell out of me for years. I don't like fans and air conditioners as they tend to bring it on. It's tough because I work in an airconditioned office so I just have to put up with it. \n\nI think NAR tends to be hereditary and my brother has similar problems to me although not exactly the same. My doctor said everyone's NAR is slightly different and most people have a mix of both non-allergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis. \n\nI tend to fluctuate from having a few good weeks and then a few bad weeks. I don't know why. The only method I've found to reduce its symptoms is to blow my nose, apply capsaicin to my nostrils with a cotton bud and then take the Dymista nasal spray (azelastine / fluticasone combination). I follow this routine twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night before bed. This really helps and I would estimate it reduces symptoms by 70-80%. The pesty condition still hangs around though but is less severe.  When it's really bad I'll sometimes do a mid-day application of capsaicin from my office draw stash. There is lots of information on the internet about the use of capsaicin to help with NAR. I think it comes down to experimenting with different dosages and application frequencies to see what works best for you.",

I expect to be diluting for another 2 months, taking my time and letting my sinuses adjust as they go.\n\nI wanted to share a dilution method I learned from an amazing group I found, if anyone is having troubles with where to start or how to measure I got the guide for you. Firstly I suggest buying 2 bottles of afrin, preferably the pump mist bottle. You can also use any type of spray you're on as long as you have the 30ml Afrin Bottle. Go to a pharmacy and ask for a 10ml syringe, next buy some Saline packets or store saline bottles although please avoid anything with benzalkonium chloride, this causes rebound and can stop your progress.\n\nNow for the actual dilution part, a bottle has 30ml of afrin, that means 3ml is 10%. You can start at whatever comfort level is best for you, I started at 90% which is 27ml Afrin 3ml Saline. Go down accordingly and dont rush yourself, I did that and got very very frustrated. Personally I dilute 10% when I'm able to go 4 hours without spraying. Please please do not mix any mixtures, I usually finish the bottle but if you want to cut down quicker dump out the mixture and re measure, it's more accurate this way. If you need more bottles of afrin buy em! I've bought over 10 already during this dilution process. \n\nDilution method really does work well and for some it doesnt which is okay, I remember before I started diluting I was sleeping 1hr every night, not eating anymore and my heart rate was constantly at 125 or above. Now 3 weeks later, I feel normal. Not completely normal but I'm about 75% there. I highly recommend this method for anyone who cant stand not breathing out of their nose, it's really helped me and I'm only half way there. Hope anyone reading this can get the help and support they need! You could try this method instead of rhinostat if you're on the severe spray kind, as rhinostat doesnt work if you use menthol.",

The gloves are nitrile, to avoid latex allergies. Put one pair on right away, to keep your hands clean. Leave this bag sealed as much as possible. If you get sprayed, DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE. Pull open the bag and then strip off your gloves. Open the water and tilt your head and body as far as you can to the right; pour water into your right eye. Then tilt to the left and rinse your left eye. Use any water that's left to rinse out your mouth (DON'T SWALLOW). Blink and spit as much as you can, and call for a medic. Use the eye drops to keep rinsing your eyes; 1 drop in each eye every 15 to 30 seconds.\"\n\nEDIT: it should be pointed out that most commercially available hand sanitizers contain alcohol, as do (obviously) alcohol wipes. Some people have religious or other objections to the use of products containing alcohol. There are wipes and sanitizing gels that use benzalkonium chloride (commonly abbreviated BZK) instead. They are generally about as effective as alcohol-based products when used properly, but expect to pay a bit more. Also, just because a product contains BZK does not mean it is necessarily alcohol-free; check the label.",

    "body": "The literature is current through Dec 2012.  This is copy and pasted from the ICD topic.\n\n\n\n**INTRODUCTION** \n\n\n Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is a localized inflammatory skin response to a wide range of chemical or physical agents. ICD results from direct cytotoxic effect of irritants; unlike allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) it is not immune mediated. ICD is a multifactorial disorder influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the irritating substance, host-related susceptibility factors, and environmental factors.\n\n\nThe clinical manifestations of ICD are similar to those of other acute or chronic eczematous dermatitides, including atopic dermatitis and ACD.\n\n\nThis topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of ICD in adults. Atopic dermatitis and ACD are discussed separately.\n\n\n\n**EPIDEMIOLOGY** \n\n\nIrritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is the most common type of contact dermatitis. ICD represents approximately 80 percent of occupational contact dermatitis and is considered the most frequent cause of hand eczema [1,2]. In the general population, the estimated prevalence of hand eczema is about 4 percent; women are more frequently affected than men [2]. The risk of occupational ICD is highest among those with \"wet work\" exposures such as food handlers, healthcare workers, mechanical industry workers, cleaners, and housekeepers (table 1) [3].\n\n\n**PATHOGENESIS** \n\n Multiple mechanisms, some of which are not completely understood, are involved in the development of ICD, including [4]:\n\n* Disruption of the epidermal barrier\n* Damage of cell membranes\n* Cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes\n* Cytokine release from keratinocytes\n* Activation of innate immunity\n\n\nThe disruption of the epidermal barrier (stratum corneum) by chemical or physical irritants, resulting in increased skin permeability and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), is considered the initiating event of ICD.\n\n\nIn experimental animal and human models, the acute disruption of the epidermal barrier from exposure to surfactants (eg, sodium lauryl sulfate) induces the release of preformed cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from keratinocytes [5-8]. IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha act as primary signals for the release of proinflammatory chemokines (eg, CCL20, CCL21, and CXCL8), which attract mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells at the site of injury [8,9]. In addition, TNF-alpha induces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM-1) on keratinocytes, which promote the infiltration of leukocytes into the epidermis.\n\n\nAntiinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are also released in response to irritant exposure and may be involved in the resolution of the inflammatory process [10].\n\n\nThe pathogenesis of chronic ICD is not completely understood. One hypothesis is that chronic exposure to mild irritants or wet work down-regulates the inflammatory response and stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. A few studies have compared the cytokine levels in normal skin and in skin areas repeatedly exposed to sodium lauryl sulfate. In chronically irritated skin, the levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha were lower and the levels of IL-1 RA were higher than those measured in nonirritated skin [10,11].\n\n\nSome individuals develop a tolerance to chronic exposure to irritants. The adaptation of the skin to repeated irritant exposures is called the hardening phenomenon. The mechanisms underlying the hardening phenomenon are unknown. Irritant-induced changes in skin morphology (eg, acanthosis and hyperkeratosis), lipid composition of the stratum corneum, barrier permeability, and expression of inflammatory mediators may contribute [12,13].\n\n\n**PREDISPOSING FACTORS** \n\nThe development of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is influenced by host-related and environmental factors.\n\n* Host-related factors\n\n **1.**  **Age** — The skin reactivity to irritants is highest in infants and tends to decrease with age. The reactivity to irritants is lower among individuals >65 years than in those <30 years [14].\nSex — The prevalence of ICD in general and of hand dermatitis in particular is greater in women than in men. However, the higher risk in women is probably due to increased domestic and occupational exposure to detergents and “wet work” rather than to genuine sex differences in susceptibility [2]. The clearance rate and prognosis are similar in men and women [15].\n\n\n **2** **Body site** — The response to irritants varies from site to site on the body, reflecting differences in the thickness of the stratum corneum and barrier function. The face, dorsum of the hands, and finger webs are more prone to irritation from chemical substances than the palms, soles, or back [1,16].\n\n\n **3.** **Atopy** — Individuals with atopic dermatitis have a chronically impaired barrier function that increases their susceptibility to irritants [17,18]. In a population based study of patients with occupational skin disease, 64 percent of the subjects with ICD reported a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis or had typical and/or minor signs of atopic dermatitis [19].\n\n\n **4.** **Genetic factors** — Twin studies indicate that genetic factors other than atopy (eg, cytokine gene polymorphisms) may influence the susceptibility to ICD [20]. Individuals with a low threshold for the irritant effect of sodium lauryl sulfate and benzalkonium chloride have a high prevalence of a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) gene polymorphism that is correlated with increased TNF-alpha production [21,22].\n\n\n* Environmental factors — Environmental factors such as temperature, air flow, humidity, and occlusion affect the skin response to irritants [23].\n\n\nHigh temperatures and air flow appear to decrease the skin barrier function and increase the penetration of irritants such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a surfactant contained in many detergents) [24-26]. Cold temperatures and low ambient humidity increase the transepidermal water loss and the skin susceptibility to irritants [27,28].\n\n\nIncreased humidity (eg, sweating from prolonged wearing of occlusive gloves) can disrupt the skin barrier and enhance the inflammatory response to chemical or mechanical irritants [29].\n\n\n**COMMON IRRITANTS** \n\nIrritants are physical or chemical agents that are capable of producing cellular perturbation if applied to the skin for sufficient time and in sufficient concentration. Common chemical irritants include water and wet work, detergents and surfactants, solvents, oxidizing agents, acids, and alkalis. Physical irritants include metal tools, wood, fiberglass, plant parts, paper, and dust or soil. Occupations at high risk for irritant contact dermatitis and common irritants encountered are listed in the table (table 1) [3].\n\n\n**MECHANISM OF ACTION OF IRRITANTS** \n\n\n The level of irritancy for an individual substance depends upon its chemical properties (eg, acid dissociation constant, ionization status, molecular size, or liposolubility) and the duration of the contact [1]. High concentrations of most chemicals are sufficient to induce an irritant reaction in almost all individuals, whereas mild irritants may induce an inflammatory response only in susceptible individuals or after repeated or prolonged contact [31].\n\n\nDifferent chemicals may act synergistically in inducing dermatitis. Solvents remove the lipids from the stratum corneum whereas detergents remove both lipids and hygroscopic (water holding) substances (eg, filaggrin breakdown products). The combined exposure to solvents and detergents produces an additive effect [32].\n\n\n\n\n\n*continued in thread*\n",

        "body": "**Chemical irritants**\n\n* Water and wet work - Water is hypotonic and acts as a cytotoxic agent on eroded skin. On intact skin, prolonged contact with water causes swelling of the stratum corneum, disruption of the intercellular lipids, and enhancement of skin permeability and susceptibility to irritants [33]. Wet work is defined as skin exposure to liquids or wearing occlusive gloves more than two hours daily or hand washing or disinfection more than 20 times daily [34]. Food handling and preparation, healthcare-related occupations, cleaning, and hairdressing are examples of wet work.\n* Detergents and surfactants — Detergents used for domestic and industrial cleaning remove lipids and hygroscopic substances in the stratum corneum, denature proteins, and damage the cell membranes.\n* Solvents — Solvents remove lipids and hygroscopic substances and damage cell membranes. Their irritating capacity depends upon their chemical structure: aromatic solvents (eg, benzene or toluene) are stronger irritants than alcohols or ketones (eg, acetone).\n* Oxidizing agents — Oxidizing agents, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or benzoyl peroxide are cytotoxic agents\n* Acids — Strong acids (eg, sulphuric acid) cause protein coagulation and cell necrosis.\n* Alkalis--Alkaline solutions saponify the surface lipids, dissolve water-holding substances, break the cross-linkages of keratin, and cause swelling of cells. Soap, soda, ammonia, potassium and sodium hydroxides, cement, and chalk are examples of alkaline substances.\n\n\n**Physical irritants** \n\nChronic microtrauma or friction damages the stratum corneum, impairs the skin barrier, and induces the release of preformed cytokines from keratinocytes [35]. Physical agents that may cause skin irritation include [36-38]:\n\n\n* Metal tools\n* Wood\n* Fiberglass\n* Plant parts (eg, thorns, spines, sharp-edged leaves) [36,37]\n* Paper\n* Dust/soil\n\n\nPhysical irritants may act synergistically with chemical irritants, such as detergents or water, in inducing a more severe disruption of the skin barrier [29].\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT**  Please note that this differs from Allergic Contact Dermatitis, Atopic Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Fungal Infection, Scabies, and Hand Eczema..... These are the \"differential\" Diagnoses which mean they need to be \"differentiated\" from ICD.",

    "body": "I recently discovered something that hasn't been discussed here before: the use of Berberine (BBR), whether through oral supplementation or as eye drops. Reddit User u/handsoffdick shared in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1auadje/wtf_probiotics_cured_my_anxiety_dry_eye_stomach/) how oral berberine alleviated his dry eye condition.\n\nBerberine is a yellow-colored alkaloid found in several plant species such as barberry (*Berberis vulgaris*), goldenseal (*Hydrastis canadensis*), Chinese goldthread (*Coptis chinensis*), and Oregon grape (*Mahonia aquifolium*). It's been utilized for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine and other healing traditions for various ailments. Known for its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, BBR presents a wide array of pharmacological benefits.\n\nA [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37748390/) from December 2023 delves into the therapeutic effects of BBR eye drops on DED. The study examines BBR's benefits through in vitro tests on human corneal epithelium cells, in vivo studies in a dry eye murine model, and network pharmacology analysis, providing strong evidence that BBR can significantly reduce inflammation and apoptosis in DED by modulating key signaling pathways.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* BBR improves corneal cell viability under stress conditions similar to DED.\n* In a mouse model, BBR eye drops decreased inflammation, T-cell infiltration, protected the ocular surface, and reduced MMP-3 and MMP-9 levels, enzymes that contribute to tissue remodeling and inflammation.\n* Network pharmacology analysis pinpointed 148 common targets between BBR and DED, hinting at BBR's potential multi-target therapeutic effects, including the PI3K/AKT/NFκB and MAPK pathways, crucial in managing inflammation and apoptosis.\n* Molecular docking analysis confirmed strong interactions between BBR and these core targets, supporting its modulatory capabilities on these pathways.\n\nIn addition, [this publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-00456-5) from 2021 and [this study](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/fo/d0fo02984j) demonstrate the impact of oral BBR on gut microbiota and how it, alongside probiotics and prebiotics, can offer a novel approach to treating dry eye symptoms by modulating gut inflammation and microbiota.\n\nHowever, finding suitable berberine chloride eye drops has been challenging due to the presence of Benzalkonium chloride in available products like [Murine Relief](https://murine.com.au/product/murine-relief/), which can actually induce dry eyes... Note that Berberil drops, ending with an \"l,\" are unrelated to berberine.\n\nGiven the evidence, I'm considering trying oral berberine supplementation to see if it offers relief for dry eyes.",

This is because it stays on.  I'm always wrapping cuts on my finger with it, it protects the cut and keeps things from getting worse by re-injury. It will stop bleeding,  a daub of antiseptic cream held under it stays put, it can support a cut on a finger joint so it can't move and re-injure. There are many situations where a real bandage is better, but if you need to keep nasty water and dirt out of something there's nothing better.  \n\nI'm also a fan of Naproxen Sodium as a painkiller.  When I was having chronic headaches, my own tests of one OTC painkiller vs another put Naproxen on top.  It is my go-to for sore muscles and anything to do with inflammation, but it seems to be more slow acting than the other analgesics.  \n\nI keep a couple kinds of OTC allergy medicine - Loratidine and Certrizine, as well as some eye drops for allergies as my eyes sometimes goop up.  \n\nI debate bringing an Epipen.  I'd  totally bring one if we knew someone needed it.  I've used an Epipen on someone and the ambulance driver said it may have saved her life.  On the other hand they are expensive, short use-by date, and if nobody is known to be allergic to beestings probably not necessary.  \n\nI put in an Ace bandage in case someone sprains an ankle - it might help them limp through portages vs being unable to walk.  \n\nInstead of Tums, I have some OTC Omeprazol with Sodium Bicarbonate.  Works the same, does a better job against heartburn, and Tums are sugary which makes you want to eat too many of them.  They don't really work very well or for very long.",

I have tried about a million, and I'll share with you the ones I like, but they are all aerosol.\n\nFor anyone using Batiste, you might look into this lawsuit against them over high levels of Benzene in their products: [https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/batiste-dry-shampoo-cancer-lawsuit.html](https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/batiste-dry-shampoo-cancer-lawsuit.html)\n\nI had also remember this news coming out about a ton of dry shampoos being recalled over high levels of Benzene, including Not Your Mother's: [https://time.com/6227492/dry-shampoo-benzene-cancer/](https://time.com/6227492/dry-shampoo-benzene-cancer/)\n\nI am trying to find the list that came out, and I remember being really disappointed because my absolute favorite dry shampoo was not on the \"clean\" list, but it is literally the best dry shampoo for me, so I still use it but try to use it sparingly and only in an open area where I can immediately walk away and avoid breathing it in:  \n[IGKFirst Class Charcoal Detox Dry Shampoo](https://www.sephora.com/product/first-class-charcoal-detox-dry-shampoo-P429264?skuId=2030690&icid2=products%20grid:p429264:product)\n\nWhen that news hit about the dry shampoos, Moroccan Oil's was on the \"clean\" list so I started using that instead, and it also works really well and was among my favorites. It also comes in a dark tones for brunettes (it does have a fresh soapy scent, though, that can be a little strong): [MoroccanoilDry Shampoo Dark Tones](https://www.sephora.com/product/dry-shampoo-dark-tones-P412098?skuId=1873835&icid2=products%20grid:p412098:product)\n\nI am currently working my way through a huge bottle of this [R+Co Bleu Dry Shampoo](https://bluemercury.com/products/r-co-bleu-retroactive-dry-shampoo?variant=39734762504267&currency=USD&utm_content=R%2BCo+Bleu+Retroactive+Dry+Shampoo&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=shopping&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PMax:G_Bluemercury_Shopping_Smart-2&s_kwcid=AL!18664!3!!!!x!!&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwxqayBhDFARIsAANWRnQgaQtgzVRbuzGnSyRSob2DVm-nQW0QPRXiUgUU5RCkwf7wcbQEXdAaAld6EALw_wcB) which is also supposedly \"clean\" and doesn't have a scent and doesn't show up too much on my dark brown hair. It might be a good fit for you. I do think the IGK works better, but like I mentioned...I try not to use it all of the time because I think it has been shown to have higher levels of chemicals in the past.\n\nSomeone else also mentioned [Klorane](https://www.kloraneusa.com/dry-shampoo) and I do think that is another solid clean aerosol option without a strong scent. Klorane also has a non-aerosol version that I haven't actually tried, so might be worth checking out. \n\nI am trying to find that list for you -- if someone has it, post it -- but I remember a list being released of all the dry shampoos and their levels of various chemicals. Needless to say, I remember having to throw a ton away.\n\nAll of this is to say....definitely be careful about the products you are using and if something is bothering you, trust your body and stop using it!",

    "body": "I’m honestly at my breaking point. Two months ago, I had zero eye problems. I was focused on my life, my career, and had no idea what floaters even were. And now, I’m here — 20 years old, with 50+ floaters, eye pain, pressure, sleepless nights, and thousands spent on eye appointments. And it all started with one f**ng $3 eye drop.\n\nhow this nightmare started:\n\nI had mild irritation from dust/contacts, so I visited a local eye doctor, who told me everything was fine and casually prescribed me a lubricating eye drop (Systear) with preservatives, made in Bangladesh. He told me to use it for a month — nobody warns you that preservative-containing drops aren’t safe for long-term use. I trusted him and used it for two weeks, mostly in my right eye.\n\nThat drop wrecked me.\n\nSoon after, my eyes went completely dry. Then came the first floater. Then more. I stopped the drops immediately, but it was too late. Things just kept spiraling. Now I have:\n\n- Severe floaters in the right eye (50+ and getting darker/bigger)\n- Moderate floaters in the left\n- Eye pain that shifts between dull and stabbing\n- Even a sneeze makes my eyes bl00dy red\n- Pressure and numbness around the right eye and side of my head and sometimes in the left eye aswell.\n- Discomfort on eye movement, especially to the side\n- Mild visual snow when waking up\n- Mild Blurred vision\n- occasional sharp light flickers (maybe due to tension)\n- Floaters forming into hair-like tangled shapes or small balls\n- Pain worsens at night or when sneezing, bending down, or in wind\n\nI’ve now spent hundreds on exams, including a dilated eye exam yesterday. The retina specialist said:\n\n- No retinal tears or detachment as of now\n- Not sure if it’s PVD or early vitreous change\n- Saw a artificated colored cell in the vitreous area (still monitoring)\n\n- Acknowledged that the prescribed drop might’ve caused ocular trauma or allergic inflammation - but still confused \n\nThen, I was prescribed Nevanac (Nepafenac 0.1%) — an anti-inflammatory drop with Benzalkonium Chloride preservative again. I’m scared to even put it in my eye. I already feel like a walking experiment.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most is that this started over a cheap, unregulated drop, and now I feel like my life is ruined. I can’t watch a movie all I see is floaters, I can't drive at night the floaters make the lights opaque, can’t sleep properly, no trips or swimming, no roller coaster rides and I live every day anxious about whether my retina is going to tear or whether this is the start of vision issues.\n\nI even wrote a full letter to my current eye doctor (I’ve attached the link), explaining everything. told me to come again in 2 weeks.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/ENBR9cc\n\nI asked about eye pressure — it was normal.\nI’m angry. I’m exhausted. And I feel like no one really understands how terrifying and lonely this feels. I feel betrayed by the first doctor who casually told me to use those garbage drops. I’ve read everywhere online: “Never trust eye products from developing countries”, and I wish I listened.\n\nIf you’ve gone through anything similar, please share your story. Help me understand what’s going on, or what I should push for at my next appointment.\n\nI’m just 20. I shouldn’t be this scared of losing my vision.  \nI just want my peace back.\n",

I’ve been making an effort to focus on real things around me instead of screens.\n* Exercise makes a difference too. I aim for at least 30 minutes, 3-5 times a week. It helps with general well-being, even circulation, and stress.\n* I stopped looking at my phone in bed (especially on my side), and I avoid screens that are too bright. I just adjust the brightness until it feels comfortable.\n* If you use eye drops, I recommend Refresh Eye Plus—they’re preservative-free and work well, especially if you spend a lot of time on the computer.\n* Getting enough sleep (around 8 hours if you can) is important too.\n* Stress can cause inflammation and other issues, so if you’re dealing with a lot of stress, that could be related. Sometimes sinus issues can also affect your eyes, so it might be worth checking that out.\n* Are you using glasses? If not, maybe consider an eye exam if you’re having discomfort. Usually eye strain is for much screen, too many books, focused activities, dry eyes or maybe lack of vitamines.\n\nTry these and comment back in one month or after some weeks, I'm pretty sure you will find a difference, friend.

In addition, I took a lot of vitamins and began to sleep more and walk more. \n\n\n\nFloaters can disappear over time, it's true. Besides, maybe you should check your neurology, your brain, do an MRI scan, or your circulatory system? Perhaps you've been poisoned by something, and it's NOT eye drops? If I were you, I'd check the blood, the brain, done an ultrasound of the eyes, an MRI scan, and I would go to neurologist and a neuro-ophthalmologist.\n\n\n\nThe problem is that everything you described was hardly caused by cheap drops. It's very doubtful. Perhaps you should see another doctor and go to another clinic. If you have already done this, an additional opinion would not hurt, since your current doctor is at a loss and does not give complete answers. I'm sorry about spending money, it's extremely unpleasant, but health is definitely not something worth saving on.\n\n\n\nI wish you a full recovery and find a good specialist.

Every year they always say there's a huge spike, when in reality, it's usually no worse than the previous year.\n\nI follow the CDC Norovirus maps to get an idea of what's going on.\n[This map here](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reporting/calicinet/data.html) shows a state by state data of recorded outbreaks over the last number of months.\n\n[This graph](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reporting/norostat/data.html) shows a line of data, dating all the way back to 2012 so you can visually see how this year compares to previous years.\n\nThey don't update these maps too often, but I have found them very useful to see what's really going on.\n\nOther than that, what can you do to prevent yourself from getting sick?\nLots of things!\nFirst off, wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap.\ntraditional hand sanitizer will not kill noro, but if you can find anything with the ingredient \"benzalkonium chloride\", it still won't eliminate your chances entirely, but it is far more effective at killing it than standard hand sanitizer with alcohol.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable going out, you can wear a mask. Again, it won't completely eliminate the risk, but noro is transmitted by ingesting the pathogen, so having something cover your face can help a lot.\n\nGrapeseed pills. The last time noro went through my house, the doctor told me to take Grapeseed supplements. The theory is that is makes the lining of your stomach more slick, so the virus can't adhere as well, and will just slip out. Again, not foolproof, but it's worth a shot, and [here's an article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121108195701.htm) talking about it's effectiveness.\n\nIf anyone else would like to add anything to this list, please let me know!",

    "body": "Hey all, so it's that time of year again, and unfortunately, this seems to be a tough one.\n\nI'm sure a lot of you here have seen the news reports from various places that noro is in a surge right now.\n\nLet's talk about what's going on, and what you can do about it.\n\n\n\nFirst off, if you're here in the US, I'm going to post the CDC maps for this so you can keep track of what's going on.\n\n[This is a map of the US, where you can track outbreaks by individual states.](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/calicinet-data.html) This shows data over the last year, and hasn't been updated for a few months, so it's not the most accurate, but I still want to post it here as a resource. Edit: As of January 3rd 2025, this map has now been updated to show stats from September 1st 2024, to December 31st 2024.\n\n[This is a graph showing the trend of the virus from 2012 - 2024.](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html) This graph allows you to see how this has trended over the years, and is also updated a lot more frequently. \n\nSo now what are some things you can do to prevent this?\n\n* 1 - If you're going out, wear a mask. Wash your hands frequently, and try to avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose if possible. This will significantly help with exposure.\n\n\n* 2 - Alcohol based hand sanitizer *will not* kill noro. You need to get a hand sanitizer that has \"benzalkonium chloride\" in it. Studies have shown that this can kill noro. So if you can't properly wash your hands, this is the next best thing.\n\n\n* 3 - Cleaning supplies to kill it. Bleach is the best thing to use against it, but as mentioned before, \"benzalkonium chloride\", it also goes by \" Didecyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride\" can kill it, and so can hydrogen peroxide.\nIf you need to clean up after someone who was sick, wear gloves, something to cover your eyes like glasses, goggles, or even a shield, and a mask, and use these items. Clean everywhere, even in places you think it wouldn't be, because it can spread far if someone vomited within the vicinity.\nAlso as u/goldfish-bish states below, temperatures above 145F will kill it as well. [Here's a great article they listed that goes into further detail about how heat kills the virus.](https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/norovirus/home.html#:~:text=Remove%20all%20visible%20contamination%20with,to%20completely%20inactivate%20the%20virus.)\n\n\n* 4 - Stay on track with your health. I know this is very hard on us all, and it can be hard to keep up with yourself when things are bad, but keep up your health by eating proper meals, taking vitamins, and exercise if possible. If your body is not getting proper nutrients, it can make your immune system weak, which can then make you more susceptible to catching anything, not just noro.\n\n\n* 5 - Grape Seed Extract. Grape Seed Extract has been proven to reduce the risk of norovirus by making the lining of your stomach resistant to the virus leeching onto it, and making you sick. This is not a foolproof method, but the last time my mom was in the hospital with noro, the doctors there told her to take this to prevent another infection. [You can read about it more here.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121108195701.htm)\n\n\n* 6 - If someone in your house gets it, they are only contagious *after* they start vomiting or have diarrhea. Try to avoid areas where they are if possible, and if you feel the need to leave, and have the means to, you can. There's no shame in going somewhere else for awhile.\n\n\n* 7 - Try to keep things in perspective. Yes this is spiking right now, but so far, this still isn't the worst spike we have ever had. Things may feel hopeless, but chances are actually very low of catching it. It's estimated that the average amount of times a person will contract noro in their entire lifetime is 5 times. So the chances in reality are very slim.\n\n[Here are some further tips on what to do straight from the CDC as well](https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html)\n\n\n\nI would also like to share some products that can help. I have personally used these in the past and can vouch for their efficacy.\nEverything listed here has been proven to kill noro. \n\n[X3 Hand Sanitizer Spray.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C51KSJNG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)\n\n[Lysol Laundry Sanitizer](https://www.amazon.com/Lysol-Sanitizer-Fragrance-bacteria-causing-eliminator/dp/B07XR3C87P/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nKM9Xtfgx09hcPIEwtHucCt8QpUMFzSMWTNQD8llKtPWkoPKbvhpi7eOT7a-4-FaVk7nqBqF4LsTcBz-Mb-7huaOxWNYIWiltKjvft0vZZPzRKN4i_8cCN7s61Vy45ZB9mcQC5gQmuy4TNj8zKzQBBPWM9-7iNXjSgOVA6kF9r-mnzIRj5pXUn5tNh5sr5zLNvlDtf91YYjbDVGF7kuTqf1AM_3_ZUd_rvnpwQifTsXxYopor-cv6LT5YGMrMR_pjrhYEn1Cp_RAhUo4w7ZsuSbeo-eThz2k1sFod0asBM0Fb9Ola43_yn7C2HyVHeKuPWeWXUS0CbKt43qIO9jAomJXsvGUFEOo19IoAWm9SLCKRxUMuqlpOmZWTNshj074jD0vFLQD_wf-MsioOswjZtgG8O0s1Vs-3YFYmBJXy-l6HRtuxkg7Ez-DX6r-UiHR.RxQT4qX7ipVz8NDU2EoiKXhko80Awwk4Hoqp6TMoPm4&dib_tag=se&keywords=lysol+laundry+sanitizer&qid=1735573655&sr=8-5) Put 1-2 cap fulls of this in your laundry during the rinse cycle, and let it soak for 15 minutes.\n\n[Purell Multi Surface Sanitizer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075H837X5?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k2_1_4&amp=&crid=3HNF4PVRTIQM9&amp=&sprefix=pure) This is for use on hard surfaces like countertops, tables, and floors.\n\n[Tide Antibacterial Fabric Spray](https://www.amazon.com/Tide-Antibacterial-Fabric-Spray-Count/dp/B08N2BS9VY/ref=sr_1_6_pp?crid=E3Q7J11F8JTT&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.FCiDrIn8VTXupocMd5EDAAXDiNwyKyt9q9ruAdI_HgqdLLI93whe5j_mFLt3PImci1FRNrrzBW8O9XWPVawduRUs4qcKUrlna7dtK0oXEUs7iXUms3bTblU_jcZmKFgQB8zmH-hlxXNsvhrBuBClqbW71icdV08PP6u3KQvikDKacOIwMQnDEXmub37OkQFXo3qh65g09rtDBlDIU09LcmM8hKjVFKOziq6wUtzQnADAjkn060Xaouu7h412Hwdwv4DyGYVaIAzzA339Vm7QKVy60EWWsl1Dak-08I3B4nLOU9lGqL7Vdu6LZlLvQ4Nyc9h3G0KYb8oFtc0g6mWtSc70YtfTDzqqx-6uczo5JbGYo0RhyBeBylXlDhd9mTyaDEP9sskIVzFuEjOmInevEBnrQWyHAcskkr9vopmFORgRUHTGXE0GONJde9r_sDm4.SQW7UPqPnviusxIMT8_K06vMYeWQHahy9TQit50EwIE&dib_tag=se&keywords=fabric%2Bsanitizer&qid=1735573792&sprefix=fabrix%2Bcanitizer%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-6&th=1) This can be sprayed on fabrics such as pillows, blankets, stuffed toys, rugs, and carpets.\n\n[Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078MVPF95?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_6&amp=&crid=6R8KULF79B87&sprefix=clorox&th=1) These wipes are used in hospitals.\n\nOn a closing note, I would also like to say, if all of this stuff is making your phobia truly awful, and you are struggling to the point where day to day life has become a challenge, I highly recommend seeking out therapy if you have the means to do so.\n\nThis phobia is awful, and it's okay to need a helping hand.\n\nI know this may not be the most cohesive post ever, but hopefully this can help someone out in some way.\n\nWe're here for you all at this sub, and we will all get through this.\nI will be pinning this post, and update it as time goes on.",

I considered buying it the other day but didn’t feel like reading all the packaging to figure out if it did or not, and since Clorox / Lysol regular wipes don’t, mentally I categorized it along with that. So this is good to know for the future!\n\nNoro is killed at temps over 145, so my understanding is even if you don’t have laundry sanitizer, an alternative is washing at a high heat wash cycle and drying at a high heat as well. For things you can’t wash, steaming with a steamer at 170 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 min or 212 for 1 min will kill noro. https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/norovirus/home.html#:~:text=Remove%20all%20visible%20contamination%20with,to%20completely%20inactivate%20the%20virus.\n\nAlternatively, oxygen bleach detergents (like oxyclean) apparently also assist in sanitization - they are NOT BLEACH. My washing machine has an “oxy sanitize” setting which requires you to use an oxygen bleach product and then runs accordingly.

Their rules are that high chairs in the communal kitchen be disinfected with wipes (called V Wipes) after each use. I tend to put my baby in the same high chair but nonetheless, I wipe it down after each use, including the tray.\nI just found out that these wipes are not food safe! They contain around 10% ethanol and around 1% benzalkonium chloride plus whoever knows what else (possibly a fragrance of some kind). I can't find the full ingredients list on the company website.\nMy concern is that I never rinsed it or wiped it with water afterwards and my baby typically ate food straight off the tray. Meals are spaced 3 to 5 hours apart so the tray was always dry before she used it but I just did a lick test (I know that sounds nuts) 1 hour after wiping it with a wipe and it was so bitter!!! My baby has been injesting this and I feel so bad about it. I have also tasted it on her cheek when kissing her but couldn't figure out where it was coming from at the time. I would love some words of support right about now as I'm really feeling terrible...\n\n\n\n",

When staff complained about skin damage, they were told to just make sure the mask is fully dry before wearing it. But it's stupid because it DOESN'T EVAPORATE and it's a known irritant.\n\nSadly BC and other chemicals in its class called quats have largely replaced safer and often *more effective* surface disinfectants like chlorine bleach in hospitals, even for surfaces where bleach has 0 potential to cause damage.\n\nAnyway, OP you can just wipe the surface with a wet tissue or two before use, and that can remove most of the residue.",

    "body": "After 7 years of managing really bad Sinus infections, 3 surgeries, thousands of dollars of meds, I finally figured it out. \n\nThis certainly won't be the case for everyone but I felt I needed to share this in case it helps 1 other person so they don't have to go through what I did.\n\nI'm not a doc, and this is not medical advice. Just my anecdotal experience.\n\nTurns out I am allergic to the preservatives in the nose sprays the doctors have been giving me for years. BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE to be specific. \n\nThis is the preservative in Nasonex, Flomist, Iliadin, most generic mometasone sprays and even in some basic saline sprays. \n\nHow I found out was, I had an allergic reaction to taking 3, 500mg panados. \n\nPanado is 500mg Paracetamol and 0.12% m/m potassium sorbate as preservative. \n\nI thought for a while that I was allergic to paracetamol but I did blood tests which came out negative. And in my last surgery the doc's were giving me IV paracetamol with no issue. \n\nAdditionally, after my last sinus surgery, I stopped taking nose spray's for a month and my nose was perfect.\n\nThen I began the nose sprays again and all the symptoms came back. No taste, no smell, blocked nose lots of yellow/golden mucus. Absolute hell again.\n\nSo this led me to believe that the sprays were an issue and I connected it with the preservative sensitivity.\n\nThis led me down the path of allergies to preservatives and I came across a few interesting medical papers: \n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1987.tb00386.x#:\\~:text=Asthma%20and%20rhinitis%20are%20the,the%20most%20common%20causative%20agents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1398-9995.1987.tb00386.x#:~:text=Asthma%20and%20rhinitis%20are%20the,the%20most%20common%20causative%20agents)\n\nAsthma and rhinitis are the main hypersensitivity symptoms in the respiratory tract, and azo dyes, benzoic acid, and sulfitic food additives are the most common causative agents.\n\n——\n\n[https://karger.com/orl/article-pdf/47/5/278/3375821/000275784.pdf](https://karger.com/orl/article-pdf/47/5/278/3375821/000275784.pdf)\n\nAbstract. A 33-year-old woman with documented hypersensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and preservatives, causing bronchial asthma and rhinitis when ingested, was investigated because of ‘allergy to nose drops’. It was found that she had a serious local reaction caused by the preservative used in the nose drops prescribed. This reaction might occur more commonly than realized, since sensitivity towards ASA is fairly common in the general population.\n\n——\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10566570/#:\\~:text=Most%20decongestant%20sprays%20contain%20the,the%20symptoms%20of%20allergic%20rhinitis.\n\nMost decongestant sprays contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BKC), which causes toxic reactions in the nose, eyes, ears, and lungs, and may exacerbate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. \n\n——\n\n[https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(01)91127-8/pdf](https://www.resmedjournal.com/article/S0954-6111(01)91127-8/pdf)\n\nBenzalkonium chloride as a preservative in nasal solutions: re-examining the data\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI need to find a way to do blood tests to confirm the preservative allergy but from what I can tell, there is no conclusive way to test for preservative allergies:   \n[https://www.allergy-clinic.co.uk/allergies/food-allergy/food-additives/#:\\~:text=General%20rules%20for%20preservatives%20and%20additives%3A&text=The%20reactions%20are%20not%20IgE,results%20with%20false%20negative%20results](https://www.allergy-clinic.co.uk/allergies/food-allergy/food-additives/#:~:text=General%20rules%20for%20preservatives%20and%20additives%3A&text=The%20reactions%20are%20not%20IgE,results%20with%20false%20negative%20results).  \n\n\n\"General rules for preservatives and additives:The reactions are not IgE mediated and can be immediate or delayed for a few hours. **No accurate diagnostic tests are yet available** and even CAST testing (Cellular Allergen Stimulation Testing) produces variable results with false negative results.2 J\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, long story short, I stopped using nose spray's altogether and my nose is 100% again. Still on the antihistamines and neti pot once a day.  \n\n\nGood luck out there guys.",

    "body": "Hi there! I've had a problem with chronic chapped/peeling lips for years. My dermatologists are stumped, so I'll provide all the detail I can. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!  \n\n[Link to images](https://imgur.com/a/SehFhDS)\nFirst two images are how they normally look; third is shortly after peeling off the skin (indoor lighting), last is the results of the punch biopsy. \n\n**Symptoms**: my bottom lip is very chapped and peeling, and it's been this way for about ten years. The dead skin tends to come off in big sheets, about every other day. It's painful and cracks and bleeds frequently, like when I'm flossing my back teeth or trying to bite into an apple. The problem stops on the outside of my lip and does not continue into my mouth. Sometimes my upper lip in the middle also has this issue. I have no other skin problems. \n\n**Me**: F, 29, Caucasian, good health, normal weight. Healthy diet - lots of vegetables, mainly cook for myself, regular exercise. Desk job, don't spend too much time in the sun. For environmental factors, I live in the northeast US and have a cat (but have not had one for the entire 10 years of this problem). No family history of skin issues. For allergies, I have mild reactions to medical tape and bandaids (rash), grilled eggplant (burning/blisters in my mouth), and apparently a contact reaction to thimerosol and benzalkonium chloride (see below). I do not lick my lips or chew on them in any way (really!) and don't play any mouth instruments, suck on pens, etc. \n\n**What I've tried so far**: pretty much every lip balm, including plain Vaseline and Dr. Dan's CortiBalm (1% hydrocortisone, per my primary care doc), as well as Aquaphor, lanolin, lotion with urea, Psoriasin (coal tar 1.25%), Nystatin topical powder (per my primary care doc, in case it was a fungal infection). Some toothpastes can be painful when my lips are cracked, so I have switched to Biotene Gentle Mint with flouride, and about a year ago added Flouridex Daily Defense Clean Mint (per my dentist), and these do not bother me at all. \n\n**What has worked**: Aquaphor makes it slightly better, if I'm really vigilant about applying it. I have recently started using straws since I drink a lot of water, and using a straw keeps me from having to reapply Aquaphor all day long. Aquaphor or sometimes lanolin are the only things I apply (no lipsticks or other balms).  \n\n**Test results**: \n*North American standard patch test, per my dermatologist: only reactions were for thimerosal and a minor reaction for benzalkonium chloride. I have checked all products that come in contact with my face or mouth, and none contain these ingredients. \n*Lip punch biopsy by dermatologist: \"Hyperkeratosis and acanthosis consistent with chronic external trauma/irritation. Underlying eczema or contact dermatitis is also possible.\" See last image in album, but it basically just says this. My dermatologist says this result doesn't give us much information. \n\nThis has been a decade-long problem that I only recently sought treatment for. I always felt like it was a minor issue, but it's quite an eyesore and can be very painful. I am being seen at a fairly large medical center, but my dermatologist, her two residents, and the other dermatologist she consulted with have no idea what's causing the issue. They feel it is likely not due to something I'm eating, because the inside of my mouth is fine. They suggested I do more patch testing or go see an oral specialist. Before I set up yet another appointment, I would really appreciate any input this community may have. \n\n**Thank you!** \n\n\n\n",

Avoiding Dry Conditions:** Protecting the eyes from wind, smoke, and air conditioning by wearing wraparound sunglasses when outdoors and avoiding direct air blowing on your eyes when indoors can reduce tear evaporation. The main place many people purchase those (not inexpensive unfortunately)[ is Ziena.](https://www.zienaeyewear.com/) The inexpensive option but not as good at blocking is buying wraparound sunglasses at any drugstore or search Amazon.com for a similar option to wraparounds.\n\n**8. Dietary Changes:** The main goal is to decrease eating foods that cause inflammation and Increasing your intake of omega-3 fatty acids through diet (e.g., eating more fish). Of course there are supplements that may improve the eye's oil film produced by the Meibomian glands, enhancing tear quality. That said when it comes to supplements there are differing opinions not surprisingly.\n\nIf you want one prominent eye doctor’s opinion on diet and supplements that is not really only all about diet issues since it has 40 pages on treatment items he reviews read this book (digital at $8.99):\n\n**Toyos Dry Eye Diet: What to Eat to Heal your Dry Eyes**\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Toyos-Dry-Eye-Diet-Treatment-ebook/dp/B0C1TBGD3R](https://www.amazon.com/Toyos-Dry-Eye-Diet-Treatment-ebook/dp/B0C1TBGD3R)\n\nThen see this study that showed Omega 3s did not work for those with moderate to severe DED:\n\n[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/omega-3s-fish-oil-supplements-no-better-placebo-dry-eye](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/omega-3s-fish-oil-supplements-no-better-placebo-dry-eye)\n\nThen, another person on Reddit, who seems very knowledgeable to me, wrote the following about that above study:\n\n*“Big faults in that recent study. I wouldn’t pay attention to it. The study’s main outcome was not about dry eye. The analysis was post-hoc, and the outcome measure was does X amount of omega 3 prevent dry eye? That’s not how we implement dry eye treatment. High quality omega 3s work for dry eye, but the type is critical. EPA and DHA in a 3:1 ration and GLA to enhance. HydroEye brand and Nordic Naturals Complete Omega contain the proper types and ratios.”*\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/HydroEye-Softgels-Dry-Relief-Count/dp/B003UNOY7Y](https://www.amazon.com/HydroEye-Softgels-Dry-Relief-Count/dp/B003UNOY7Y)\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Naturals-Complete-Supports-Cognition/dp/B002CQU55U?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Naturals-Complete-Supports-Cognition/dp/B002CQU55U?th=1)\n\nI also read in Dr. Maskin’s new book that he thinks HydroEye is the right combination and if you think it is helping then continue it…if not then stop it.\n\nLastly, I read on Dr. Jaccoma’s blog that he recommends MaxiTears Dry Eye Formula (which does have the GLA in it) see here for that formula:\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/MedOp-MaxiTears%C2%AE-Dry-Formula-softgels/dp/B004S412F6](https://www.amazon.com/MedOp-MaxiTears%C2%AE-Dry-Formula-softgels/dp/B004S412F6)\n\nBottom line? Differing opinions on Omega 3 supplements.\n\n**9. Proper Hydration:** Staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help maintain sufficient moisture levels in the eyes. Nobody disagrees on this one!\n\n**10. Manuka Honey:** Manuka honey contains anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant compounds that may nourish the ocular surface and reduce inflammation. Several studies have found Manuka honey eye drops can improve signs and symptoms of dry eye, including eye redness, irritation, and tear production.\n\nManuka honey is created by bees making honey in Australia and New Zealand from the Manuka tree as it is commonly known in those countries. Now, just to be sure everyone who is reading this needs to know do not even think about making your own drops, gel or cream from honey you buy at the store. Why? Food grade honey is not sterile enough to be putting into your eyes. You are giving all kinds of nasty things a super highway into your body if you do. Your stomach has acids to kill things with food grade honey. Your eyes do not so they need medical grade honey. End of story.\n\nTo get a deep dive into this approach see this article:\n\n[Manuka Honey Drops, Gel and Cream…An Introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/192pwg7/manuka_honey_drops_gel_and_creaman_introduction/)\n\n**11. Nocturnal Lagophthalmos:** A medical way to say one sleeps with their eyes open or partially open. One way you will know if you do this is to ask someone who sees you sleeping if they see your eyes open partially or completely. The other way is to video yourself while you sleep to find out. This is a big issue to solve as it has a major impact on DED. The most common solutions are:\n\n1. Purchase some [goggles like from EyeEco.](https://eyeeco.com/products/Rest%20&%20Sleep)\n2. Purchase something that will tape down your eyelids [like medical tape](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Kind-Removal-Silicone-Tape/dp/B00APHQ840) or something much more expensive like [SleepTite SleepRite.](https://www.eyesleeptite.com/#whatisit)\n3. Use the plastic wrap (any brand) method some use. Now it does have some possible downsides so consider that.\n\n**12. Bloodshot Eyes:** We probably need to have a word on this issue. There is no question if you have a situation of bloodshot eyes it does not look good. The question then becomes what, if anything, to do about it? If you are working the treatments above, hopefully the bloodshot eyes will go away. Now I am no expert so I asked ChatGPT 4.0 the following questions:\n\n**What are the problems with using eye drops for bloodshot eyes?**\n\nChatGPT Answers:\n\nUsing eye drops for bloodshot eyes, especially those labeled as \"redness relievers\" or \"decongestant eye drops,\" can provide temporary relief by constricting the blood vessels in the eye, thereby reducing redness. However, there are several potential problems and side effects associated with their use, particularly with long-term or frequent use:\n\n1. Rebound Redness: One of the most common issues with the prolonged use of decongestant eye drops is rebound hyperemia, where the redness returns worse than before once the effects of the eye drops wear off. This can create a cycle where the user feels the need to apply the drops more frequently, exacerbating the problem.\n2. Dependency: Regular use of decongestant eye drops can lead to a kind of dependency where the eyes become red and irritated unless the drops are applied. This is related to the rebound effect and can lead to overuse.\n3. Masking Underlying Conditions: Using eye drops to reduce redness can mask underlying conditions that require medical attention, such as infection, inflammation, or dry eye disease. Ignoring these conditions can lead to worsening symptoms or complications.\n4. Side Effects: Some people may experience side effects from these eye drops, including irritation, burning, stinging, blurred vision, or headaches. In rare cases, more severe reactions can occur, especially with eye drops that contain preservatives like benzalkonium chloride (BAK).\n5. Tolerance: Over time, the eyes may become less responsive to the effects of the eye drops, requiring larger or more frequent doses to achieve the desired reduction in redness.\n6. Possible Damage to Ocular Surface: Frequent use of decongestant eye drops has been associated with damage to the ocular surface, affecting the health of the cornea and conjunctiva.\n\nTo avoid these problems, it's important to use these eye drops sparingly and only as directed. If you find yourself needing to use redness-reducing eye drops frequently, or if the redness persists, it's crucial to consult an eye care professional to identify and treat the underlying cause of the redness.\n\nFor chronic or recurrent red eyes, an eye care provider may recommend alternative treatments or interventions, such as lubricating eye drops for dry eyes, allergy eye drops for allergies, or prescription medications for specific eye conditions, rather than over-the-counter decongestant drops.\n\nThen I asked the following question:\n\n**What is the difference between Lumify and Visine in the treatment of bloodshot eyes?**\n\nChatGPT Answers:\n\nLumify and Visine are both over-the-counter eye drops used to reduce redness in the eyes, but they contain different active ingredients and work through different mechanisms:\n\nLumify (Brimonidine Tartrate)\n\nActive Ingredient: Brimonidine tartrate, which is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.\n\nMechanism of Action: It works by selectively constricting the veins in the eye, which reduces the appearance of redness without significantly affecting the arteries. This selective action helps to minimize the risk of rebound redness and tachyphylaxis (diminishing response to a drug with repeated use).\n\nUsage: Lumify is marketed for reducing redness in the eyes and can be used up to four times a day. It's known for its effectiveness in reducing redness with a lower risk of rebound hyperemia compared to non-selective redness relievers.\n\nSide Effects: Generally well-tolerated, potential side effects are mild and may include slight burning or irritation upon application.\n\nVisine (Tetrahydrozoline, Naphazoline, or Oxymetazoline)\n\nActive Ingredient: Depending on the specific product, Visine may contain tetrahydrozoline, naphazoline, or oxymetazoline, which are non-selective adrenergic agonists.\n\nMechanism of Action: These ingredients work by constricting both veins and arteries in the eye. This reduces the overall blood flow, thereby diminishing redness. However, the non-selective action increases the risk of rebound redness and tachyphylaxis with prolonged or frequent use.\n\nUsage: Visine products are used to relieve redness due to minor eye irritations. They are generally recommended for short-term use only, and overuse can lead to rebound redness, where the redness becomes worse than before treatment.\n\nSide Effects: Common side effects may include temporary burning, stinging, or discomfort upon application. With frequent use, there's a higher risk of rebound redness and potential worsening of eye health over time.\n\nKey Differences\n\nActive Ingredient and Mechanism: Lumify uses brimonidine tartrate to selectively target veins with less impact on arteries, whereas Visine uses agents like tetrahydrozoline that non-selectively constrict blood vessels.\n\nRebound Redness: Lumify is associated with a lower risk of rebound redness compared to Visine due to its selective mechanism of action.\n\nUsage and Effectiveness: Lumify is considered more advanced in terms of reducing redness without the common side effects associated with traditional decongestant eye drops like Visine.\n\nWhen choosing between Lumify and Visine, it's important to consider the frequency of use, potential side effects, and the risk of rebound redness. For occasional use to reduce redness, Visine may be sufficient. However, for those concerned about the side effects or who need to use redness-relief drops more frequently, Lumify may be a better option. Then know that as Dr. Toyos writes in his latest book: “Lumify is preserved with BAK, a chemical that, if used on a regularly, can be toxic to the Meibomian glands and ocular surface. Lumify is best used on special occasions and not regularly by a DED patient.”\n\nAlways read the label and consider consulting with an eye care professional to choose the most appropriate treatment for your needs.\n\nThus it looks like to me one has to pick between do not use anything for bloodshot eyes (probably the safest option), use the one with what appears to be the least chance for doing damage (Lumify) sparingly or use the one that appears to be the highest chance for doing damage (Visine) probably best if never.\n\n**Link to Part 3:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/1b44y0c/14\\_home\\_otc\\_treatments\\_for\\_mild\\_moderate\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MeibomianGlandIssues/comments/1b44y0c/14_home_otc_treatments_for_mild_moderate_and/)",

To add to it, midway through my cleaning, I ran out of disinfectant.\n\nThus, coming to my question: how does the efficacy of surfactants compare to a disinfectant like ethanol 70%/benzalkonium chloride/bleach spray when it comes to sanitizing bathroom surfaces (say, a 2log to 3log reduction)?   \nTo elaborate further, say if I used a sponge with dish soap to scrub down non-porous surfaces like plastic and porcelain, followed by either wiping them with damp paper towels or rinsing them with water, whilst minimizing cross-contamination to the best of my capabilities. Is that sufficiently germ-free, or did I achieve nothing by doing so? \n\nThank you in advance. ",

If the former: a good cleaning with dish soap is good enough, you're okay with that.\n\nIf the latter, I would be somewhat cautious, wash your hands after touching contaminated surfaces and supervise young children (who may touch the floor etc. and then put their hands in their mouths).

Before putting anywhere near my face I did patch test on my arm that was OK and patch test behind my ear that was OK. I recommend everyone do the same. Now for the review. I have followed the product review guide from sidebar.\n\n1) http://www.ebay.com/itm/RETINOIC-ACID-20-PEEL-BODY-SKIN-WHITENING-STRETCH-MARK-WHITEN-PIMPLE-SCARS-/200586863076?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2eb3e8a1e4\n\nThe only seller I've purchased form is  beautymadness_wholesale and it's the only one that I trust.\n\n2) This is a retinoic acid skin peel containing same active ingredient as tretinoin. It says 20% but that really means 0.020% similar to prescription strength tretinoin. For all skin types I would imagine but definitely effective for my combo skin.\n\n3) I found the product to be extremely effective. I am an experienced chemical peeler and I achieved some of the best peeling I've ever had with this. I usually do a Jessner's peel then follow with AT MOST 2 layers of this retinoic. Even though this peel causes zero discomfort, it is very strong. More than 2 layers will be too deep and could cause bad results. Trust me. The best method for using this peel is 1 layer, evenly applied, once a week. If I am looking for a deeper peel then I'll use the Jessner/retinoic combo. \n\n4) I've never experienced any adverse reactions. A few years ago I applied too many layers and the peel was far too deep resulting in uneven texture. As long as you don't make this mistake then the results will be good as they have been for me.\n\n5) I purchased it for all the benefits of retinoic acid and I've found that it effectively lightens dark spots, increases cell turnover rate to shed top layers of skin and leave behind healthy glowing skin, all the typical benefits from a chemical peel.\n\n6) use it every 2 or 3 weeks to achieve good results.\n\n7) I would buy it again for sure. Currently on my second bottle. They offer sample size for like 10$.\n\n8) Ingredients: Water, ethyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, propylene glycol, glycolic acid, retinoic acid. \n\nA search of PC ingredient dictionary shows all BEST ratings except for ethyl alcohol and  benzalkonium chloride. Alcohol is rated poor and benzalkonium chloride rated average. Many peels have alcohol and applying 1 or 2 layers once a week is fine. \n",

Just sharing an experiment and some ideas. \n\nI have been plagued by folliculitis for decades. tried many expensive prescription and over the counter cleansers and medications.\n\nIn the past week, I’ve been applying Palmolive Foaming Antibacterial Hand Wash (Lime & Mint) (from supermarket) to my scalp, face and body. Twice a day.\n\nSkin bumps are discharging and drying up, peeling off and leaving behind flat healthy skin. Trapped hairs and pseudo cyst like skin around hair follicles is shedding.\n\nPresumably my symptoms are related to chronic bacterial folliculitis, previously swabbed positive for staph aureus. Told I was likely colonised.\n\nUntil now I have tried a line up of benzoyl peroxide products, hibiclens, antibiotic prescription creams, steroidal creams and moisturisers.. as well as bleach baths. \n\nHow can a cheap antibacterial hand wash seem to help alot (and so far seems less irritating) versus the others? \n\nI already shower twice a day and swim in a chlorinated pool as well. \n\nNot a cure but it seems promising so far.\nAnyone have similar experiences or suggestions?\n\n\nAdditional: I’ve seen a few posts about dial antibacterial hand bar soap also been effective. Both brands Palmolive (Australia) and Dial (USA) antibacterial soap products have Benzalkonium Chloride, an antimicrobial agent that kills or inhibits the growth of bacteria",

Based on posts from multiple users on both of the Glaucoma boards, I’ve taken the initiative to research the common preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and I’ve learned through these users and my little bit of research that BAK can cause dry eye syndrome and trabecular meshwork degeneration. \n\nI’ve always been a believer that generally, better quality products and services are more expensive. I have taken Cosopt and I’ve recently started taking Cosopt PF, and I noticed that regular Cosopt costs around $80 where I am in Canada and Cosopt PF costs around $48 (not factoring insurance coverage for both). Regular Cosopt comes in an eye drop bottle whereas Cosopt PF comes in a much larger box with four sealed sheets containing 15 little squeezable tubes in each sheet. The effort seems to be greater to prepare and ship out Cosopt PF, so why would it be about 40% cheaper? I would like to believe that I’m using the better and cheaper Cosopt PF compared to regular Cosopt, but then why is Cosopt $80 and why wouldn’t everyone use the PF version if it’s cheaper and better? \n\nAm I missing something? Am I overthinking?",

    "body": "I've been clear of bumps for over 2 months now, so I thought I'd make a post here detailing how I got rid of my bumps and what worked for me! This subreddit was a huge help to me when I was scared and struggling, so hopefully this can help some people.\n\nFor 4 months I had over 60 bumps and tried lots of the different suggested methods. Through trial and error the best method I found for clearing bumps was a combination of **antibacterial soap,** an **electric skintag removal pen**, and **hydrogen peroxide**.\n\nI bathed with antibacterial soap every day to reduce the viral load on the surface of the skin and prevent spread. Specifically used Dial antibacterial gold soap bars, but any similar soap with the active ingredient **Benzalkonium Chloride** should serve the same purpose. Lather and wash using just your hands, do NOT scrub or exfoliate! I made the mistake once of trying to scrub away with a washcloth and it caused a huge breakout spread. You just want to wash the surface of your skin without causing scratches that would allow the virus to proliferate. Pat dry with a CLEAN towel every time.\n\nIf you need to remove hair to get a better look at the area, use an electric trimmer. You just need the hair short enough that you can see what's going on underneath. Do NOT shave with a razor! This is too rough on the skin and will spread bumps.\n\nTo treat active bumps, I used a cheap electric skin tag removal zapper pen. I got mine for approx. $30 on amazon. They're kind of daunting to use at first but really it hardly hurts, just feels like a pinch. I never had to go above the lowest setting on the pen. Just focus the needle to the center of the bump and zap each one about 1-4 times depending on the size of the bump. Not too much, you don't want to cause scarring. The goal is to irritate the bump so your immune system will recognize it and work to clear it out. \n\nFinally after you've zapped all the bumps, use q-tips to apply hydrogen peroxide to each lesion. This will sanitize the area and help clear out the gunk inside the bumps. Let the area dry out after this. Larger bumps will weep out pus so cover them with a breathable bandage or gauze. With successful treatment, the lesions will scab up and heal nicely! Out of all the methods I tried, this one left the least amount of scarring. Leave the area to heal and wait a week in between rounds of zapping. Continue to wash the area with antibacterial soap every day. \n\n As an aside, here are the things that did **NOT** work for me personally (though some others have found success with them so take that as you will):\n\n**ACV** \\- sorta helped, but too much of a messy hassle to let it soak on the bumps. It also irritated the healthy surrounding skin. \n\n**CompoundW**\\- aka salicylic acid wart remover liquid. this stuff scarred me bad! I was left with dark spots where the bumps used to be\n\n**Cryo**\\- too harsh, irritated surrounding skin, and scarred\n\n**Manual Extraction**\\- I tried excision of the core using a needle and pimple popping tool, but it was too painful and bloody for me\n\n  \nThat's all I've got! Hope this may be of use and good luck to y'all in beating this",

Any medical treatment for animals comes with inherent risk and this is no different. Chytrid is very contagious and fatal, so ADF owners may find it worth it.**\n\n**Warning 2: the following post contains descriptions of frog illness and death.**\n\nAs most of you already know, Chytridiomycosis is a devastating fungal disease affecting amphibians worldwide. It is very contagious and typically fatal. It usually does not respond to typical fungal treatments. Researching on the internet, you will find plenty of ADF owners who have had this disease kill their frogs and treatment has been hopeless. There are a few scholarly articles describing varying rates of success with some antifungals and antiseptics, with varying rates of mortality as a result of the disease or the drug itself. \n\nOne of the more promising treatments involves benzalkonium chloride. JBot posted several versions of an ADF quarantine. One of the products, a foot fungus spray, is no longer available. The other uses benzalkonium chloride baths. Benzalkonium chloride is difficult to get, and usually comes in laughably large quantities. \n\nHowever, you can find benzalkonium chloride wipes fairly easily. I was able to get a box of 20 for $3 on Amazon. \n\nSo on to my story and protocol. \n\nI had two male ADFs for a while, happy and healthy. After some tank rearrangements, I decided to add two more. The female I added started spending a lot of time at the top of the tank. Then the others did. Then I noticed their skin looked thick and wrinkled, and one was shedding in pieces. I started treating with Maracyn Oxy. This did not help. One of my older frogs ended up with fogged eyes, ragged skin, and incompetent swimming patterns. It was clear he was beyond hope, so I euthanized him with lidocaine. The female frog disappeared entirely. I then got a massive nitrite spike. I had to pretty much tear apart the scape to get to the frog den at the bottom, where I found her corpse. I then cleaned the den and rocks etc from their other favorite hiding spaces. I had to perform multiple 75% water changes and added Microbe Lift Special Blend and Nite Out II. \n\nI had ordered some benzalkonium wipes, so I started giving the remaining two frogs a 20 minute bath in 500ml of tank water with two wipes, unfolded and swished around and left in for the treatment. After bath one, both frogs started to shed. Still in tatters but at least they were shedding at all. They were better able to swim; before treatment, they struggled, I assume because their skin was restricting. Two days later they got bath two. After this time, their skin looked healthy and normal, appetite was good, they were no longer coming to the surface to breathe abnormally often or long. Another two days I gave them another two baths for good measure, even though they seemed 100% back to normal. During each bath, I vacuumed the tank, cleaned the glass, and did a 50% water change. I also added Special Blend, Nite Out, and Maracyn Oxy. \n\nChytrid is mostly passed frog to frog but can certainly be passed through surfaces and the water column. The safer bet in this case would have been to do the baths with the frogs in a hospital tank, and to fully nuke, reset, and recycle their tank. That just wasn’t feasible to me given my tank setup. The Maracyn Oxy was in hopes that any of the fungus not on a frog might be susceptible to it, but this is just a guess and may be a waste of money. \n\nIn conclusion, I was able to cure Chytrid in two ADFs by bathing on alternate days for two baths longer than when symptoms had abated, with two benzalkonium chloride wipes in a 500ml tank water bath. \n\nI hope this information can help someone else. I’m going to wait two more months to confirm they don’t contract it again from the habitat, then am going to get more frogs, putting them in a QT tank and doing a week of baths and three weeks of observation before adding them to the frog tank.",

I have an L-shaped stud in there at the moment.\nCleaning: they gave me Cetaphil soap to use once a day, and these one-time-use swabs that have benzalkonium chloride on them (I think that's a saline solution?). If blood and crustiness build up throughout the day he advised cleaning up with a q-tip and warm water as these aftercare methods are only meant to be used once a day.\n\nMostly I'm seeing that q-tips aren't recommended (the saline swab is also a q-tip) because the fibers can tear off and irritate the piercing, that soap is not usually recommended at all and saline soaks (??) seem to be the go-to after care, which was not mentioned to me at all.\n\nIs what they recommended bad? If so are there good sources for this? Bottom line I want every thing to heal without a hitch!\n\n\nI should mention the salon itself seemed fine, everything was pre-packaged and/or sterilized, but I didn't have much choice in location as I live in a pretty sparsely populated part of Canada. I had to drive 1h45 to get to this place, the next closest would have been 3 hours drive.\n\nEdit: thanks for everyone's advice! I'm going to discontinue using what they gave me and use a saline solution from the pharmacy instead.  \n\nAlso I think my calling it a \"salon\" might have confused some people, it's a proper tattoo and piercing studio but my first language is French and \"salon\" is often used interchangeably - don't worry, I didn't get pierced in a beauty salon!",

They pierce with “instruments” (never called “guns” apparently) My boss kinda made me take the training. I was admittedly very apprehensive at first cause I know that going to a licensed piercer is the way to go but alas. So I took the training and what not, and at the end of the seminar, they needed “practice models.” I volunteered because I figured “it can’t be THAT bad and it’s free, so why not?” So I got my lobe and cartilage pierced. At first I wasn’t super worried. It didn’t hurt that much and it seemed like they genuinely knew what they were talking about. \n\nHowever, today I woke up and my piercing hurts. Granted, I got it pierced like two days ago, so yeah, it’s going to hurt, but I have a tendency to get anxious about infection and such. I started googling cleaners and tips for helping a cartilage heal and safe to say, it freaked me out. The cleanser they sent me home with is Benzalkonium Chloride which is apparently not great for piercings? And they also said to twist my piercing when cleaning to help the “tunnel” heal properly but that’s also a no go? On top of that, I read that piercing “guns” can shatter your cartilage!? I’m just nervous that I totally screwed up my ear and I’m wondering if I should go to a real piercer to get it fixed, if they even can.

Look for something advertised as being extra moisturizing, ie, for dry / frizzy hair. \n\nThe ph is neutral or low.

Thanks so much in advance!! - went to a diff derm yesterday and she told me to stop using aquaphor only put a little on at night and gave me this avocado facial oil to use every 15 minutes - she was saying that I’m giving the infection a great environment to grow in and I’m applying too much aquaphor. It’s been day two of doing that and my lips are a lot dryer and I can’t open my mouth more than half an inch , it’s hard to eat 🥴🫠 - I’m just gonna put faith that it’s gonna heal but if it gets worse by my next appointment and they still tell me there’s nothing I can do I think I might stop my treatment even tho I only have 5 months left because like what the freak and I just don’t think it’s good for my body if this keeps spreading  THANK YOU!

I have given him a paw bath since but I am extremely worried that residue from the cleaner could have gotten on his paws and he ingested it. Are dry surfaces safe or could the residue have gotten on his paws?\n\nUpdate: I called an emergency vet line, they said risk is very low with dried product but to watch for symptoms just in case. 2.5 hours later kitty is looking and acting fine but I'm staying up late to watch him for awhile longer. For anyone reading this in the future concerned about benzalkonium chloride, the vet said to look out for excessive salivation, vomiting, and skin/mouth irritation.",

I'm hoping to reduce the appearance of my SFs, reduce red patches around my face (between eyebrows, around nose, and rosey cheeks) and avoid getting (more?) fine lines. I've got freckles from when I was a kid, and I'm a bit over them, too. Wall of text incoming!\n\nMy skin, if left on its own, is quite flakey, and dry, but I end up with a flakey and oily nose (I figure it gets oily to compensate for being dry. I drink lots of water, and eat plenty of veggies. I'm very careful about sunscreen if I'm going outside for more than 10 minutes.   \n\nI think it would be worth using something more in terms of moisturiser - I'm just not sure what! I have macadamia oil, sweet almond oil, and Palmers Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E. I'm hoping to have children soon, so haven't researched retanols. I also have rosehip oil, which I understand is an occulsive, like the QV cream, so I haven't really been using it. I know there's not a lot of support for eye cream here, but if it isn't doing any harm, I'd rather use it up than throw it out.   \n\nFor the last year I've been using:  \n- Goat Moisturising Body Wash  \n*Aqua, Goat Milk, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Glycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Xanthin Gum, Parfum, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium sorbate, Citric acid*  \n- Ego QV \"Repair Dry Skin\"  \nNo full ingredient list for this one, Glycerol 10% w/w, light liquid paraffin 10% w/w, soft white paraffin 5% w/w and Methyl hydrobenzoate 0.2% w/w, dichlorobenzyl alcohol 0.1% w/w and Perfume free, lanolin free, propylene glycol free, pH6  \n- On occasion, Baji Face Mist (Rose, Kakadu Plum Face Mist, Antioxidant formula)\n*Purified water, vegetable glycerin, Aloe Vera leaf juice, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, decaglyceryl monolaurate, ethylhexylglycerin, grapefruit seed extract, kakadu plum fruit extract, quandong fruit extract, Vitamin B5, Billy Goat Plum flower essence, Banksia Robur flour essence, tocopherol (natural Vitamin E), Rose flower oil, vanilla fruit oil, alcohol, alpha bisabolol*  \n- Attitude Line Textured Eye Cream  \n*(Aqua) Demineralized Water\n    Ethylhexypalmitate\n    Dicapryl Carbonate\n    Cetyl Alcohol\n    Propylene Glycol/Glycerine\n    Glyceryl Stearate\n    PEG-40 Stearate\n    Phenoxyethanol\n    Simmondsia Chinensis Oil\n    Sorbitan Tristearate\n    Lanolin\n    Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil\n    Potassium Sorbate\n    Tocopheryl Acetate\n    Retinyl Palmitate\n    Bisabolol\n    Dimethyl MEA\n    Sea Salt (Maris Sal)\n    Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\n    Allantoin\n    Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate\n    Calcium Ascorbate\n    Litchi Chinensis Fruit Oil\n    Citrus Medica Limonum\n    Citrus Nobilis Peel Oil\n    Cucumis Stivus Fruit Extract\n    Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil\n    Boswellia Carterii Oil\n    Palmitoyl Oligopeptides\n    Rosa Canina Fruit Oil\n    N-Hydroxysuccinimide*\n\n- Olay Complete Defence daily UV Moisturising Lotion SPF 30+ UVA/UVB  \nAgain, no complete list for this one, but it includes *Octyl Methoxycinnamate 7.5%, Zink Oxide 5.88%, Octocrylene 2.5%, Octyl Salicylate 2.5%, DMDM Hydantonin 0.35%, Idopropynyl Butylcarbamate 0.013%*  \n- Neutrogena oil-free makeup remover (I wore makeup less than once a month, and could mostly remove it with the Goat cleanser and water)  \n*Cyclopentasiloxane, water, cyclohexasiloxane,  Aloe Barbadensis leaf juice, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride Dipropylene Glycol, poloxamer 182, allantonin, tripotassium EDTA, benzalkonium chloride, glycerin, cucumber fruit extrace, potassium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate.*  \n  \nall to no apparent ill effects (well, the sunscreen stings when it works its way into my eyes). 9 days ago I added in:  \n- Avene Cleanance K  (for AHAs and BHAs)  \n*Avene Aqua, Glycolic Acid, Cyclomethicone, Aqua, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin Polyacrylamide, Lactic Acid, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Propylene Glycol Ceteth-3 Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Cetyl Alcohol , Arachidyl Alcohol, Polyacrylate-13, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, Arachidyl Glucoside, Behenyl Alcohol, BHT, Bisabolol, Cucurbita Pepo (pumpkin) Seed Oil, Dimethicone, Disodium EDTA, Parfum, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Pyridoxine HCL, Sorbitan Isostearate, Zinc Gluconate*  \n- Suvana Organic PawPaw and Honey Balm  \n *Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cera Alba (Beeswax), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Theobroma Cocao (Cocoa Butter), Carica Papaya (Paw Paw) Extract, Mel (Honey), Buxus Chinensis (Jojoba) Oil, Vanila Planifolia (Vanilla Bean) Oil, Euphorbia Ceifera (Candililla) Wax, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Oil, Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni Extract, Tocpherol (Natural VItamin E).*  \n  \nCurrent routine is (PM only):  \n1.

Add that along with an increase in exposure through all the covid disinfectant and it just got all too much for my skin.\n\nI’m so pleased and hopeful my results come back but the dr seemed really confident that’s what it is. Now I get to go through all the products I own and ensure they don’t contain this ingredient.

    "body": "Mixing your own sea salt solution is no longer a suggested practice. Mixing your own sea salt solution will commonly result in the product being far too salty and strong, this can over dry the piercing and interfere with healing. \n\nYou are strongly encouraged to use a sterile saline, labeled for use as a wound wash. Your saline ingredients should list .09% sodium chloride as the only ingredient (sometimes purified water will be listed). \n\nAdditives like moisturizers and antibacterials should be avoided, as well as similar sounding products like contact lens saline, nasal spray, or eye drops.\n\n# **CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BODY PIERCINGS**\n\n**WASH** your hands thoroughly prior to cleaning or touching your piercing for any reason.\n\n**SPRAY** with sterile saline wound wash while healing. Moving or rotating jewelry is not necessary during cleaning/rinsing and may actually irritate the piercing.\n\n**DRY** with clean, disposable products like gauze or cotton swabs, gently removing any crusty debris or build up. Cloth towels should be avoided as they can harbor bacteria and snag on jewelry.\n\n# **Good Advice For Daily Life**\n\nWash your hands prior to touching the piercing; leave the piercing alone except when cleaning.\n\nDuring healing, do not twist, spin, or rotate your jewelry.\n\nExercise and sweating during healing is fine. Avoid activities that could jostle or aggravate the piercing. Keep the piercing protected from bacteria present on gym equipment or exercise mats.\n\nMake sure your bedding is washed and changed regularly. Wear clean, comfortable, breathable clothing that protects your piercing while you are sleeping.\n\nShowers tend to be safer than taking baths, as bathtubs can harbor bacteria. If you bathe in a tub, clean it well before each use and rinse off your piercing when you get out.\n\n# **Things To Avoid**\n\nAvoid cleaning with alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, antibacterial soaps, iodine, or any harsh products, as these can damage cells. Also avoid ointments as they prevent necessary air circulation.\n\nAvoid Bactine, pierced ear care solutions, and other products containing Benzalkonium Chloride (BZK). These can be irritating and are not intended for long-term wound care.\n\nAvoid over-cleaning. This can delay your healing and irritate your piercing.\n\nAvoid undue trauma such as friction and pressure from clothing, excessive motion of the area, playing with the jewelry, and vigorous cleaning. These activities can cause the formation of unsightly and uncomfortable scar tissue, migration, prolonged healing, and other complications.\n\nAvoid all oral contact, rough play, and contact with others’ bodily fluids on or near your piercing during healing.\n\nAvoiding things like excessive stress, drug use, excessive caffeine, nicotine and alcohol are suggested as they can prolong the healing process.\n\nAvoid submerging the piercing in bodies of water such as lakes, pools, oceans, hot tubs, etc. Or, protect your piercing using a waterproof transparent film dressing. These are available at most pharmacies and are ideal for nipple, navel, and surface piercing placements.\n\nAvoid all beauty and personal care products on or around the piercing including cosmetics, lotions, and sprays, etc.\n\nDon’t hang charms or any object from your jewelry until the piercing is fully healed. \n",

For the last 3 years or so, I have only been using regular shampoo and conditioner on my hair and nothing else, and my scalp folliculitis has been somewhat under control. Don't get me wrong, it's never 100% clear and I still have breakouts from time to time, but for the most part I was able to keep it from affecting my daily life.\n\nIn recent months I've noticed though, that it has started spreading. Especially on my face, back and chest, and it's very hard to get it under control there. I'm not sure what to do now, I even noticed one singular pustule on my forearm and I'm very concerned about it, even though it may be something else.\n\nI've tried using BP, but I'm extremely allergic to it and it makes my eyelids swell up. Pretty sure I'm allergic to salicylic acid as well.\n\nIs Dove Antibacterial soap (benzalkonium chloride 0.13%) worth a try for my back and chest? I've also heard some people using Head & Shoulders shampoo (zinc pyrithione) to get their scalp folliculitis under control, so could that be useful?\n\nThis condition has already started affecting my mental health and dating life, and as long as it was on my scalp it was still somewhat hidden, but now that it's spreading on my body I'm starting to get extremely insecure, especially in intimate situations. It has also hindered my sex life as I'm not sure if this is contagious and can be spread through sexual contact. Please someone point me in the right direction.",

    "body": "I've been dependant on oxymetazoline decongestants on and off since I was a teenager. I'd use it for a cold, keep using it for the rebound congestion, and eventually quit cold turkey, and after one night of poor sleep I'd be basically back to normal again, which I guess is why I never considered it a problem. I'd go years without using it, but every time I got sick I'd be on it for at least a few months. Since it was so easy for me to quit I never really cared about the dependence.\n\nI guess I probably should have, though. This time I can't quit. I tried a few times, and caved after the first week or so. I eventually managed to wean off a little bit by diluting the bottle with saline. That got me to the point where I was only congested in one nostril at a time, at which point I quit cold turkey for good because it was easier to fall asleep.\n\nBut it's been over a month and I haven't seen any improvement, and every night it gets harder and harder not to cave to the spray. Even with one nostril open, my nose whistles at night and I find myself less and less able to take my mind off the feeling of the other nostril being clogged. I don't use any saline containing benzalkonium chloride. I've tried all sorts of tricks for relieving congestion, including stuff like running up and down the stairs while holding my breath - nothing works for more than a few seconds.\n\nIt doesn't really bother me during the day. I've tested it by closing one nostril and trying to breathe through the other - there's always one that's closed, 24/7 - but I'm usually busy enough that I don't care about it. But at night, it gets really hard to take my mind off it.\n\nI've seen one or two posts suggesting that it could take up to 4 months for some people to see improvement, but the vast majority of information regarding rebound congestion says it's supposed to get better within a week. If there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I can do this. I can keep living with this as long as I know it's going to get better. Has it lasted this long for anyone else? Has it gotten better after a while?\n\nI am going to be seeing a doctor about this soon, but I need some encouragement to keep fighting this stupid congestion.",

Of course, I want to make sure I won't be damaging my hair in the process or ruining my curls, so I've been doing my research and looking around for my holy grail heat-protectant - one that can tolerate high-heat (around 425 F), has water-soluble silicones, no proteins, and no drying alcohols. I've already found a heat-protectant that I plan on trying soon (Discover Found Avocado Oil Heat Protectant Spray), however I'm still looking for a hydrating, heat-protectant leave-in conditioner to use prior to blow-drying. It's been a long search, and although I haven't found the perfect product I think I've come close enough with some of these. I'm open to some exceptions, such as using Amodimethicone because from my understanding it creates a thin film over the hair, doesn't build on top of itself, and mainly builds in damaged areas in the cuticle. Proteins are something I'd highly prefer to avoid as my hair seems to like getting as much moisture as it can get, but in really small quantities I may be fine. Also trying my best to avoid drying alcohols. So with all that in mind, I'd love to get some second-opinions on these products and which would be the best fit for what I'm looking for. I've left some notes on these, so I hope that won't confuse anyone lol. Any other product suggestions would be highly appreciated.

    "body": "So I’m hoping to be helpful and I keep poking around the microbiology subreddit looking at different studies. \n\nNozin nasal swab is just ethanol alcohol on a q tip with oils for nose comfort and prevent drying but they charge an arm and a leg for it on Amazon. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314006518\n\nThe study used what they call ethanol alcohol.  It’s not the same as isopropyl rubbing alcohol.  The product they specifically mention in the study is over the counter Nozin nasal sanitizer.  Which on Amazon costs about 34 usd for 10 ampules.  To expensive for regular use. *im trying to track down something regular to use that is more cost efficient*.  \n\n\n\nNozin Nasal Sanitizer contains the following ingredients:\n\n- **Active Ingredient:** Alcohol (62% antiseptic)\n- **Inactive Ingredients:** Jojoba, water, orange oil, lauric acid, benzalkonium chloride, and vitamin E\n\nThis combination provides a broad-spectrum antiseptic effect while also moisturizing the nasal vestibule.\n————————-\nThe hope of the study was to decolonize health care providers (nurses were more often colonized in the study) and they tested colonies for staph a. At the 4 hour mark and 8 hour mark.    Essentially using alcohol based nasal antiseptic reduced colonies in the nasal bulbs.  A peculiar side effect they noticed as by “mechanically “ sweeping “ around the placebo groups nose without antiseptic triggered colonies to grow.  So no nose picking or nose rubbing 😆\n\nConclusions\nThe results of our unique study demonstrate the effectiveness of single-day, alcohol-based nasal antiseptic treatment in reducing vestibular colonization by S aureus and other potentially pathogenic bacteria in HCPs. The HCPs selected for our study represent 1 of several populations within the health care environment, along with chronic-care patients and support staff, whose long-term presence contributes to the bacterial burden and associated risk of hospital-acquired infection in themselves and others. It is likely that a large, multicenter study will be necessary to establish the evidential basis for the effect of nasal antiseptic use in contributing to reduction of infection outcomes in health care settings. Given the multifaceted nature of the sources likely contributing to the overall bacterial burden and residual infection rates within most health care environments, such multicenter studies could be designed to address carriage by patients, HCPs, or both in combination. Data preliminary to larger-scale studies might be provided by investigations focused on currently nondecolonized patients and HCPs at facilities, perhaps long-term, where prevalence of staph infections are especially high. It may also be possible that data in support of the effectiveness of nonantibiotic nasal antiseptic use will result as a consequence of its adoption by proactive health care facilities, as was the case with the initial adoption of alcohol-based hand sanitizer use by HCPs.19 Within the patient population, incorporating the use of this antiseptic approach, in conjunction with the use of hand sanitizers and body wipes, may provide an important adjunct or alternative to preventive antibiotic therapy surrounding surgical and medical procedures. Further, because it will not contribute to bacterial resistance, the ethanol-based antiseptic provides a unique opportunity for regular daily use over prolonged periods by patients and staff in long-term care environments.",
