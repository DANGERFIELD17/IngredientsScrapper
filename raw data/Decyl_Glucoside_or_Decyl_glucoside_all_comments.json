    "body": "I’m 24 and I have sensitive/combo/acne prone skin. When I first met my dermatologist, he made me understand that I was doing too much and that I had a compromised skin barrier. He explained that a stinging sensation when you apply your moisturizer can be an indicator as well as random episodes of redness and breakouts. He also offered for me to go on birth control for my acne which I didn’t want to do. *(Scroll under my routine for my derm’s advice).*          \n            \nWent back in to see my dermatologist recently for a checkup and he was really impressed by my progress and said that my skin looked the best he’d seen it!!!        \n            \n           \n** My skincare routine:**        \n           \nAM:          \n1. Room temperature water rinse.      \n2. **Brandefy: Clinical Vit C + E + Ferulic Defend Serum** (dupe of skinceuticals).     \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics and probiotics).     \n4. **Innis free: Daily UV Defense Sunscreen spf 36** (no white cast, no pilling).      \n                 \nPM:           \n1. **The Ordinary: Glucoside Cleanser** (gentle surfactants).       \n2. **Dr Dennis Gross: Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel** (once a week).      \n3. **Murmure: Microflora cream** (prebiotics & probiotics).      \n4.  **A313: Vitamin A Pommade** (every other day / Retinyl Palmitate is a gentle retinoid).      \n       \n           \n**What my dermatologist advised me to do:**        \n        \n- Apply the Epiduo he prescribed 3 times a week and slowly work towards applying it every day (stopped after a couple weeks because my skin was peeling like crazy and felt like it was on fire).      \n       \n- Limit the exfoliating to max once a week (the skin already exfoliates itself naturally once a month).      \n       \n- Switch out my cleanser for a more gentle one like the Vanicream gentle cleanser or the Ordinary glucoside cleanser. And experiment with cleansing your face only in the evening.       \n       \n           \n**Having struggled for a while with my skin and being a bit of a geek, I did a lot of research and want to share what I learned:**       \n       \n- Retinoids thicken the dermis but they thin out the stratum corneum (where the skin microbiome lives)         \n        \n- The quality of the diet is very important because gut health has a huge impact on your skin’s health.      \n       \n- Non-ionic surfactants are usually gentler (look for: Coco Glucoside, Decyl Glucoside, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside…).      \n        \n- Try topical prebiotics and probiotics to support your skin barrier (both are important to work).       \n       \n- Look out for potential photosensitizing, poreclogging and irritating ingredients (that’s a whole post in itself).",

    "body": "Edit: I’ve removed product recommendations due to concerns over brand affiliations. I’m not affiliated with any brand but I can see how some may feel negatively towards this, especially considering some of the history on the sub for brands to exploit the readers here. \n\nI may make a separate post later with recommendations as well as a bit of a discussion around it for people who are looking for recommendations. \n\n—-\n\nHi guys!\n\nYears ago I wrote[ the sidebar'd piece about dehydrated skin that I still get tagged in today](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/22c4tf/dehydrated_skin_and_the_moisture_barrier_an/). I wanted to update that with some more detailed information and knowledge on why it happens, what is happening, et cetra. Hopefully this can replace that guide, since I feel like it was a bit too broad. :)\n\n---\n\nDehydration is characterized by a lack of hydration in the cellular system and intercellular channels of the skin. It is not a skin type, but a skin condition. It does not discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin types, and is frequently aggravated by lifestyle and skincare choices. \n\nTo understand skin dehydration, you need to first understand the role of the natural moisturizing factors (NMF) in skin hydration. The NMF is an invisible lipid composition that sits on the top layer of the stratum corneum (SC) as well as interwoven in the top most layers of corneocytes (skin cells), making up a part in what is considered the \"acid mantle\" of the skin. The term NMF first appeared in 1959, but was not universally adopted immediately. It is hydrosoluable (able to dissolve in water) and hygroscopic (able to retain water), composed of about 40% free amino acids, 12% pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA), 12% lactates, 8.5% sugars/peptides/inorganic acids, 7% urea, 6% chloride, 5% sodium, and various small amounts of other materials. \n\nIt serves three major functions:\n\n1.  Protecting skin from damage\n2.  Encouraging desquamation (exfoliation of the upper most layer of corneocytes)\n3.  Controlling permeability of the SC\n\nThe NMFs are very effective natural humectants, drawing moisture to the skin from the atmosphere, even at humidity as low as 50%. \"Hydrated NMF forms ionic interacts with keratin fibers, reducing the intermolecular forces between the fibers and thus increasing the elasticity of the stratum corneum.\"² This keeps the skin healthy and supple in appearance. It also serves to prevent excessive water influx (see the third major function above), such as when your skin wrinkles from being in the bath or shower for too long, which causes the corneocytes to shrink. \n\nWhile it is often thought that the stratum corneum is \"dead\" tissue, it still requires water to function effectively. The NMF serves to provide for this, drawing and holding much of the water required. For example, enzymes that cause skin cells to exfoliate away naturally, by breaking the various bonds holding corneocytes together, need water to do their job effectively. \n\nReduction or stripping away of the NMF results in dry skin ([known as xerosis](https://imgur.com/vBOb07w)), scaling, flaking, as well as fissuring and cracking ([such as severely cracked and dry heels](https://imgur.com/C0F7BKK)). It can also result in what we refer to as \"dehydrated skin\" (though this is not a medical term).\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Dehydration Feels Like\n===========================\n\nDehydrated skin is one of the more difficult conditions to diagnose because it is frequently invisible. There are many \"tips\" online about how to diagnose dehydrated skin, such as pinching the back of your hand to see how quickly the skin snaps back into place. *It's important to keep in mind that this only serves to show if your body is dehydrated. Dehydrated skin usually has less to do about the hydration inside of your body and more to do with how we treat the skin topically or the atmosphere around us.* This is why someone with dehydrated skin can pinch the back of their hand and see their skin immediately pop back into place, yet feel horrible irritation on their skin when applying a simple moisturizer.  \n\n[The skin usually looks dry, scaly, or flaky](https://imgur.com/cLTwbTf), and feels \"tight\" (such as after using a harsh cleanser). When pulled very gently, [it can appear to crinkle](https://imgur.com/8RRFIfj) (not to be confused with crepey skin, such as the skin appearance around joints), and can even look like it has a very thin layer of skin sitting atop the upper most layer of skin. In some people, it feels itchy. It is usually most evident on the forehead or nose. It can also look lackluster, dull, and lack \"bounce\" and suppleness. In some, it can take the form of crinkly but very shiny skin, usually due to abuse of skin remodelers like AHAs or BHAs. \n\nBoth dry and oily skin types can be dehydrated - dry skin because it struggles to hold onto moisture and oily because sufferers frequently use harsh cleansers or astringents to gain relief. According to Milady's Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary, \"When oily skin becomes dehydrated, the surface layers of cells harden ... and block oil secretion. The result is an entrapment of the oils under the stratum corneum layer. This is particularly detrimental in the case of someone with acne because it also results in the entrapment of the infection.\"¹ \n\nDehydrated skin also typically responds more viciously to active ingredients, such as BHAs, AHAs, sulfur, retinoids, and vitamin C. It can also respond to completely benign ingredients, creating a burning sensation or the skin feeling flushed and hot.\n\n* * *\n\nCauses of Dehydration\n=====================\n\nThe most common culprits of dehydration of the skin is stripping cleansers, harsh soaps, and hot water, though a host of other causes can come into play for some people, including skin conditions that aggravate dry skin (again, while dehydrated skin is not the same as dry skin, dry skin is especially prone to dehydration) or create acne (which frequently causes people to \"overtreat\" the acne and strip their skin).\n\nSkin Conditions\n---------------\n\n*   Atopic dermatitis\n*   Irritant contact dermatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Cutaneous lymphoma\n\nEnvironmental\n-------------\n\n*   Seasonal changes\n*   Dry air (low humidity)\n*   Flowing air (especially wind)\n*   UV radiation (tanning beds, the sun)\n*   Overwashing\n*   Age\n*   Sunburn\n*   Cigarette smoking and smoke exposure\n*   Friction (including harsh scrubbing and mechanical exfoliation tools like the Clarisonic)\n\nHeredity Disorders\n------------------\n\n*   Ichthyosis vulgaris\n*   Netherton syndrome\n\nHormonal\n--------\n\n*   Hypothyroidism\n*   Estrogen deficiency\n\nTopical\n-------\n\n*   Alcohol/isopropyl alcohol/SD alcohol/denatured alcohol\n*   Drinking alcohol\n*   Essential oils\n*   Clay masks\n*   Sodium lauryl sulfate\n*   Bar soap\n*   Astringents (particularly alcohol-based astringents)\n*   Topical medications (e.g. retinoids)\n*   Excessive AHA or BHA use\n\n* * *\n\nCaring for Dehydrated Skin\n==========================\n\nThe most important thing when solving dehydrated skin is consideration of the products you use as well as your environment. This means paying special attention to the ingredients label when shopping, being cautious about what is applied to the skin, and what your home environment is like (and potentially limiting outside exposure to harsh wind and sun). \n\nSince everything starts with your cleanser, this means picking a creamier cleanser or one with lower amounts of surfactants. I've done a whole post on cleansers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), if you'd like to read about all the various types of cleansers and how they work. The long and short of it is look for either a wipe-off cleansers, such as Albolene; an oil cleanser that emulsifies (rinses clean) in water, such as my beloved Clinique Take the Day off Balm; a creamy cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Aquanil; or a gentle sudsing cleanser, such as Paula's Choice Hydralight or CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. Avoid washing with hot water, which reduces the size of the micelles (the molecules created from surfactants, which cluster together), allowing them to penetrate deeper into the skin and strip it further. You'll also want to completely avoid bar soaps (pH is too high), micellar water (can be much more irritating), makeup wipes (same as micellar water), and harsh cleansers that make your skin feel tight after cleansing. \n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate. \n\nMoisturizers are also a cornerstone in treating dehydrated skin. Humectants are especially important. Some humectants to look for:\n\n*   **Glycerin** - A well-established humectant, it is a clear, thick liquid that is usually sticky on it's own. It is derived from combining water and fat, usually vegetable oil. It is not typically irritating, but it can be to some people in high concentrations.\n*   **Hyaluronic Acid (HA)** - A component of glycosaminoglycan, it occurs naturally in the dermis of the skin and is thought to play a very important role in skin function. It is advertised frequently as holding up to \"1000\" times it's weight in water (citation needed). When applied, \"hyaluronic acid forms a viscoelastic film in a manner similar to the way it holds water in the intercellular matrix of dermal connective tissue.\"¹ It needs application regularly to be effective, frequently breaking down in skin 24-48 hours after application (note: this is not the case with HA injections). It is best applied to damp skin, straight out of the shower.\n*   **Urea** - While it is frequently considered more of a moisturizer or keratolytic (able to break down bonds on dead skin) ingredient, urea has humectant properties and can attract and hold moisture in the SC.\n\n* * *\n\nHealing Dehydrated Skin\n=======================\n\nArmed with the proper ingredients, skin can typically bounce back within about two weeks (14 days). Once healed, skin should be maintained with ingredients and products that are beneficial to the skin's health. \n\nWhile healing dehydrated skin, it is recommended to use the most bland routine possible and avoid trying new things and any active ingredients at all. _It should go without saying that to heal dehydrated skin, you must drop the products that are creating the problem in the first place._ If you must change out one or two products that you believe were causing your dehydration, do so slowly and one at a time, starting with any cleansers and then moving on to moisturizers. \n\nPetrolatum is helpful to some people as well, but can cause problems for others. This is possibly due to it's ability to diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin in some people, which interferes with recovery. Your mileage may vary. \n\nIt is also recommended to sleep with a humidifier if you are in a particularly dry climate. You want to shoot for somewhere between 40-60% indoor humidity, as this will prevent the humectants from drawing moisture from the deeper layers of the skin, which evaporates away.\n\n* * *\n\nSources\n=======\n\n1.

    "body": "About four years ago, I wrote the currently sidebar'd post, [\"Evaluating Your Current Routine\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1x1ubd/evaluating_your_current_routine_read_me_before/). In that, I recommended things to ask yourself and consider before buying new products or changing your routine entirely.\n\nI recently began blogging, but I wanted to bring these posts to Reddit as well for people who did not want to click out of the sub. \n\nLots of this is content that has been referenced over the years on this subreddit, as well as elsewhere. However, I understand the frustration for new users stumbling in, seeing product recommendations and terminology being thrown around, as well as an enormous sidebar. It's pretty anxiety-inducing. I also see a lot of people skipping from products to products, asking what to try next. \n\nMy goals with this series is to break down *what* goes into your cleansers and how it affects your skin so you are empowered to make better choices as well as understand some of the science that gets passed around.\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down your average, general cleansers as well as oil cleansers (or the oil-cleansing method aka OCM) and micellar cleansers. Let's dive right in!\n\n---\n\n**Introduction to Cleansers**\n\nCleansers work by dissolving or binding to things on the skin that aren't normally rinsed away by water, such as the waxes or oils produced by our skin.\n\nWithout getting too into the weeds, they are able to do this with surfactants  (or \"the thing that makes cleansers sudsy\"). The most common surfactants, and the ones you may have heard of are SLS and SLES (sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate). These ingredients work by binding to the lipids (oils such as jojoba oil or silicones like dimethicone) and then being whisked away by their water-loving properties. Once mixed with water, surfactant molecules cluster together into little spheres known as micelles. Some surfactants molecular size allows them to penetrate deeper into the skin (namely SLS), where they can bind to skin cells. As you can imagine, this is very irritating to skin, and is what causes the eventual drying that you may experience after using some products.\n\nSo by increasing the size of these molecules or adding additional ingredients, we get a gentler cleanser.\n\nIf you've hung out in any beauty circle, you've probably also heard chatter of pH - \"What is the pH of that cleanser? Have you tried the CosRx Low pH Cleanser?\". The pH value of a cleanser can have an impact on how harsh your cleanser is on your skin as well, and simply put, it's because the surface of your skin is naturally pretty acidic.\n\nGoing back to Chemistry class really quickly, you'll probably remember something called the \"pH Scale.\"\n\nThings on the left side of the scale (1-6) are considered acidic. Things on the right side (8-14) are considered basic or alkaline. And of course, there is what is considered neutral, or pH 7. Skin has a pH of around 5.5, but becomes more basic the further down into the dermis you go, reaching a pH of about 7. Why is this important, you may be asking? Well, if you think back to your high school Chemistry course, you may have remembered the good ol' baking soda and vinegar reaction. When this reaction -- called an acid-base reaction -- occurs, the baking soda and vinegar exchange atoms and form different compounds, namely water and carbon dioxide. This is because bases are compounds that generally want to donate atoms and acids are compounds that generally want to accept atoms.\n\nAs skin comes in contact with other ingredients, even water, the pH temporarily raises and other compounds are created. Fatty acids (read: acidic components) of the skin are removed.\n\nHealthy skin can usually re-balance itself within an hour or so. Some skin takes longer to do this, especially skin that is prone to irritation, such as skin with acne, rosacea, eczema, or psoriasis. This is why your boyfriend can cleanse his face with a Dial soap bar and have glowing skin an hour later, while you're busily slathering on layer after layer of moisturizer.\n\nUsing a cleanser that is closer to our skin's natural pH is the obvious solution to this problem, and most modern cleansers are formulated much better than those of the past.\n\nSo now you're probably asking yourself: *Well, how can I test the pH of the cleanser I would like to buy? And how do I know the surfactant isn't going to irritate my skin?*\n\nA general rule of thumb is to look for mild surfactants, such as decyl glucoside, or multiple surfactants, like decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, disodium cocoyl glutamate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, cocoyl methyl glucamide, sodium cocoyl isethionate, and lauryl lactyl lactate.\n\nYou should also look for moisturizers, like oils, ceramides, cholesterol, and humectants (water-binding ingredients such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, or squalane). Avoid saponified oils (please don't use Dr. Bronner's on your skin) and bar soap.\n\nNow I know you're asking: What about oil cleansers then?\n\n---\n\n**Oil Cleansers**\n\nWhat if I told you that your grandmother was ahead of the game?\n\nNearly all of us have seen a tub of Pond's Cold Cream hanging out in our grandmother's bathroom or on her vanity. You might've seen her dab some all over her skin and wipe away all of her makeup with a tissue. She may have sworn by it as the thing that kept her looking young, and she's not entirely wrong.\n\nI like to think of oil cleansers as being broken down into two types of cleansers -- wipe-off cleansers like your grandmother's Pond's, and emulsifying cleansers like the translucent oil cleansers that come in a pump or tub.\n\nThe former -- wipe-off cleansers -- are the most common mixtures in the cosmetics industry. They are usually simple mixtures of oil and water, and are high in water content, which makes them inexpensive.\n\nThey spread easily and often leave an oily or richly moisturized feeling behind. They're typically purchased by people with mature skin, but are a great alternative for people with dry skin.\n\nThe latter -- emulsifying cleansers -- are also mixtures of oil and water, but are higher in oil content, which makes them more expensive. They contain emulsifiers that bind well to water, which allows them to rinse away in water.\n\nThe benefit of these cleansers is there is no real \"sudsing\" action on the skin. Indeed many of them can actually feel \"moisturizing\" due to their ingredient makeup. They are also excellent for breaking down make-up and other waterproof things, such as mascara, due to the high oil content.\n\nWhen picking out an oil-cleanser, look for shortened ingredient lists. Don't be swayed by extracts or other frills that will wash away. The oil itself will be the biggest point of irritation (or not) for your skin, so don't be afraid of \"boring\" oils like mineral oil or petrolatum, which is one of the blandest, most non-reactive molecules around.\n\nJust one more to go...\n\n---\n\n**Micellar Cleansers**\n\nMicellar water is quite literally made up of micelles, or the molecular bunches of surfactants that group up, their water-loving butts faced outwards. These larger bunches of molecules, diluted in combinations of water and hydrating ingredients (such as glycerin), are the most mild of cleansers.\n\nThe percentage of surfactant to other ingredients is generally so low that micellar water does not need to be washed away. This allows the hydrating ingredients, such as glycerin, to stay on the skin after the debris has been removed.\n\nThis makes micellar water ideal for sensitive skin or prepping the skin for product application, when cleansing with a standard cleanser and water will be too drying.\n\n---\n\n**All Wrapped Up**\n\nSo what does this all mean? Here are some general skin cleanser guidelines to follow:\n\n* **Cleanse your skin at least once a day.** At the end of the day, your skin not only has a build-up of oils, but also debris and particulates in the air.\n* **Don't pile it on.** Your non-sudsing cleanser does not need to suds to work.\n* **Two-step cleanse for removing make-up.** Most make-up is waterproof and does not easily cleanse away. Use an oil cleanser to break down the make-up and remove it.\n* **Use cottons to remove cream cleansers like Pond's.** The friction will help to remove grime and dirt. Splash with water after to remove any leftover emulsifiers.\n* **Use cool water when cleansing.** Hot water can make surfactants penetrate deeper by reducing the size of the micelles, which is why your hot shower is more irritating and drying to your skin than the less-fun cooler shower.\n* **Moisturize.** Even water strips away the valuable fatty acids in your skin. Using a moisturizer on your skin after will help your skin to re-balance itself quicker.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Kind of Stephen](https://kindofstephen.com/)\n* [DermaScope](https://www.dermascope.com/ingredients/surfactants-and-emulsifiers)\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

I tested all products with the recommended 1.5-2.5 mL amount. (Full inci in links. [Tested products](http://imgur.com/a/6nT48) are mentioned in order of how good the ingredients and ss actives are. In the notes at the end of this post is the order of greasiness and explanation on my whitecast scale). High UVA protection ss is great, but don't forget the role of sunglasses, hats and uv protective clothing.\n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (the best in my opinion)**\n\n* [€39.95/50mL - Uncover Skincare Suncare SPF30/UVA22](https://www.dr-jetskeultee.com/products/skincare/protect/suncare-spf-30-face.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M.\n  * **Whitecast:** 1.5-2  \n  * **Rating:** 7.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This sunscreen uses Tinosorb S and M as the only sunscreen actives, which makes this a very good stable sunscreen, and combined with the non water reistant formula it gives theoretically a low risk of skin irritation and pore clogging. Relatively high uva/uvb ratio (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/1.18). Airless pump, preservative free, non greasy cream texture, slightly sticky, but relatively easy to apply the recommended amount. It is a thicker, more cream like consistency than the Uncover Suncover below. It's not completely matte, but better than Derma and Biodermal. The things I don't like: the slight whitecast and shine, and it could have been a little bit more hydrating.\n  * **Available at:** only online available via their own webshop for EU countries (no usa/canada)\n\n* [€11.30/50mL - MUTI BODY SPF50/UVA20](https://www.muticare.com/muti-sonnencreme)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** Thin runny texture with matte finish, which I guess many will like. You need to work it in well, otherwise you can get some streaks. Very good stable sunscreen actives. Airless pump, preservative free. Unfortunately very high concentration of propylene glycol (1,2 Propanediol), which can be irritating and sensitizing, especially if concentration is higher than 10%, but for sensitive skin already from 2%. So I'm only showing this sunscreen hoping the company will change the Propylene Glycol, because the sunscreen actives and the price are great. (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/2.51)\n\n* [€49/50mL - HighDroxy D Light Fluid SPF25/UVA15](https://www.highdroxy.de/produkt/highdroxy-d-light-fluid/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb A2B.\n  * **Whitecast:** 2.5 ([see this picture I found](https://konsumkaiser.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_2418-e1463422184478.jpg))\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:** comparable to the MUTI one, very thin lightweight texture, but this one uses Propanediol (1,3 Propanediol), although a very similar molecule, apparently studies indicate this is less irritating than Propylene Glycol because the OH groups are at the opposite ends of the molecule, whereas with Propylene Glycol the OH groups are much closer together (above 75% propanediol can be mildly irritating according the CIR safety study). A really great sunscreen with some antioxidants, and very good sunscreen actives, although quite expensive.\n\n* [€17.99/50mL - Biodermal Gevoelige Huid Face Cream SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/gevoelige-huid-zonnecreme-gezicht-spf-50/)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  Cream texture, no pilling. For sensitive and dry skin this is really a great option, I really think this is the best hydrating sunscreen from this entire list and although it contains Tinosorb M, it doesn't have visible whitecast. Although it contains mattifying Tapioca Starch, it is shiny. The \"Gevoelige Huid Spray SPF50\" has a comparable formula. The Sensitive Face SPF30, doesn't have any whitecast and contains great sunscreen actives, with the exception of the added Octocrylene.  Other [biodermal sunscreens](http://www.biodermal.nl/producten/#!/zon-huid/all/45) are fragranced, or contain Octocrylene/Avobenzone. The fragranced Biodermal Mattifying Zonfluide SPF50+ is just as greasy as the Gevoelige Huid Face SPF50+, although the name would suggest otherwise. Same products are sold in Sweden under the ACO brand and in Norway under Cliniderm and Cosmica. Good Aco products are for example: [ACO Sun Face Fluid ](http://www.yliopistonverkkoapteekki.fi/ACO-SUN-FACE-FLUID-MATTIFYING) and [ACO Kids Sun](http://www.aco.se/produkter/sun/spf-high/high-protection-sun-lotion-spf-50-big-size/). \n  * **Available at:** all drugstores in The Netherlands.\n\n* [€24/50mL - Oriflame Sun Zon UV Protector Face and Exposed Areas SPF50/UVA>16](https://nl.oriflame.com/products/product?code=23378)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150\n  * **Whitecast:** 1\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** The sunscreen actives and ingredients are comparable to the Biodermal Face SPF50. The body SPF50 version is also good. I think the Biodermal above applies a bit more evenly with less chance of streaks and clumps.\n\n* [€2.75/50mL - Derma Sollotion SPF30/UVA>10](http://www.derma.dk/sollotion-hoej-spf30.aspx?id=126)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Uvasorb HEB\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  applies easily, doesn't pill, very nice sunscreen actives, no irritants and no whitecast, unfortunately it isn't matte (dewy finish) and sometimes I have a feeling my skin doesn't agree with this sunscreen (redness and itching in neck after shaving). Levevis, [Avivir](http://www.aloevera.dk/page124.aspx?recordid124=55), [Rudolph Care Kids](https://www.rudolphcare.dk/en/products/kids-sun-lotion-spf-30) and [Änglamark](http://anglamark.dk/solcreme/) have similar formulas as Derma. \nThere's also a Face version [Derma Ansigtsolcreme SPF30](http://www.derma.dk/ansigtssolcreme-spf-30-hoej.aspx?id=145) packaged in an airless pump, which  absorbs faster and is a little bit less shiny (comparable to the non-profit Uncover Suncover). The face version contains [Tinosorb S Aqua](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/804/240238/Tinosorb-S-Aqua), this active provides a very good uva coverage. The SLES in the product is part of the Tinosorb S Aqua suspension, concentration is <0.07%, companies don't have to list it on the ingredient list since it's part of the standard suspension, so most companies won't list it (Same with Ultrasun not mentioning Decyl Glucoside and Propylene Glycol part of Tinosorb M). If Tinosorb S and Polymethyl Metacrylate are on the inci list, probably Tinosorb S Aqua has been used. There's also a [Derma Sollotion SPF50](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/81-derma-sonnenlotion-lsf-50-sehr-hoch-5709954015218.html) version, which doesn't have a whitecast and has a similar base as the face version, but it is thicker and more shiny. Some research indicates that aloe emodin from Aloe Vera can increase free radcial production under UV light, /u/pasqal20 has asked Derma: their Aloe is purified and don't contain (any significant amount of) antraquinones.\n\n* [€9.99/50mL - Änglamark Face SPF50/UVA>16 ](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/506-anglamark-sonnen-gesichtscreme-lsf-50-hoch-fur-kinder-und-erwachsene-50-ml-7340011470243.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Tinosorb S Aqua®\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  These Anglamark ss are identical to the Derma sunscreens, but don't contain Aloe Extract and Vitamin E (perhaps this is a better option for people with sensitive skin). Just like with Derma, there's also an [SPF30 Face](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/lippenschutz/504-anglamark-sonnen-gesichtscreme-lsf-30-hoch-fur-kinder-und-erwachsene-50-ml-7340011470236.html) version and a [SPF30 Lotion](https://www.neutrale-produkte.de/sonnenlotion/491-anglamark-sonnenlotion-lsf-30-hoch-fur-die-ganze-familie-7340011429265.html) body version. \n\n* [€11.13/50mL - Noreva Cicadiane Protect Crème Réparatrice Photo-Protectrice SPF 50+/UVA>20 ](https://www.cocooncenter.com/noreva-cicadiane-protect-creme-reparatrice-photo-protectrice-spf-50-40-ml/27319.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S Aqua®, Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150 \n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet, but ingredients are good. Looking at the sunscreen actives it is unlikely this sunscreen will leave a whitecast.\n\n* [€5.50/50mL - Louis Widmer Sun Gel SPF30/UVA>10](http://www.louis-widmer.nl/nl_NL/zon/sun-care/zonnebescherming/sun-gel-30/)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Polysilicone-15, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Uvasorb HEB.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:**  Shared by /u/ggabrielpp. Louis Widmer promises a non-greasy quickly absorbing sunscreen. In my opinion however it is extremely shiny and it doesn't absorb well either, it looks like an oily sheen on your skin. Ingredients and price are good.\n\n* [€1.75/50mL - Uncover Skincare Suncover SPF30/UVA12](https://www.dr-jetskeultee.com/products/suncover-suncream/suncover-spf30-1000ml.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Tinosorb S, Ensulizole\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 7.25/10\n  * **Explanation:**  no whitecast, contains Niacinamide (at 1%),  thin fluid gel like texture that spreads around easily ([see also for example this youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8eHbNWMRGs&t=10m20s)). Because it's so thin and spreads around so easily I find it a bit hard to apply the recommended amount, it takes a few seconds but then it absorbs quickly but not to a matte finish, more a dewy finish, preservative free, most affordable sunscreen in this list. (UVA/UVB ratio = 1/2.5)\n\n* [€9.77/50mL - Eubos Haut Ruhe Schutzcremegel SPF30/UVA>10](https://www.apo.com/eubos-kinder-haut-ruhe-sonnenschcrgel-lsf-30uva-50ml-pzn-10395821?utm_source=idealo&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Preisvergleich)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Tinosorb S.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Rating:** 5/10\n  * **Explanation:** Same sunscreen actives as Uncover Suncover, but this one doesn't contain fatty alcohols. Thicker gel-cream texture. Some people say it pills, but really this doesn't pill at all. I've tried very thick layers and applying it over other creams, but this doesn't pill at all. It is extremely sticky and extremely shiny however. If you blot your face, the shine can be eliminated very easily, but it is extremely sticky.\n\n* [Dermaviduals SPF50](http://www.dermaviduals.com/english/products/dermaviduals-special/sun-protection-cream-spf-50.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvasorb HEB, Ensulizole, Tinosorb S.\n\n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (with Avobenzone)**\n\n* [ €16/50mL- Avene Emulsion Fragrance Free SPF50+/UVA>20](https://www.dermatheek.nl/a-25365009/avene-van-a-tot-z/avene-spf-50-emulsie-zonder-parfum/#specs)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone.\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:**  very nice non greasy texture ([see also review by Gothamista](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54pmGJ3yYY&t=8m24s)), suitable for oily skin, the airless pump packaging is very convenient. I really like the texture of this sunscreen, but for me it leaves a very, very visible whitecast (therefore the low rating), and it contains avobenzone unfortunately. The same formula is sold under the Aderma brand. There's also a comparable [Avene SPF50+ creme](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/creme-spf-50) version, that's slightly more hydrating, and [Avene SPF50+ milk](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.be/nl_BE/zon/zonnebescherming/oranje-gamma-spf-50-30-20/melk-spf-50-voor-kinderen) that's more budget friendly with almost identical ingredients, but it is more greasy than the emulsion.\n\n* [€10.60/50mL - Avene Sunsimed SPF50+/UVA31.8](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-solaire-sunsimed-very-high-protection-80ml/29945.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:** This products feels quite similar to the Avene Emulsion in my opinion. Full ingredients are not mentioned on websites, those fall under Expicients, full inci: Tocopheryl Glucoside 50%, Laurate Glyceryl, Ethylhexyloxyphenol(bis) Metho., Dioctyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxy Dibenzoylmethane, MBBT (Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol), Decyl Glucoside Med., Adipate Diisopropyl, Benzoate C12-C15, Pentanoate(neo)Isodecyl, Isononanoate Cetostearyl, Cetyl Phosphate Potassium, Behenate(Di)Glyceryl/Behe.

It's a good sunscreen, the whitecast is less visible than the Avene Emulsion and probably many will like the thin texture. Airless pump. Negatives, it is quite expensive, still slightly shiny and a slight whitecast, contains avobenzone. \n\n* [€9.36/50mL - Uriage Bariesun Creme Fragrance Free SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.pharmaciefloritlafayette.com/uriage-bariesun-creme-sans-parfum-spf-50-50ml-p-1863888.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Uvinul T150\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  see above. This is basically a budget option of the Uriage Depiderm, so good sunscreen, nice texture, but it does have a slight whitecast and it contains avobenzone.\n\n* [€7.35/50mL - Daylong Extreme SPF50/UVA>16](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/daylong-extreme-liposomal-sun-milk-spf-50-100ml/27578.html)\n  * **Actives:** Octisalate, Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S, Uvasorb HEB, Avobenzone\n  * **Whitecast:** 3\n  * **Explanation:** According some blogs it contains 2.5% alcohol. It does have gpod ingredients amd a great uva protection. \n\n* [€28/50mL- Bioderma Photoderm Kids Spray SPF50+/UVA39](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/bioderma-photoderm-kid-spray-spf-50-200ml/14662.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Avobenzone, Uvinul T150\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  Considering the extremely high uva protection these Photoderm sunscreens apply surprisingly well, slight whitecast and shine, but not too bad. Does contain high concentration of avobenzone and some other variants also octocrylene, so perhaps not the best for sensitive skin.\n\n* [€16.33/50mL- La Roche Posay Anthelios Ultra Zonnecreme SPF50+](http://www.laroche-posay.nl/verzorgingsproducten/Anthelios/Anthelios-Zonnecr%C3%A8me-Ultra-SPF50-zonder-parfum-p24269.aspx)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Octisalate, Uvinul T150, Mexoryl XL, Avobenzone, Mexoryl SX.\n  * **Whitecast:** 0\n  * **Explanation:** Although this product does contain alcohol, this is the best sunscreen you can buy from La Roche Posay in my opinion at the moment. It's free from titanium dioxide, fragrance, homosalate, so an improvement from previous versions. It doesn't leave a whitecast, but it is shiny and sticky.\n\nAvene, Bioderma, Uriage and Musteala are available at https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/ and for most countries in Europe just in pharmacies. \n\n**Good organic sunscreen actives (with Titanium Dioxide)**\n\n* [€16.50/50mL - ACM Depiwhite M SPF50+](https://www.labo-acm.com/en/anti-spots/49-depiwhite-advanced-3760095251899.html)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Tinosorb S, UvinulT150, TinosorbM, Titanium Dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** \n  * **Rating:** \n  * **Explanation:** \n\n* [€8.99/50mL Kruidvat Solait Face Sensitive Sunfluid SPF50+/UVA>20](https://www.kruidvat.nl/kruidvat-solait-sensitive-spf50-face-fluid/p/4329991)\n * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Octisalate, Tinosorb S, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb A2B, Uvasorb HEB, Uvinul T150m, Ensulizole.\n * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n * **Review:** This product has a lot of sunscreen actives ([ingredients](https://imgur.com/a/gqH7FVS)), which can be good since it will give a good protection along all wavelengths, but in general it often means it increases the risk of skin reactions. The texture isn't very thin and doesn't spread very easily, I don't dislike that, it makes it easier to apply the recommended amount, it's not sticky and not very greasy. It isn't completely matte, although not too bad. From the same Sensitive Line there are also two 200mL lotion versions, an [SPF30 and SPF50+](https://www.kruidvat.nl/search?text=solait+sensitive&searchType=manual) they are considerably more shiny and sticky.\n\n* [€23/50mL - Ultrasun Face Tan Activator SPF30/PA+++](https://www.lookfantastic.com/ultrasun-tan-activator-for-face-spf30-50ml/11426025.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Uvinul T150, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Ethylhexyl Salicylate   \n  * **Whitecast:** 1\n  * **Rating:** 7/10\n  * **Explanation:** These newer Ultrasun products are free of emulsifiers, alumina, PEG and preservatives. Airless pump. Lightweight gel-cream texture, spreads easily, dries down quickly, but not to a matte finish like the package seems to claim, the ss can pill a bit and it's a bit sticky. The nano titanium dioxide is double coated (Eusolex T-Easy), it's the only form of nano titanium dioxide that is stable enough to be combined with Avobenzone and Dihydroxyacetone (according the supplier). Does have some amount of grape seed extract, vitamin C and E and Q10. This version contains  Dihydroxy Methylchromonyl Palmitate, an ingredient that stimulates melanin production, increasing skins natural UV defences (again according the supplier). Most of the Face Sensitive and Body Sensitive have identical ingredients, so definitely look at the Ultrasun website under these 2 lines. The [SPF30 Family](https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Ultrasun-Family-SPF-30/28273011) is a more budget friendly option, with identical ingredients to the other untinted Ultrasun sunscreens. Untinted SPF50 versions have a slightly more visible whitecast (2).\n\n* [€28/50mL- Ultrasun Face SPF50+/PA++++ Tinted Honey](https://www.amazon.de/Ultrasun-Face-Tinted-SPF50-Honey/dp/B01BKF2N8K)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb M, Uvinul T150, Titanium Dioxide (nano), Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus, Ethylhexyl Salicylate\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted dark/tinted very fair\n  * **Rating:** 6/10\n  * **Explanation:**  this Honey version is quite dark (self-tan color) and contains some glitters due to the mica (almost invisible), the Ivory has a very light color and may appear a bit white on skin. Dries relatively quickly, not very greasy, these tinted versions are more matte and have a different texture than the untinted versions (see above), they don't pill as quickly as the untinted versions, but for dryer skin types also not very hydrating. It feels like there's sand scraping on your skin in these ss. Good sunscreens if the color matches your skin tone, airless pumps, not too greasy, relatively good sunscreen actives, some antioxidants, no irritants.\n\n* [€8.63/50mL - Musteala Bebe-Enfant SPF50+/PPD25 ](https://www.viata.nl/algemeen-welzijn/op-reis/zonvakantie/mustela-bebeenfant-zon-spf50-waterproof-melk-100-ml-nl#.WYDpbIjyiUk)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Uvinul T150, Ensulizole, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  thin runny texture, slight whitecast, slightly shiny but less than Derma, preservative free and some avocado oil and vitamin E. It's a good sunscreen. Although it's fragrance free, I didn't really like the smell.\n\n* [€5.15/50mL - Bamse Sunscreens SPF50+/UVA>20](http://www.apotea.se/bamse-solkr%C3%A4m-spf-50-100-ml)\n  * **Actives:** Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide, Uvinul T150,Tinosorb S\n  * **Whitecast:** 2\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet.\n\n* [€19.95/50mL - Dado Sens Sonnen-Creme SPF50/UVA>16](http://www.dadosens.com/dadosens-de/produkte/sun/sonnen-creme-spf-50.html)\n  * **Actives:** Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** 1+\n  * **Explanation:**  Not tested yet.\n\n**Mineral only sunscreens - Zinc Oxide**\n\n* [€15/50mL Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF50](https://ca.iherb.com/pr/Cotz-Flawless-Complexion-Lightly-Tinted-SPF-50-2-5-oz-70-g/68139?gclid=CN-vsMaqptQCFde6GwodDvcPoA)\n  * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, invisible\n  * **Rating:** 6.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  contains tetra-c and vitamin e, slightly thicker consistency, a bit shiny on application, I don't think people with oily skin will like it. It doesn't cause any streaks or clumps, it's really the most invisible physical ss I've ever tried, easy to apply recommended amount. Even on lighter or darker skin tones than mine it's very invisible. I would have liked it to be slightly more hydrating, easier to rinse off and less shiny. And probably it has a low uva rating. I don't have the same problems as [HotandFlashy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-yL1Qvxg_U&t=12m49s) considering the shine, it isn't matte, but for normal to dry skin types quite oke.\n\n* [€31.7/50mL - Paula's Choice Resist Super-light Wrinkle Defense SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/sun-protection/_/Resist-Super-Light-Daily-Wrinkle-Defense-SPF-30)\n  * **Actives:** 13% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, darker than Coola/Neostrata, red undertone\n  * **Explanation:** slightly darker redder tint than Coola and Neostrata, this tint does look nicer on my skin, it's slightly darker than my skin tone, but it's not bad. It contains some very good actives like EGCG, resveratrol, Vitamin E, although concentrations are unknown. Goes on relatively easily, but takes more time to dry down than Neostrata and remains slightly sticky.  Does give a very matte finish, this sunscreen looks extremely nice, I even dare to say the best looking sunscreen I have ever tried. However for me it's very dehydrating, even with a thick moisturizer, therefore the low rating. After a few weeks of use I start seeing dry lines and irritates patches due to dryness.\n\n* [$36/60mL Drunk Elephant Umbra Tinte SPF30](https://www.drunkelephant.com/products/umbra-tinte-physical-daily-defense)\n * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide\n  * **Whitecast:** \n  * **Explanation:**  Unfortunately it's almost impossible to get it where I live, so not tested yet. It contains Titanium Dioxide as pigment.\n\n* [€9.30/60mL Thinksport Everyday Face SPF 30](https://www.iherb.com/pr/Think-Thinksport-EveryDay-Face-SPF-30-Naturally-Tinted-2-oz-59ml/72849?gclid=CjwKCAjwzYDMBRA1EiwAwCv6JglRyk9RqaQ7VPPwtJfjsC3sM2dk3pSllbOhkWrtp0R3CF-BwuRJIxoC2asQAvD_BwE)\n * **Actives:** 20% zinc oxide\n  * **Whitecast:** ?\n  * **Explanation:**  Does contain sensitizing Grapefruit extract and it is unknown if the particles are coated.\n\n**Mineral only sunscreens - Zinc Oxide+Titanium Dioxide**\n\n* [€9.40/50mL The Ordinary SPF30](https://eltamd.com/product/eltamd-uv-elementsbroad-spectrum-spf-44/)\n  * **Actives:** zinc oxide, titanium dioxide\n  * **Whitecast:** 3.5\n  * **Rating:** 4/10\n  * **Explanation:** very obvious whitecast, feels also very drying on skin, sets in pores and lines, didn't like it at all. Does contain some nice active ingredients and according Deciem coated particles with a medium particle size >200nm are used, so that's good.\n\n\n* [€15/50mL Elta MD UV Elements SPF44](https://eltamd.com/product/eltamd-uv-elementsbroad-spectrum-spf-44/)\n  * **Actives:** 10% zinc oxide (nano), 5.5% titanium dioxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted\n  * **Rating:** 6.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** sunscreen goes on easily, less streaks and clumps than the Neostrata one, and it has a matte finish. It does look very nice, but the tint is too dark for my skin, so in my neck and around my hair line there's a lot of color difference. Unfortunately it isn't very hydrating, although the bottle says its a hydrating sunscreen.  Otherwise really great sunscreen.\n\n* [€48/50ml - Neostrata sheer physical protection SPF50+/PA++++](https://www.neostrata.com/product/neostrata+sheer+physical+protection.do)\n  * **Actives:** 7% titanium dioxide (nano), 6% zinc oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, very fair\n  * **Rating:** 5.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** very thin runny texture, relatively easy to apply. It contains Vitamin E and Green Tea Extract. It has a nice tint, but it's slightly too light/greyish which causes it to set in pores and lines, it gives a nice matte/dewy finish. It isn't very hydrating, and unfortunately it gives some minimal streaks and clumps. It's a nice physical sunscreen, but cotz is more invisible, and Elta MD has a nicer finish.\n\n* [€38/50mL - Coola SPF30 Matte Tint ](https://coolasuncare.com/collections/sunscreen-face/products/mineral-face-spf-30-unscented-matte-finish-tint-sunscreen-lotion)\n  * **Actives:** 3.2%Titanium Dioxide (nano), 1.8% Zinc Oxide (nano). (lip and baby ss non-nano).\n  * **Whitecast:** tinted, yellow/brown\n  * **Rating:** 4.5/10\n  * **Explanation:**  In summer the color is a bit too yellow/greyish for darker skin tones. It has a mousse like silicony feel, that spreads very easily on your face. It gives a nice skin like look, although on it's own it isn't really hydrating. If you apply a tiny amount this is the nicest physical sunscreen I've ever seen, but if you apply the recommended 1/4 tsp amount it simply doesn't dry down/absorb and it keeps laying on top of skin in streaks and clumps, and it takes very long times before it really dries down. I also wonder if the UVA protection is high enough.\n\n* [€28.30/50mL - Paula's Choice Calm Dry SPF30/Skin Recovery SPF30](http://www.paulaschoice.com/skin-recovery-daily-moisturizing-lotion-spf-30/146.html?cgid=category-sun-protection#start=3)\n\n  * **Actives:** 3.8% Titanium Dioxide (nano), 3.12% Zinc Oxide (nano)\n  * **Whitecast:** 3.5\n  * **Rating:** 5.7/10\n  * **Explanation:** does leave a very, very noticeable whitecast, personally I really like the texture and feel of the product, not very matte but suitable for combination skin. But even with foundation this still gives a kind of purple/white tint to skin. If it would come in a tinted version this would be good physical sunscreen, considering the actives, texture and skin feel.\n\n* See for other sunscreens I tried (but wasn't really impressed about) the [excel-sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EM9cHmBt_e4O8L0tU76nCYVfnSMuNW_j).\n\n \n\n**Notes**\n\nPersonally I find the Derma, Suncover, Noreva and Änglamark and Biodermal good, they are transparent and contain great sunscreen actives, but they are a shiny and some contain some pore clogging ingredients. In theory the Uncover Suncare, HighDroxy and Avene Emulsion are very good since they mainly contain Tinosorb M and Tinosorb S, but I don't really like the slight whitecast of these sunscreens. Ultrasun, Kruidvat and Uriage are also quite good, no extreme whitecast, nor very shiny. But they are also not matte and still have a slight whitecast. Elta MD and Paula's Choice Resist give a nice matte tint to the face, they really look great, but low uva protection and not very hydrating. \nSo a lot of good stable fragrance free sunscreens, but all of them do have some disadvantages here or there.\n\n\n> **Sunscreen actives** were most important to me when selecting sunscreens. I tried to select sunscreens with the following actives. Important factors for a sunscreen active is it's stability, possibility of skin reactions and free radical formation and if it penetrates skin. Testings for endocrine disruption are mainly done in vitro, I think it's effect is negligible in real life. For EU sunscreens with unknown UVA level, I give 1/3 of the SPF level with a \">\" sign:\n\n\n> * **Tinosorb S** - Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine - BEMT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb M** - Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol - MBBT (UVB+UVA2+UVA1)\n\n> * **Tinosorb A2B** - Tris-biphenyl Triazine (UVB+UVA2)\n\n> * **Uvinul T150** -  Octyl Triazone/Ethylhexyl Triazone - EHT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvasorb HEB** - Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone  - Iscotrizinol - DBT (UVB)\n\n> * **Uvinal A Plus** - Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate - DHHB (UVA1+UVA2)\n\n> * **Mexoryl SX** - Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid - TDSA (UVA)\n\n> * **Mexoryl XL** - Drometrizole trisiloxane -DTS (UVB+UVA)\n\n> * **ZnO (coated)** - For US users in my opinion physical sunscreen actives are the best choice, all of the filters mentioned above are not allowed yet. I doubt there are many companies using true non-nano physical actives. The most common used patented physical actives used by the cosmetic industry have a median particle size under (nano) or just above 100 nm (non-nano). But with all these standard mixes, still a large part falls in the nano-range, and the stability of coatings and skin absorption over very long periods of daily usage is still questionable. The best option is to use coated zinc oxide.\n\n\n> * I don't really believe that antioxidants in sunscare work. Actives like Niacinamide, Licorice Extract or Green Tea Extract can be beneficial. The iron oxides in tinted products can help with protection against [infrared and visible light](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/606hwl/misc_how_much_truth_is_there_to_this_claim_on/df3v0la/). Although in my opinion it's often difficult to apply the recommendend amount of a tinted product in a way that it is invisible on skin.\n\n\n> All sunscreens are preferably free of:\n\n> * Oxybenzone,  Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Isoamyl p-Methoxycinnamate, Enzacamene\n\n> * Alcohol denat.\n\n> * Fragrance\n\n> * Irritating essential oils or plant extracts, like Eucalyptus, Mint, Citrus, Lavender, Bergamot oil etc.\n\n> * Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Diazolidinyl Urea etc\n\n\n> **Whitecast classification**: Since for me after ingredients, even a very slight whitecast is a big no for me, I made the following classification. **Do note that I apply 1.25-2.5mL, if you apply less, what most people do, almost all sunscreens will look great**.\n\n> * **0)** no whitecast\n\n> * **1)** no to barely visible whitecast. I would say 99% of the people won't notice any whitecast.\n\n> * **2)** slight whitecast. From this point you may notice, your skin may appear somewhat lighter. Most people would still consider this a sunscreen without a whitecast though. You can counteract the slight whitecast very easily with a small amount of foundation or powder, if you want.\n\n> * **3)** visible whitecast. This is what most people consider a sunscreen with whitecast. \n\n> * **4)** very visible, typical physical sunscreen whitecast. This is what you see with physical sunscreens from PC or from Badger for example.\n\n> **Shine**, order from most matte to least matte:\n\n> * Coola Matte, PC Resist, Neostrata, MUTI/Highdroxy, Avene Emulsion, Uncover Suncare, Ultrasun Tinted, Kruidvat Solait Face, Uriage Depiderm, Ultrasun untinted, Bioderma AR,Uncover Suncover, PC Calm Dry, Derma Ansigtcreme, Cotz Flawless Protection, Derma Sollotion SPF30/Rudolf Suncare,  Biodermal SPF50, Derma SPF50, Drs. Leenarts,  Mustela Bebe, Uriage Bariesun XP, Eubos Haut Ruhe SPF30, Badger SPF30 Tinted.\n\n\n> Physical sunscreens\n\n> * Although physical sunscreens are known for being non-sensitizing, stable and providing some protection against visible light, which are the main reasons why I still really like physical sunscreens, they were not my first choice, for three reasons. For me the **first** reason; I really don't want a sunscreen that makes my skin lighter than it already is, and physical sunscreens in my opinion all leave a whitecast when untinted. Most tinted version are simply visible on skin when you apply 1/4 tsp, and I don't like the thought that people might be thinking I'm wearing foundation as a guy. Physical sunscreens are just cosmetically less elegant than sunscreens with organic actives, they clump and streak. They are very difficult to rinse of your face as well. But of course YMMV. The **second** reason is that, as [KindofStephan](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/50n4s5/lets_bust_some_sunscreen_myths_why_calling_them/)\n already pointed out, \"modern organic sunscreens have better UVA absorption (which results in higher UVAPF ratings) than can be offered by inorganic sunscreens\" . Physical sunscreens also mainly work by absorbing (~95%) UV radiation ([link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpp.12214/abstract), [link](https://books.google.nl/books?id=rKHSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA202&dq=Textbook+of+Cosmetic+Dermatology+Inorganic+Filters&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiS--Ok0IHUAhVNPFAKHUwQC1wQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=Textbook%20of%20Cosmetic%20Dermatology%20Inorganic%20Filters&f=false)), so on that front there's not a huge difference with ingredients like Tinosorb M. The **third** reason is photocatalytic activiy of nano sized titanium dioxide. Most companies use nano titanium dioxide and nano zinc oxide, or anything with a median particle size just above 100nm to be able to sell it as a \"non-nano\" sunscreen, but then still a large parts falls in the nano range. These nano particles with todays knowledge appear to be safe, although long-term studies on daily usage are still scarce, the final EU Colipa report noted that trace amounts may remain in the sc, in hair follicles and sweat glands potentially over several days after application and washing. They may have photocatalytic activity and need very stable coatings. Colipa noted: \"It is less clear how stable the coatings are in final formulations. The particles were also found to induce oxidative stress in the cells indicated by a significant depletion of glutathione, induction of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation ([link](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_136.pdf)). “Part of the toxicity of nano ZnO is due to formation of reactive oxygen species, the impact in dermally applied cosmetic products is sofar unknown\" ([link](http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_103.pdf)). \n> \n>USA regulations are different than EU regulations. In the EU companies must declare if nano particles have been used on the ingredient list, where nano particles are defined as \"a natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and where, for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1nm – 100nm\". Thus a EU non-nano sunscreen can still contain a small percentage of nano particles. However in the US there is no definition of nano particles. Companies don't have to mention if they use nano particles, and are allowed to claim on their packaging what they want, they may refer to individual particles, agglomerates, different measurement techniques, since there are no guidelines or definitions for nano particles. Many \"non-nano\" USA sunscreens would have to be considered nano sunscreens according EU regulations.

    "body": "When I heard about this new product line the other day, I decided to look at all the products and their formulations via SkinCarisma to see whether anything looked worth trying. A few products seemed promising, while others seemed... not so much. I thought since I'd already done all the work, I'd share my findings here!\n\nIn order approximately from most to least promising:\n\nBlemish Control Spot Treatment, 5.5% Benzoyl Peroxide\n\n- **fungal acne safe!**\n- 5.5% is a higher concentration that necessary but shouldn't be too irritating\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both near end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (at end of ingred. list)\n- some nice **moisturizing** ingredients, including a good amount of squalane\n\nVitamin C Moisturizer\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 8th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (14th ingred.)\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane, lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- small amounts of cassia and green tea\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (9th ingred.)\n- advertises inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is last ingredient\n\nDark Spot Solution Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: polysorbate 20 (8th ingred.)\n- **niacinimide** is 2nd ingredient! brightening and anti-aging properties\n- advertises its inclusion of plankton extract but is 24th ingredient (also not much evidence that plankton extract does anything for skin besides moisturizing)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract  (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (last ingred.), citric acid (15th ingred.)\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- possible **allergen**: benzoyl alcohol\n- contains a lot of **silicones**\n\nRetinol Vitamin A Refining Moisturizer\n\n- amount of retinol isn't specified, but is placed 25th on ingredient list (you only need small amounts, 0.01% or more, to be effective, but need 0.5% or more for dramatic effects)\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.), polysorbate 20 (24th), cetyl palmitate (26th) \n- **retinol** has anti-acne, brightening, and anti-aging properties\n- other **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.), ceramide 3 (27th ingred.)\n- tons of aloe juice, good amount of squalane\n- small amounts of green tea and cassia\n- lots of good **moisturizing** ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- specifically advertises its inclusion of hyaluronic acid but is 26th (second last) on ingred. list\n\nOil-Free SPF 50 Moisturizing Sunscreen\n\n- broad spectrum\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl stearate (2nd ingredient), isopropyl palmitate (7th), PEG-100 stearate (8th)\n- **anti-acne** ingredients: licorice root extract, willow bark extract (both towards end of ingred. list)\n- **brightening** ingredients: licorice root\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: vitamin E (13th ingred.)\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: isopropyl palmitate (7th ingred.)\n- pretty small tube, only 50 mL\n\nFerulic Acid + Vitamins C and E Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for its vit C so is not a dupe for SkinCeuticals, but should still be effective\n- amounts of main ingredients not specified, however, vit C is the 5th ingredient, ferulic is 10th, vit E is 18th (second to last)\n- **brightening** ingredients: SAP\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E, citric acid, ferulic acid\n- citric acid (8th ingredient) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingredient)\n\nBio-Complex Moisturizer for Dry Skin\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n- claim to have a \"high level\" of hyaluronic acid, and contains 2 kinds, but they're only 21st and 22nd on ingredient list\n- also super unclear on what their \"bio-moist complex\" is but if it comprises 20% of the product it must just be like, aloe and water and glycerin\n- but yeah, tons of aloe and glycerin, good amount of squalane, some other **moisturizing** ingredients, moderate amount of green tea extract\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (14th ingred.), vitamin E (23rd)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: shea butter (8th ingred.)\n\nVitamin C + Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- uses **sodium ascorbyl phosphate** (SAP) for vit C, percentage is unclear but is listed as 5th ingredient \n- **anti-aging** ingredients: SAP, vitamin E (13th ingred.), citric acid (10th)\n- contains **denatured alcohol** (3rd ingred.)\n- citric acid may **irritate** sensitive skin\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: laureth-23 (4th ingred.)\n- HA is in the name and yet it's the last ingredient\n\nCharcoal Balancing Mask\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: PEG-100 stearate (9th ingred.), stearic acid (10th), glyceryl stearate (12th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- not sure how much charcoal is needed to be effective, but there may be a deceptively small amount in this, as it's the 16th ingredient and the product contains as much or more iron oxide as a colouring agent. also it lists \"charcoal powder\" and NOT \"activated charcoal powder\" so it may just be all-around useless.\n- advertises its use of hyaluronic acid yet it's the last ingredient \n- main mask component is **kaolin** clay (3rd ingred.)\n- 2 kinds of vitamin E (17th and 24th ingredients)\n- lots of aloe and some glycerin but not many other soothing or moisturizing ingredients\n- 1 potential **comedogen**: stearic acid (10th ingred.)\n\nHydrating Hyaluronic Acid Serum\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: contains polysorbate 80\n- claims to have 5 types of HA but I only counted 3: sodium hyaluronate, hydrolized HA, sodium acetylated hyaluronate (and they're all 18th or later in the ingredient list)\n- contains a TON of **silicone**, which seems like a poor choice to me, as HA should generally be applied earlier on in your routine and all that silicone will interfere with absorption of subsequent layers\n- no other notable or helpful ingredients, just a few **moisturizing** things like glycerin\n- more of a gel texture than a serum\n\nTriple-Peptide Eye Cream\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: stearic acid (3rd ingred.), glycol distearate (4th), shea butter (5th), ethylhexyl palmitate (8th)\n- **jar packaging**\n- peptides are last ingredient\n- contains ascorbic acid (vitamin C) but is 18th ingredient and what little benefit that amount gives will deteriorate due to air exposure from jar packaging\n- lots of aloe, good amount of squalane and caffeine\n- small amounts of green tea and green algae extract\n- 5 potential **comedogens** but this likely won't matter for the eye region\n- if you look up this product on Amazon to examine yourself, note that the copyable list of ingredients in the Important Information section is actually the ingredient list for the Retinol Moisturizer, so use the ingredients listed in the product images\n\nHydrating Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.), pomegranate seed oil (14th), coconut oil (15th), olive fruit oil (16th), argan oil (17th), jojoba oil (18th), babassu seed oil (20th), moringa seed oil (21st), crambe seed oil (23rd)\n- 2 potential **comedogens**: coconut oil (15th ingred.), avocado oil (19th)\n- in addition to above listed plant oils, also contains chia seed oil, the only non-problematic one lol\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- **surfectants** used: decyl glucoside and glyceryl oleate\n\nOil-Free Micellar Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **NOT fungal acne safe**: glyceryl oleate (4th ingred.)\n- **anti-aging** ingredients: citric acid (9th ingred.), vitamin E (12th)\n- citric acid and benzoic acid (6th ingred.) may be **irritating** to sensitive skin\n- micellar agents (**surfectants**) are decyl glucoside and glycerl oleate\n\nBlemish Control Oil-Free Facial Cleansing Wipes\n\n- **fungal acne safe**\n- advertises 2% **salicylic acid**, but unsure of the pH\n- **denatured alcohol** is the first ingredient!\n- contains grapefruit extract (3rd ingred.) - some sources say this is a great ingredient for skin, others say it's bad - I personally avoid it like I do all citrus-derived ingredients\n- contains **fragrance** (5th ingred.)\n- contains **sulfate**: sodium xylenesulfonate (13th ingred.)\n \nHope this is helpful! Let me know if I missed or got anything wrong!\n\nEdit: formatting\nEdit 2: butchered the spelling of \"comedogen\" all ten times I used it",

        "body": "> last ingred.\n\nJust in a \"the more you know\" way, that doesn't necessarily mean it's in a lower concentration than the ingredient that precedes it. In the US, ingredients in concentrations of 1% or lower can be listed in whatever order the manufacturer wants to use. You can sometimes tell where that <1% begins if the product contains phenoxyethanol, because that's approved for use in concentrations of up to 1% -- meaning things *after* that are either at 1% or under.\n\n(Also, 1% HA isn't unusual, nor is it necessarily ineffective; it's normally used at/in concentrations of 0.2-2%. TO often uses 2% because of their unofficial \"more is **always** better\" philosophy [looking at you, 10% niacinamide serum], but <2% can be beneficial, too!)\n\nThat said, you'd think there'd be little reason for Amazon to list a \"banner\" ingredient at the very end when/if they have the option to list it earlier/higher.",

    "body": "After starting [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/510zfo/should_we_be_using_low_ph_shampoo/) yesterday, I decided to put together a list featuring ABers' suggestions (from that post) and the results of my own research. Perhaps in due time we can have another spreadsheet as ppl begin pH testing their own products... but here's what I have for  now! (and ofc I'm happy to update this list w/ any comments that come into this post << I have not done this yet for this post, will update at end of day or so!!)      \n\nI'm lumping shampoos & body washes together b/c IMO surfactants are surfactants are surfactants so any body wash can be used on the hair and vice versa (and face, honestly, if the ingreds are gentle enough - but as it so happens, few of these are)   \n\n- don't laugh yall, but one of the lowest pH & lowest cost options out here is ~intimates~ body wash. our lady gardens have a low pH and so do the washes designed for that area.    \nSummer's Eve is quite inexpensive, you can get 45oz (15oz x3) for only $13 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=summer%27s+eve)! simple ingredients too: *Purified Water, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ammonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Fd&C Blue No. 1*. those who are prone to SD are advised to avoid SLES & SLS, but some can tolerate ALES, so I might try this for shampoo - why not?! my husband might be a little confused but whatevs #killinthegame     \n[and as for exactly what pH it is, website says: *Summer’s Eve’s pH-balanced products are formulated to be in harmony with the areas on which they are used. For topical application to the skin, they are formulated for a slightly acidic pH (about 5-6). For application to the vagina, they are formulated for mildly acidic pH (a pH of about 3.0-3.5).* I'm not certain which category washes fall under lol]\n\n- [Aqua Glycolic](http://www.aquaglycolic.com/product-aqua-glycolic-shampoo-body-cleanser) makes a pH 4.5 shampoo/body wash with 14% glycolic acid, retails ~$16/8 oz      \n\n- [Neutrogena T-Sal](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/t-sal-+therapeutic+shampoo+-+scalp+build-up+control.do?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PLA+-+Hair+-+SKU&utm_term=&utm_content=|mkwid|sQN6gfQPl_dc|pcrid|121181768720) has long been my go-to during SD flareups, a bit pricy to use regularly though (~$7/4.5 oz). it's 3% salicylic acid and I remember reading somewhere the pH is ~4.5     \n\n- everything from [Sebamed](https://www.sebamedusa.com/facial-cleanser#?offset=0&limit=24) is listed as pH 5.5, with the exception of a feminine care wash that's listed as 3.8 (I've seen it on some etailers but not on their official website, possibly DC'ed?) & a post-menopausal feminine care wash listed as 6.0; their shampoos and body washes aren't cheap tho. Cerave foaming is cheaper per oz <-- not sure how it would fare as a shampoo, but I bet Cerave would be a perfectly fine option for body wash!   \n\n- u/ms_moonlight recommends shampoos from \"*Keracare. It's marketed towards black women, but anyone can use it.*\" this makes sense, as relaxers are often super basic, so acidic shampoos are very important. after researching this brand a bit, I can confirm that all of their shampoos & conditioners list their pH on the front! I've seen anything from [4.5](https://www.amazon.com/AVLON-Keracare-Lather-Shampoo-Ounce/dp/B0054Y1KO2/ref=sr_1_10_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1473012244&sr=8-10&keywords=keracare+shampoo)-6 (and even lower for their conditioners). sells for about $10/8 oz (but you can find cheaper) to under $20/1L, easily available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keracare+shampoo)!\n\n- Many salon/higher end brands are labeled with pH 4.5-5.5; of these, Joico can often be obtained relatively inexpensively at $20-30 for 1L, but u/oliviart123 cautions: *NEVER buy (american) professional salon brands anywhere OTHER than a licenced salon. It is illegal for someone to sell them on amazon/ebay and at drugstores like target/walgreens/walmart, even costco. Theres a huge black market for counterfeit salon products which is why you \"see\" them everywhere. No salon brand actually sells on amazon and most of the bottles will say its only gaurenteed to be legit IF purchased from a licensed salon.*   \nrelated, I know [Sally Beauty](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shampoo/Hair01,default,sc.html#~EDGE~!sort.axis__default~~!page.size__48~~page.number__1~~!curated.hair_solutions__Color%20Protect!~EDGE~) tends to have a lot of pro-quality stuff at pleb prices, so I'd be interested to see if any of their shampoos list pH's   \nalso, I believe Nexxus Therappe is also in the correct range\n\n- u/julietpae suggests [Malibu C](https://www.malibuc.com/catalog/cn/60/shampoos) shampoos *Malibu products are designed from a Vitamin C/ascorbic acid complex that is proven to stop and prevent oxidizers from effecting your hair. Most of all their products are vegan/gluten/sulfate/paraben and fragrance free* I haven't been able to confirm their pH anywhere, but maybe it's listed on the bottle?    \n\n- lastly, not surfactants, but u/im_twelve_ and u/thee_zohan both recommend the Herbal Essences cleansing conditioners. u/okayzac adds: it's good to use something purifying still once in awhile. Things like cleansing conditioners that do not provide any surfactant cleanse can potentially lead to hair loss (i.e Wen is being sued over this) we can build up the hormone DHT which when we reach too high of levels can lead to hair loss.   \n\n    FYI: any \"no more tears\" baby shampoo probably has pH ~7\n\n\n**Asian/international products**   \n\n- Lador acid shampoo: pH 4.5, $8/150ml from [Memebox](https://us.memebox.com/damage-protector-acid-shampoo?pdref=category)   \n\n- u/noys has pH tested Ryoe damage care shampoo as 5.5, kracie moisturizing shampoo 5.5-6. u/okayzac lists the Ryoe anti-aging shampoo as HG (not pH tested, but hopefully similar!)  \n\n- u/marybanana says the Ka'fen acid shampoo series (marketed towards color protection) from Taiwan lists *shampoo is 5.4, and the conditioner is 4.0. It's been two weeks, and my scalp has shown distinct improvement* but hasn't found a good ordering source yet  \n\n- u/xomandark *Whamisa has a line of shampoo (one for oily scalp, one for dry scalp) and they are both pH 4.5. I used the dry version for quite some time and it was pretty soothing to my easily irritated scalp. They also have a scalp tonic which is THE BEST at calming irritation* ordered from testerkorea   \n\n- breathlessly waiting for the exact brand name from u/neko-miko *Since I started Keratin treatments, I had to stop using shampoo with sulphates and sodium chloride.\nAfter searching for a while (and using the Sebamed shampoo which was fine and also cheaper in Germany), I now use a super cheap low-ph shampoo / shower gel combo made for kids which fulfills all my requirements and costs less than 1€.\nI haven't had any scalp problems since.*   \n\n- Eucerin makes a [pH 5 shampoo](http://int.eucerin.com/products/dermocapillaire/ph5-mild-shampoo) but it doesn't seem very easy to order (or at least, I'm not nearly as savvy with sources for ordering from Europe as from Asia haha)    \n\n\nIf you google around, pplz on the Internet have also done some pH testing, e.g. [here](http://www.thenaturalhavenbloom.com/2012/02/ph-of-shampoo-ultimate-list.html), [here](http://forums.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=90642), [here](http://acovant.com/shampoo.html)",

I've been washing my face with a \"feminine hygiene gel\" for 3 weeks now (for Europeans: **Facelle intim Waschlotion Sensitive**, available in Rossmann) and it's been great. I wasn't expecting fireworks, it's just a cleanser, but it does the job very well, no tightness, no irritation. And it just couldn't get any cheaper! I've been meaning to start using it all over my body, but I have this deliciously smelling shower gel that I can't give up just yet :)\nThe pH is 4,5, it almost doesn't foam at all with hands, but foams nicely with a konjac sponge.  \n  \nIngredients:\n*Aqua, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Sorbitol, Urea, Propylene Glycol, Allantoin, C12-15 Alkyl Lactate, Parfum, Serine, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Persea Gratissima Fruit Extract, Ethoxydiglycol, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid*\n \n\nSorry this isn't AB, but I felt the need to share this fantastic discovery. Maybe somebody who has access to Rossmann would use this information. Having said that, I'd recommend checking ingredients. \"Feminine hygiene gels\" usually have lower pH than shower gels (though not always!), but many of them contain harsh surfactants and other ingredients that could dry or irritate the skin.  \n  \nEdit: missing word",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis.

And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula.

I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying.

In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "I’m about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here’s what I’ve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won’t directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn’t use silicones, she couldn’t protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove. NEVER USE THESE!:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone \n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone \n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18 \n\n-Cetyl Phosphate \n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiylamodimethicone \n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n*\n#Mild Sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nThese are Best used to remove airy and friendly silicones and in your regular, daily mild shampoo. These do NOT remove resilient silicones. \n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate \n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate \n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate \n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate \n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n*\n#High Strength HARSH sulfate-FREE Surfactants:\n\nTreat these exactly like harsh sulfates and avoid them when looking for a regular, daily mild sulfate-free shampoo. BEST USED FOR REMOVING RESILIENT SILICONES:\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate \n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n*\n#SULFATES that remove silicones:\nThese strong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Mild sulfates May require more applications to remove resilient silicones:\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n*\n#Also here is a list of cationic (anti-static) ingredients:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n*\n#So basically:\n\n1. Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!! Avoid these ingredients in hair care products: \n\nhttps://airtable.com/shrXz5xqoqRg8yKI2/tblol3s4T5YH103yY\n\nIt is hard to find a product with NONE of these ingredients, so make sure that these

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium chloride and Cetrimonium chloride are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling, anti-frizz, and anti-static  \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

        "body": "I would also like to make a comment on phrasing! If she has thigh-length hair, that's probably at least partially because of genetics. If the terminal length of your hair is way shorter, no amount product is going to fix that, at least not to that extent.  No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that). I know there's some research with using brown rice water (I think) to improve the terminal length, but I'm not sure how accurate it is, how much it's been tested, or the details.\n\nNot a scientist, so please correct me if I'm wrong!",

Also some of the other information seems to be inline with what this \"challenge\" promotes. Some of the information might be true, but I've seen this trick before. A service will give some true information, and then make other information appear overly complicated (sometimes twisting information as they go) so customers of their service will eventually get frustrated trying to figure it out (but not before giving them money). give up, and buy their \"good\" products (for more money).",

    "body": "Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8oqn32/discussion_anybody_has_gotten_hold_of_the_small/) post by /u/nikarphar and /u/CassandraBlack 's question, I tested if my blacklight was able to reveal my sunscreen and if my phone could catch it up. \n  \n  \n\n\nYou can see all the pics in the [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/6Tzysdh):   \n\nNear the elbow I used the Avéne Lait enfant 50+, while the middle one is Avéne Sunsimed (not a cosmetic, but a “medical device” – [independent tests](https://www.regard-sur-les-cosmetiques.fr/nos-regards/sunsimed-ou-la-protection-solaire-a-deux-vitesses-215/) report a UVB protection factor of 60 and UVA of 30). The rest of the arm is perfectly clean of cosmetics (but full of white dust! 😂). I didn't have any AB sunscreen at the moment but I was thinking of trying foundation with SPF and maybe a before/after in the evening... How much sunscreen stays on my body after X hours?\n\nThe lamp I used, I bought many years ago. I am not able to tell which wavelenght it produces (/u/katherine-the-wild can you help?).  \n\nPhone: iPhone SE\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n>Avéne Lait enfant 50+ INCI: *Avene thermal spring water (avene aqua), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, dicaprylyl carbonate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, water (aqua), glycerin, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol, methoxyphenl triazine, diethylhexyl butamido, triazone, diisopropyl adipate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, cetearyl isononanoate, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2, dipolyhydroxystearate, decyl glucoside, benzoic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, disodium EDTA, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl dibehenate, hydrogenated palm glycerides, hydrogenated palm kernel glycerides, polyacrylate-13, polyisobutene, polysorbate 20, propylene glycol, sorbitan, isostearate, tocopherol, tocopheryl glucoside tribehenin, xanthan gum.* \n\n>Avéne Sunsimed INCI: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Nano), Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzoic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Excipients* (being a medical device I wasn't able to find a complete list of ingredients).  \n\n\nEDIT: Sorry but I wasn't comfortable sharing pictures of my face. But the sunscreen showed up reeeally well and I could see all of the spots I missed. I also could see all the sun damage and hyperpigmentation that isn't visible under regular lights. 😭   \nIf anyone else has a blacklight available and could test it with other sunscreens, I would be very curious to see the results! Thanks everyone!",

It might have to do with applying a higher concentration to the swatch than you normally would to your face, and because it’s easier to get even coverage on a small, flat surface than in all little contours of your face. I also found that it only really works with physical sunscreens. The black light is looking for the white pigment in titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to bounce off of, so it works best with physical sunscreens, not as well with combo sunscreens, and almost not at all with chemical sunscreens.",

Not lux obviously but I feel the brand is discussed frequently within this group. \n\nInstant observations upon the first test that I ***must*** do right when I take a product out of the box lol: \n\nHalf & Half is more viscous than I expected. I imagine it would perform really well under makeup, or for someone with oily skin. For myself it wouldn’t be enough alone. I’m excited to try it as a hydrating toner. \n\nMulti-Quench feels great on the skin, I’m a sucker for glycerin and it has a nice texture. \n\nMilk Peel has a nice light texture, and is very mildly hydrating. \n\nI will update you all once I finish the bottles. \n\n____________\nMulti Acid Milk Peel: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, C13-14 Isoalkane, C11-12 Isoalkane, Phytic Acid, Malic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lipase, Protease, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, C15-23 Alkane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Phenoxyethanol, Tricaprylin, Glyceryl Oleate, Ethylhexyl Polyhydroxystearate, Tetradecane, C13-14 Alkane, Decyl Glucoside, Maltodextrin, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Sclerotium Gum, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Carrageenan, Silica.\n\nHalf & Half Fluid Moisturizer: \n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Propanediol, Isopropyl Myristate, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Ceramide NP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide NS, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Hexapeptide-11, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Triolein, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Glyceryl Oleate, Undecane, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Dioleate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Tridecane, Betaine, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Sodium PCA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lactate, PCA, Sodium Benzoate, Serine, Alanine, Palmitic Acid, Glycine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glutamic Acid, Lysine HCl, Threonine, Arginine, Proline, Tocopherol, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20.\n\nMulti Quench Plumping Hydration Serum:\n\n-Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Polyglutamic Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ectoin, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract, Erythritol, Phenoxyethanol, Propanediol, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tocopherol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\n",

I don’t know what it is, but I just vibe with that brand so much (except their sunscreens, which fall a bit short for me personally). I say this all the time, too, because I know people get so suspicious of comments on Reddit and people being paid plants or something, but I’m absolutely not affiliated with them at all! LOL Shit, I wish they supplied me with products! \n\nAnyway, Half & Half is my new favorite thing!! I’m really loving it. I do run oily, so I can use it alone during the day and be good. Or, I layer it under a heavier moisturizer at night just to amp up hydration and moisture. \n\nThe Multi Acid Milk Peel is interesting as well. I haven’t used it as frequently yet, since I just finished a procedure, so I’ve been pretty gentle and boring lately. But I do like it for a nice exfoliator. \n\nMulti-Quench I’ve been using for awhile and it’s great as well. But I think I love Half & Half better!

I bought a bottle of it cuz I was out of my Ordinary Glycolic Acid that I use on my body and also my Dr Dennis Gross Peel Pads for my face (was waiting for their sale to restock my big box. Been using these for a couple years). Now I’ve been using the Prequel on my face and body since January and plan on sticking with it. My skin looks and feels incredible. More hydrating than the DDG pads but still leaves that beautiful glow, pores are looking good, and my skin just looks nice and bouncy. AND it hasn’t irritated my rosacea (I also use Tret every other night). And for my body- no reappearance of KP on my legs or backs of arms, no booty acne, no ingrown hairs on my bikini line or underarms, knees and elbows are super soft, all of my skin texture in general is smooth af. And as long as it’s not crazy hot out, I can skip deodorant as long as I pat a bit of it under my arms. It’s light years better than the Ordinary acid\n\nAnd I was thinking about picking up these other two products. The Half and Half in particular seems like would be perfect as a daytime moisturizer in my ridiculously hot and swampy weather\n\nTheir Gleanser, Vit C, and Urea moisturizer are already at HG status for me",

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": " Chega de CC \n\nResolvi escrever este texto, como uma ajuda às pessoas que sofrem de bromidrose, coloquialmente chamada de CC (sigla para Cheiro de Corpo), sofri com este mal durante minha adolescência e mesmo em 2023 este tópico ainda é mal-entendido, estigmatizado e delicado de ser tratado, então como um serviço à cidadania venho aqui expor meu conhecimento sobre o tópico e ajudar aos que precisam. \n\nBom, primeiramente preciso dizer que o mau odor da bromidrose é causado por bactérias, o suor em si é inodoro (não possui cheiro). As bactérias causadoras do CC são chamadas Staphylococous hominis e são exclusivas dos humanos, elas se alimentam do suor e pele morta e o odor fétido refere-se aos seus dejetos, sim o CC é cocô de bactéria, a seguir vou listar dicas para eliminar de vez este mal: \n\n1º Desinfecção das roupas: \n\nMuitas vezes eu chegava em casa sentindo o odor desagradável e quando tirava minha camisa e cheirava minhas axilas elas estavam perfumadas, porém minha camisa não, isso é causado, porque as bactérias formam um biofilme, que as protegem da ação de agentes antibióticos, este biofilme é formado tanto na pele quanto nas roupas e por isso que mesmo quando lavamos as roupas muitas vezes o mau odor continua impregnado, para isso há alternativas: (Lembrando que esse processo não precisa ser feito todas as vezes que for lavar, apenas no início da desinfecção) Lave as roupas com água morna para quente, em torno de 50ºC até 75ºC no máximo; na região das axilas use um solvente, pode ser removedor (desses que vendem em supermercado ou limpador multiuso), aplique nas roupas úmidas - na região das axilas - da água quente e deixe agindo cerca de 5 minutos, você vai perceber que os resíduos de desodorante e suor começam a sair em pedaços, esfregue delicadamente, pode ser necessário repetir o processo algumas vezes dependendo do estado da peça de roupa, em seguida enxague com a água morna, depois lave as roupas como de costume (pode ser com água fria) e acrescente na máquina ou no molho meia xícara de desinfetante, preferencialmente como o ativo Cloreto Benzalcônico (boa parte dos desinfetantes para casa o possuem), depois é só enxaguar. Após retirados os resíduos não precisa mais usar o removedor no dia a dia, contudo a parte de lavar as roupas com desinfetante, sim é preciso lavar todas as vezes e não, a roupa não fica com cheiro de desinfetante, apenas do detergente ou amaciante que você usou. \n\n2ª Desinfecção das axilas ou virilhas \n\nComo eu disse anteriormente as bactérias formam um biofilme muito resistente e difícil de remover, em situações hospitalares podem causar problemas sérios. Precisamos remover os resíduos de antiperspirante que ficam na pele, geralmente esses resíduos são formados por silicones e polímeros a fim de fazer o ativo redutor de suor penetrar mais profundamente na pele e inibir a formação do biofilme das bactérias, contudo boa parte das pessoas não sabem que é necessário remover o desodorante e quase sempre o sabonete comum não o retira por completo. As alternativas que funcionaram para mim: Água micelar, testei várias e todas retiraram os resíduos umas mais eficientemente do que outras, mas retiraram. Aplicar generosamente com um disco de algodão e passar nas axilas antes do banho em seguida lavar normalmente com seu sabonete de costume. Outra opção são limpadores líquidos com o surfactante Decyl Glucoside, esse surfactante dissolve muito bem o dimeticone, que é o silicone usado na maioria dos antiperspirantes, os que já testei com sucesso foram dois sabonetes infantis o primeiro Protex Baby líquido e o Granado Baby liquido, ao passar de imediato os pedaços de resíduos descolam-se das axilas. Outra alternativa (esta apenas para desinfectar, os resíduos não são retirados) é aplicar com algodão Povidine e deixar agir por 15 minutos, o iodo presente na fórmula consegue penetrar o biofilme produzido pelas bactérias e as elimina. \n\nOs antiperspirantes precisam ser removidos, diariamente, pois o acúmulo nos poros pode ocasionar a proliferação de bactérias (outras além das que produzem o mau odor) causando infecções como furúnculos, por exemplo, o que faz muitas pessoas acreditarem que seus desodorantes pararam de funcionar e ficam trocando de fabricante, sendo que o problema não está no produto. \n\n3ª Aplicação \n\nA melhor forma de aplicar os antiperspirantes é após o banho, antes de dormir, com as axilas limpas se totalmente secas, de duas a três camadas e em seguida esperar secar totalmente. A aplicação noturna se mostra mais eficiente devido à temperatura do corpo que baixa durante o sono, impedindo em tese que a gente produza suor, fazendo com que o produto possa agir por mais tempo, diminuindo assim de forma mais eficaz a ação das glândulas sudoríparas. É recomendável também hidratar a região das axilas, pois é uma área de pele fina e atrito, por isso pelos crescem nesta parte, afim de proteger, passar hidratante antes do antiperspirante, desde que esperando secar não compromente em nada a ação dos ativos e ainda reforça a barreira protetora natural da pele.  \n\nDepois que eu desenvolvi esta rotina nunca mais tive odores desagradáveis nas axilas ou virilhas, aplico cerca de 1 vez ao mês o Povidine nas axilas de forma preventiva, lavo minhas roupas com desinfetante, uso sabonete infantil para retirar os resíduos de desodorante e aplico o antiperspirante antes de dormir, é tudo muto rápido e não gasto tempo a mais nessa rotina. Não uso um desodorante específico, todos funcionam para mim, até porque a fórmula de quase todos é muito similar o que varia é a quantidade e o tipo de alumínio usado como ativo. Uso também desodorantes sem alumínio e funcionam igualmente. Espero ter ajudado. \n\nRessaltando que este post é sobre bromidrose ou CC - mau odor das axilas - e não sobre hiperidrose, que é a produção excessiva de suor.",

Nada nunca funcionou, limpeza nenhuma deu jeito, lisoform, limão, amido de milho, óleo de côco, bicarbonato de sódio, hidratante, leite de magnésia, eu tentei de tudo. Só o que eu podia fazer era entupir as axilas com antitranspirante, e as vezes nem era o suficiente.\n\n Enfim, a pouco tempo descobri qual era a raiz do problema. Acontece que eu tenho intolerância a lactose, na verdade parece que sempre tive desde a infância, mas minha mãe achou que meu cocô mole era parte da minha personalidade, sei lá. \n\nEu sigo uma endocrinologista no insta e ela estava falando dos sintomas do sistema inflamado. Eu parei de consumir laticínios, sem muita esperança, só estava fazendo um teste. E não é que era isso mesmo?! Meu cc era um sintoma de inflamação por eu consumir lactose e lascar meu intestino.\n\nEntão, pra quem faz tudo isso aí e não tem resultado, como eu, seu problema pode ser algo maior. Pode ser seu fígado, sua tireóide, seu intestino, e a lista é longa.",

        "body": "Tenho experiência no assunto. Passei décadas lutando contra a bromidose e camisetas fedorentas. Agora estou curado. E é curioso como, muitas vezes, você não fede, apenas as camisetas. Aqui vão minhas dicas.\n\n  \n1) Não use desodorante Antitranspirante/Antiperspirante se você transpira de mais. Por mais contraditório que possa parecer, não recomendo porque o anti transpirante gruda nas tramas do tecido e vira uma colônia de bactérias, como o OP bem falou.   \nAtualmente, eu utilizo os desodorantes corporais em spray do O Boticário. Eles custam cerca de R$ 33,00, são a base de álcool e óleos essenciais e você pode comprar só o refil depois que acabar. Tipo esse aqui: [https://http2.mlstatic.com/D\\_NQ\\_NP\\_904713-MLB48738023744\\_012022-O.webp](https://http2.mlstatic.com/D_NQ_NP_904713-MLB48738023744_012022-O.webp)) \n\nOutro que utilizo é o Desodorante Spray Sem Perfume da Lafe´S (R$ 58,00 na Amazon). Infelizmente, não se encontram mais desodorantes desse tipo facilmente. Acredito que os desodorantes a base de álcool da Natura (R$ 38,00 a R$ 44,00) e da Avon (de R$ 10,00 a 35,00) e os Veganos funcionem bem também.  \n\n\n2) Paralelamente ao abandono dos Antitranspirante, você deve fazer um \"detox\" nas axilas, eliminando os resíduos de antitranspirante que estão grudados lá. Além das dicas do OP, eu sugiro o uso regular de suco de limão ou iodo desgermante (nomes comerciais povidine, povidona) toda vez que sua axila feder. Funciona de verdade. Se feder novamente (e vai feder), use de novo. Assim como aqueles que lutam contra o peso a vida toda, pessoas como eu tem de lutar contra o cecê a vida toda (kkkkkk). Atenção, o limão e o iodo tem a função de matar os germes que estão ali produzindo o fedor, o uso do desodorante ainda se faz necessário após a higienização e o banho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.1 Para o limão, em primeiro lugar, o limão é ácido e pode causar reações nas peles mais sensíveis.  Caso ocorra alguma reação, lave imediatamente o local e tente outra opção. Você também pode tentar diluir um pouco do limão em agua para ficar menos agressivo. Para aplicar, esprema meio limão e passe nas axilas com um algodão (um algodão para cada axila, para uma não contaminar a outra). Passe 15 minutos antes de tomar banho. Você pode reaplicar se achar necessário. Você também pode passar para dormir a noite e retirar pela manhã. Em hipótese nenhuma passe limão nas axilas e saia ao sol, pois pode manchar sua pele e causar queimaduras. \n\n2.2 Para o uso do iodo, basta seguir as instruções da embalagem ou assista esse vídeo aqui, pois tem contra indicações: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyQfcdb6rY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jyQfcdb6rY)  \n\n\nVeja o poder do limão contra bactérias e germes aqui:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4QzysRUQn0Y](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4QzysRUQn0Y)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Uma vez formada, essa meleca não pode ser removida com água e sabão, apenas solvente de base oleosa. Eu usei Querosene de limpeza (500ml custa de R$ 10,00 a 16,00) diretamente na região das axilas nas camisetas completamente secas. Então esfrega-se com vigor até a mancha sair. A macha pode ser visualizada colocando a peça contra a luz (você verá que as tramas do tecido ficam \"entupidas\" e não dá pra ver o outro lado perfeitamente) ou borrifar água com um pulverizador (a parte onde está com a meleca não absorve a água rapidamente) . Eu prefiro usar a querosene com a camisa ainda seca para a limpeza ser mais eficiente. \n\nAqui tem um exemplo na prática: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXWr\\_cDBi3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXWr_cDBi3M)\n\nApós isso, você tira o excesso da querosene com água e sabão (sabão de côco ou detergente de lavar louças). Após isso é só pôr na máquina com sabão e desinfetante e lavar normalmente. Não se espante se o cheiro da querosene permanecer nas roupas após tirar da máquina de lavar, pois o cheiro se dissipará a medida que a peça de roupa seque.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Para prevenir o mau cheiro em camisetas que ainda não passaram pela limpeza ou não ficaram completamente limpas, antes de vestir, eu aplicava Lysoform Aerosol (custa em média R$ 20,00, desse aqui: [https://vicell.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Desinfetante-Lysoform-aerosol-360-ml-bactericida-scaled.jpg](https://vicell.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Desinfetante-Lysoform-aerosol-360-ml-bactericida-scaled.jpg)) diretamente na região da axila com a camisa seca. Aplique um ou mais dias antes do uso para que o desinfetante seque e o cheiro não fique tão presente.",

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  “Many persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier. I think I finally found my protein balance!)*\n\n - **Sukin Organics Nourishing Conditioner** *(100% carbon neutral and cruelty free. Contains cetrimonium chloride, aloe, and hydrolyzed protein. Good slip.)*\n\n - **As I Am Coconut CoWash** *(Lightweight, leaves my hair very bouncy and shiny with LOTS of texture. Great slip, very moisturizing, rinses clean.)*\n\n - **Tresemme Naturals** *(haven't used it but often recommended, contains drying alcohols low on the list, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Giovanni Brazilian Keratin & Argan Oil Ultra Sleek Conditioner** *(haven't tried, recommended)*\n\n - **Suave Naturals** *(haven't used, often recommended, range of options, some have NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **As I Am Cleansing Pudding** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*   \n\n - **Curl Junkie Daily Fix Cleansing Conditioner** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains yucca, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Darcy's Botanicals Daily Cleansing Conditioner Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, contains wax, label says NO SURFACTANTS but it has BTMS, a very mild cationic, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Jessicurl Hair Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\n - **Curly Q's Curlie Cutie Cleansing Cream** *(haven't tried, made for this, NO PENETRATING OILS)*\n\nDeep Conditioning:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner** *(contains shea butter, aloe, panthenol, and coconut oil, some of my favorite ingredients; NO SURFACTANTS, also contains emulsifying wax so should be used sparingly)*, **Cold pressed coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair, protects protein bonds, but a little bit goes a very long way! Also very comedogenic for most people, be careful of it near your face. Excellent as a pre-poo treatment. Not ideal for chemically colored hair, because of it's penetrative abilities it can remove the color molecules.)*  \n\nShampooing:  \n**Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo** *(uses the gentlest surfactant on the market, decyl glucoside, NO PENETRATING OILS, [break down here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1l4sjc/product_recommendation_community_survey_shampoos/cc0o2kz))*  \n\nClarifying Shampoo:  \n**Malibu Swimmers Water Action Shampoo** *(no sulfates but still effective combo of surfactants and ingredients that remove mineral build up, panthenol, smells like orange push pops...)*\n\nDry Shampoo:  \nThe best one I ever tried from the store was **Dove.** I prefer to just make my own with arrowroot powder and cocoa powder. Corn starch is popularly recommended and the ingredient in most of these dry shampoos that soaks up the oil, but I find that the arrowroot is finer and disappears better.",

        "body": "So, /u/SnooSnooCookie asked me about a specific conditioner, [Matrix Total Results Color Care Conditioner](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?um=1&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=G7g&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=878&tbm=isch&tbnid=1Qc4icCLLeYB4M:&imgrefurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/shopping/DYH0200911KK0158.htm&docid=vQoU3xg8hp02dM&imgurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/upload/2011/matrix-total-results-color-care-soin-couleur-conditioner-10-1.jpg&w=221&h=550&ei=7rktUrOVBIbPkQWjmoCwCA&zoom=1&ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:80&iact=rc&page=1&tbnh=194&tbnw=80&start=0&ndsp=30&tx=10&ty=102), for COwashing. Here's a break down of it with some helpful resources for you guys.\n\nGenerally, I'll just google the ingredients in a product one by one; eventually you start to remember what's good and what's bad.  I'd say MAYBE it'd be a suitable COwash, but I think you can do a lot better, especially for the price. Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

But here is my question - how in the world do you sleep on your hair so that it is still wearable the next day?? Not referring to the oily hair, which would be diminished by this new hair-washing technique, but the crazy, tangly roughed-up looking hair that I wake up with? Any tips or advice on this? Like I said, I feel silly asking about this, but I cant remember a time where I didnt wake up and shower first thing in the morning before going to school/work, so I've never had to worry or think about \"bed head\". Thank you!! :)",

        "body": "Hello! Thanks for all the info I’m so excited to try! A few questions to make sure I understand correctly: \n\nI’m worried about the adjustment period, so I want to alternate co wash and shampooing like you said. So I should start with a clarifying shampoo, and then use a gentle poo? At what point should I use the clarifying shampoo again? \n\nAlso you mentioned the Trader Joe’s conditioner but they make several, which one do you recommend? Thanks! \n\nCurrently I only clean my hair every other day. Should I be I washing everyday or is every other day cowashing/shampooing ok? \n\nI excersize often and my hair gets very sweaty. Does this change anything? \n\nThanks!",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n* **Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics (SPF50+ PA++++)**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1530 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1200 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : dry, sensitive, acne prone and combination\n\n**texture and appearance** : creamy white lotion (ya nasty-). unscented ( ha, ha , aur socho ashleel cheeze 🤡)\n\n**ingredients list :**   Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Water, Glycerin, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Behenyl Alcohol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Sodium Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Water, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/​VP Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Silica, Caprylyl/​Capryl Glucoside, Sorbitan Oleate, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Bifida Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacillus Ferment,Streptococcus Thermophilus Ferment\n\n**filters :**\n\n* uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nthis deserves all the hype it gets on the net. my current and forever HG sunscreen (unless they change formulation). seriously this ticks all the boxes . no whitecast? check. great filters? check. doesn't make you face look like you rub pan grease on it? check. it absorbs so well and is more moisturizing than some of the moisturizers out there. obviously, wished we would get more quantity for the price paid but itna criticise karne ke baad bhi, brands toh behre hai 😔and on reapplication, doesnt feel like im doing the 100 layers challenge lol. plus , I don't feel regret when applying it these days, cuz no fear of sunscreen melting during winters (#rajailife) . *taareef karu kya uski, jisneee tujhe banayaaaa✨\\~*\n\n**rating :** 5/5 and forever HG\n\n* **Benton Mineral Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 15g (haalat kharab biros). got it at 30% on beauty barn\n\n**For skin types** : normal and sensitive skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : a white stick. that's it. kind of a really thick lotion like texture. unscented and smol. mineral sunstick.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Coco-caprylate/caprate, sunflower seed wax, propylene glycol dicaprylate, H-di/trimethylol hexyllactone cross polymer, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, titanium dioxide, dicaprylyl carbonate, Synthetic fluorphlogopite, vinyl dimethicone, microcrystalline wax, aluminum stearate, polyhydroxystearic acid, purslane extract, centella extract, sodium hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, sodium Acetylated hyaluronate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, polyglyceryl-4diisostearate/polyhydroxystearate/sebacate, silica, alumina, pentylene glycol, allantoin, panthenol, Glycerin, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Xylyl Glucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Glucose, Glyceryl Caprylate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Stearic Acid, Tocopherol, Purified Water, 1, 2-hexanediol, ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**filters** :\n\n* titanium dioxide\n\nthis one came around the same time as the tocobo sunstick on beauty barn so being the ✨phisool kharchi wala baccha✨, I bought both of them. unfortunately , this one was a big letdown. how tf can a sunstick leave a whitecast? this one is a great example. first off, it requires a lot of pressing and dragging across the face to dispense , so not fond of that, especially when I have active acne. secondly, it legit looks like someone rubbed fair and lovely mixed with water on my face 💀. its not waterproof, expensive for the quantity you get and gives a disappointing finish and result. I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao. I used it as a body stick most of the time with how oily this was. but can be used by anyone ig\n\n**texture and appearance** : whitish yellow stick. has a fruity kind of smell. really oily and greasy on first application that doesn't absorb or goes away after a while.\n\n**ingredients list** :  Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyethylene, Isohexadecane, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Synthetic Beeswax, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Dimethicone, Diethylhexyl 2,6-Naphthalate, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, BHT\n\n**filters** :\n\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n\noof this was an impulse purchase that I regretted later on. mind you, this is a great sunstick for your body but definitely not for your face . not to mention its waterproof . but the tapti garmi really just melts everything in its way and this is no exception. bhai itna chip chipa lagta hai i dont even feel like putting this on just because of the MoIsT feeling it gives. unless you're going to a pool or beach (as it suggests duh) , if you're okay with feeling like [that peanut butter baby](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Flife%2Ffamily%2Fthis-peanut-butter-baby-is-sure-to-brighten-up-your-day-31499579.html&psig=AOvVaw0Qc7SXcD436wP5Ywrn_yJv&ust=1678212392776000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCIDzt77yx_0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) , then you can give it a try. it  does provide a good amount of product for the price and is a solid waterproof one fosho. but nahi jhela jata for some reason 😣😣😫\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\nme after buying and trying all of these to find my HG\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zzjpjrbly9ma1.gif\n\nbut it was fun doing this in a span of a few years and I finally got one that fits all my boxes . the BOJ one is seriously godsent for me ✨✨~~lets just ignore that it makes my wallet cry every time I buy it .~~ But id rather spend more on stuff that works than just hit and trials lmao. also I've gone past my obsession on using sun sticks as a whole since they require quite a lot of pressing while applying and the application just irritates my acne a lot 😫 imma finish the ones I have but I have no intentions on buying anymore from any brands (even though the minimalist and earth rhythm ones look good 🤡)more reviews to come! ill be doing one on stuff my dad will be bringing from the U.S in the next few weeks so do let me know if you'd like a follow up on those too! (~~why do i treat my posts like a sitcom😭).~~  and as always, any other questions, comments are always welcomed and so are dms!\n\nbyeeee 💖💖",

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

Easy to spread texture for a natural, hydrated, shine-free finish leaving no white cast.\n\n*Fragrance free • Non-comedogenic • 50ml*  \nPrice- $499  \n \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Uvinul A Plus**\n\nThis Modern filter excels in protecting your skin from free radical and skin damage. Its Photostable nature provides continuous defence against the sun, while its excellent safety profile makes it perfect for all skin types, including the most sensitive. In the formula it not only promises potent UVA protection but also enhances the formula for broad-spectrum protection.\n\n**Tinosorb M**\n\nTinosorb M is an UV filter that revolutionises sun protection with its broad-spectrum coverage against both UVA and UVB rays, also provides even protection into visible (blue) light, Its dual-action mechanism not only absorbs but also scatters sunlight, offering unparalleled defence against the sun's harmful effects. Renowned for its photostability, it ensures long-lasting protection, maintaining its efficacy even under direct sunlight.\n\n**Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**\n\nIt stands out as a UVB filter that effectively shields your skin from the sun rays. It's popular for its ability to prevent sunburn and protect against UV-induced damage. This UV filter is prized for its lightweight feel making daily application enjoyable without the greasiness.\n\nWater/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Ethoxydiglycol, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Diisopropyl Adipate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Isododecane, Pentylene Glycol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Acrylates/Polytrimethylsiloxymethacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Xanthan Gum  \n\n\n**Review**  \nSkin Type: Combination (Oily in T-zone), acne-prone, currently a bit dry due to acne medication  \nWeather: Pleasant, not hot enough to test sweat resistance  \nAge 25-30  \nTexture: Super watery in texture, close to the new Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen.  \nApplication: for my skin, it blended easily, like a dream.  \nWhite Cast: My face is slightly darker than NC42 and most sunscreens leave a white cast including Minimalist SPF50. This left no white cast at all, I was pleasantly surprised.  \nWent out in the sun for an hour, no stinging/burning/tanning observed but that is too soon to judge.\n\nOverall: After application, it forms a slightly tight film which gives a glow to the face. I had slight barrier damage on my chin, it did not sting when I applied the sunscreen there but pilled after a while only in that area. I usually get sweaty on my nose post sunscreen application but that did not happen, it might be due to the pleasant weather. My skin feels slightly stretchy right now and lightly oily on my forehead  \nAM Routine today: Simple Moisturizing face wash-->.Cosrx propolis synergy toner-->Cosrx Vitamin C 23%-->Simple hydrating light moisturizer-->wait 5 minutes then sunscreen\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I think I will repurchase this, it has great lab and human testing results, the texture and application seems great for summers for my skin and this is the first sunscreen which truly has no white cast for me. The last sunscreen to do this was Aqualogica which tanned me. (I don't mind tanning but it proved that it did not protect my skin). \n\nObviously YMMV but I hope this works for you. Feel free to ask any questions.",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I’ve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or “glucoside”.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or “methosulfate” (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in “-imonium chloride”. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it’s an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt’s best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the “feeling” of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this “protein overload” is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair.

sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it’s wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

    "body": "Here are my thoughts on the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser & Kale-lalu-yaHa Exfoliant:\n\n\n**Cleanser:**\nThis cleanser doesn't have much of a scent which I love and contains some really awesome, skin loving ingredients. First, this contains matcha which is a potent antioxidant that helps protect the skin while hemp seed oil hydrates. Hemp seed oil is also high in linoleic acid and full of amino acids that heal, plump and protect the skin. Other ingredients include Vitamin B5 & Sodium PCA are skin strengthening ingredients that also help to hydrate. The cleansing agent in this formula is the coco-betaine, coco-glucoside & decyl glucoside which are a group of surfactants that are gentle at cleansing the skin without over-drying & protects the lipid barrier. I did pH test this and it tested about a 6.\n\nMy philosophy is that cleansing is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine. So, if you haven't guessed, I have tried my fair share of cleansers and I have to say, this cleanser is absolutely fantastic. This is a slightly foaming, gel cleanser that cleanses the skin thoroughly without stripping and leaves my skin incredibly soft and hydrated. It is also pretty concentrated, so you don't need to use very much. I am super impressed with the formulation and how well this works on my skin. I also love that this retails for $16 so it is extremely affordable. This has quickly replaced my former HG (holy grail) cleanser and I will keep repurchasing because it's just that good!\n\n\n\n**Kale-lalu-yaHa:**\nThis smells like a typical acid product, similar to Paula's Choice 2% BHA. This contains 5.25% glycolic acid as the exfoliating agent which is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) derived from sugar cane. AHA's are water soluble which means that they work on the surface of the skin. AHA's do not penetrate very deep into the skin and are best suited for removing dead skin cells that build up on the skin's surface. This also contains kale and other dark leafy greens which are potent antioxidants that are full of vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin B5, Allantoin and Aloe keep the skin hydrated and soothed. I did pH test this and it tested about a 4.5.\n\nSo the pH is around 4-4.5 which is a little high but can still exfoliate the skin. I personally think that this formula would be best suited for those with sensitive skin or those sensitive to acids. Also, this would be a great option for those just starting to get into using acids regularly. Since the pH is slightly high, this isn't going to be super strong, which I like because it doesn't cause any negative reaction on my sensitive skin. To use, I saturate a cotton pad and swipe my face, neck and upper chest and leave it on, no rinsing required. This does tingle which means it's working but dissipates quickly as it drys. Like the cleanser, this is very concentrated so a little goes a long way. After using this 3x per week for the past month, I can report that this is indeed a gentle exfoliating liquid that has kept my skin smooth, soft, a little more even toned and I have noticed by pores are less clogged. Although this isn't a BHA (an oil soluble exfoliant) that exfoliates the gunk that gets trapped inside the pores, keeping the surface clear of dead skin does help keep the pores from collecting that gunk in the first place. I hope that makes sense :) Again, this is a very gentle exfoliant and is a good intro for those new to chemical exfoliants. I would definitely repurchase!\n\nI do have a full blog post with more pictures [here](http://www.pdxbeautiful.com/2018/03/review-krave-beauty.html). ",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles. Bottle looks super tiny and the plastic waste bothers me.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Re'equil Anti-Hairfall Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:   [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-c14-16-olefin-sulfonate), [Cocamidopropyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-hydroxysultaine), [Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-cocoyl-isethionate), [Decyl Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/decyl-glucoside), [Coco-Glucoside](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/coco-glucoside), [Dexpanthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Glyceryl Oleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-oleate), [Biotin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/biotin), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Nasturtium Officinale Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/nasturtium-officinale-extract), [Tropaeolum Majus Extract](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tropaeolum-majus-extract), [Polyquaternium-22](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-22), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Glycol Monostearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycol-stearate), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Methylchloroisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylchloroisothiazolinone), [Methylisothiazolinone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylisothiazolinone), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Ci 45100](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-45100), [Ci 42090](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.450 for 250 ml. Max discount 30%.\n\nUsage Timeline: 2 months\n\nConsistency: It's a pink liquid. Normal shampoo consistency\n\nUsage:  I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: Oh my god, you guys. Best find of this year. This gives super shiny, sleek looking hair. I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above. Forever Repurchase. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Oriental Botanics Red Onion Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients: This has an ingredients list a mile long. Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

Was MRP 490 for 500 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years. I'm on my second tub\n\nConsistency: White cream.\n\nUsage: I take one big spoonful, add it to half a mug of water, swirl it around till it mixes with the water, dip my hair in and leave it. I'm not sure why this works since leaving hair in water isn't good, but it does. Between just straight up applying it and doing this, this works better. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far. I'm done with half the tub and I'm not looking forward to hunting a moisturising coditioner without protein once again.\n\nBottomline:  💔\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Plum Olive and Macadamia Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Brassica Campestris/​Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/brassica-campestris-aleurites-fordi-oil-copolymer), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetostearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrogenated-ethylhexyl-olivate), [Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrogenated-olive-oil-unsaponifiables), [Hydrolyzed Corn Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-corn-protein), [Hydrolyzed Soy Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-soy-protein), [Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Macadamia Integrifolia (Macadamia) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/macadamia-integrifolia-seed-oil), [Panthenyl Hydroxypropyl Steardimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenyl-hydroxypropyl-steardimonium-chloride), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [P-Methoxycinnamidopropyl Dimethyl Behenyl Ammonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/p-methoxycinnamidopropyl-dimethyl-behenyl-ammonium-chloride), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nPrice: MRP 675 for 250 ml. Plum has a 100 million sales throughout. You can get it for around 450ish.\n\nUsage Timeline: No clue. I'm on my third tub.\n\nConsistency: Thick white cream\n\nUsage: This works both ways. Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

This silicone can be washed off with cocoamidopropyl betaine Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Sodium lauroyl glutamate, Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate all of these can wash out the silicone and all of these are cg approved. \n\nSo, in theory and from a logical point of view, this could be a budget friendly conditioner suitable for curly hair! \n\nAlso if you've used this conditioner please share your experience!",

It's been a month now and OP, I can't thank you enough for your post. \n\nI have 2B curls with fine hair and it was damaged (bleaching, color, heat treatment 😭) before I started CGM. I started experimenting with combination of products over the last year and realised my hair needs medium level of conditioning and protein makes it very dry. So I stick to a normal routine of washing my hair with SebaMed Anti-dry shampoo(prescribed by my derm) and WOW Morrocan Argan Oil Conditioner. I use a few drops of Nature's Tattva Sweet Almond oil as my leave in and WOW aloe vera gel. This seemed to work for my hair but I still wasn't happy with my hair. \n\nSaw your post and thought of giving the pantene conditioner, Silky Smooth variant in Advanced haircare series a try. And OMG, IT IS CGM FRIENDLY. Still waited a month to be able to judge the conditioner and it works wonders without breaking the pocket. It doesn't have as much slip as a heavy condioner would have though, maybe the damage protection variant might, so I don't recommend it for extremely dry hair. I mainly use it to detangle and am planning to dilute it to use as a leave-in as well.",

    "body": "Yes, that’s right. Baby shampoo as a cleanser. This is probably one of the best, non-stripping foaming cleansers I’ve tried and it’s the cheapest cleanser I have.  I’ve been rotating this with my VaniCream Cleanser and I just want to be done with that so I can keep using this!\n\n**Name:** Pipette Baby Wash + Shampoo, Fragrance Free (https://pipettebaby.com/collections/bathing/products/shampoo-wash?variant=29620520616022)\n\n**Price:** $6-10 available in so many stores like Target, Ulta, Bed Bath & Beyond, Amazon, etc\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycerin, Coco-Glucoside, Glycolipids, Squalane, Citric Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Sodium Gluconate\n\n**What I Like About It:**\n- Large size: 11.8 fl. oz\n- Super affordable. When I bought mine, I got it for around $5. That turns out to be 43 cents per fl. oz\n- Easily available in so many stores. There’s always a store that has it on sale so it’s easy to pick it up for $6-7.\n- Simple, non-stripping ingredients that keeps the face hydrated, but is still able to remove sunscreen and make up. Sometimes, I don’t even bother double cleansing if my make up and sunscreen aren’t too resistant.\n- Cruelty free and vegan\n\nI honestly don’t have anything bad to say about this product. I was hesitant to make this review because I wanted to keep it on the DL haha! But, it’s so good! I’m glad I tried it based on a recommendation here. Never going back to regular cleansers. If it doesn’t work for you, you’re not out much at all.",

I have had very good experience with these ingredients before for calming my skin, but sadly this product did not work as expected. \n• I now use this when my skin is fine, to remove sunscreen as a first cleanse and it works well for that purpose.\n* **Repurchase Status:**WNRP\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n* **Product Name:** the dermaco AHA BHA foaming cleanser\n* *Review Type:** reject\n* **Price (range):** INR 349/100ML.

    "body": "Since I've been having a hard time finding reviews for foreign products (I'm in the USA) I thought I would review one and possibly help someone else out! This review is for [Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-cleanance-sun-care-spf-50-50ml/22947.html) I purchased this from Cocooncenter, a website that ships European products to loads of different countries!\n\n**My skin for reference:**\n\nExtremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, not particularly acne-prone. My morning routine while trying this was just CeraVe foaming cleanser, Cosrx Centella toner, and this sunscreen.\n\n**Product name:** \n\nAvène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ (50ml) - $13.62 USD before shipping from Cocooncenter.\n\n**Product type:** \n\nDaily use sunscreen\n\n**Product description:** \n\ntaken directly from the website - \"Avène Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ is a cream of very high protection specially formulated for oily to acne prone skin exposed to intense sunlight. This cream contains a photo-protective active complex which insure a high protection against all of the solar radiation UVB and UVA long and short. It also contains a powerful antioxidant, as well as monolaurin which allows to matify the skin thanks to its seboregulator action. Its light and fluid texture protects, moisturizes, and matifies the skin without leaving any white effect after its application.\"\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThis sunscreen is advertised as silicone and paraben free, and it also happens to be free of alcohol, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and most other American filters (contains avobenzone). This sunscreen would be considered reef safe to Hawaii's standards. Its filters are Tinosorbs M & S, Uvasorb HEB, and Avobenzone.\n\nAvene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Methylene Bis-Benzatriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol [Nano], Cetearyl Isononanoate Water (Aqua), Disopropyl Adipate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Laurate Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzoic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Behenate, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Glycerides, Propylène Glycol, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl, Glucoside, Tribehennin, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate. \n\n**My opinion:** \n\nI wore this sunscreen for about a month before quitting (about three weeks ago). This sunscreen is quite matte. Definitely the most matte alcohol-free sunscreen I've ever tried. It is a thin lotion, but because of the high concentration of Tinosorbs it is slightly sticky and doesn't rub in very well. Once it dries, the stickiness is greatly reduced. It is a matte upon application, and stays matte for a few hours, but it is not \"mattifying\" in that it doesn't prevent my oil from shining through the sunscreen later in the day. I get greasy eventually, but it is still much better than any other sunscreen.\n\nIt leaves a slight white cast, mainly in streaks where I couldn't completely rub it in. After it completely dries, the white cast is mostly gone. It just stays white in patches around my nose and near my hairline. For reference, I am extremely pale, lighter-than-the-lightest-shade-of-foundation pale, so it would definitely show up white on anyone dark.\n\nThe sunscreen is very fragranced, and I can smell it all day long unless I apply makeup over it. It definitely irritates my senses and makes my skin itch when first applied. If you are sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this sunscreen. It didn't break me out, and is advertised for acne skin, so I can assume it will be safe for people who are acne prone. I ended up quitting on this sunscreen because I was too sensitive to the fragrance and couldn't wear it out of the house without foundation to hide the streaks.\n\n**Overall Rating:**\n\nI would rate this sunscreen 6.5/10 - it is matte, which I like, and it is free of alcohol/octinoxate/oxybenzone etc., which are big plusses. The cons, that kinda outweigh the pros, are that it is fragranced, slightly streaky, and difficult to rub in. I would not repurchase this sunscreen, it is just too expensive to ship for a very small/mediocre product. \n\n**Additional mini-review: Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick**\n\nThis SPF lip balm is AMAZING. Definitely the best lip balm I've tried with sun protection included. It uses the Tinosorbs and Avobenzone as filters. It has no nasty sunscreen taste, no weird texture. It's high protection to keep your lips safe from UVA. The only cons I have are that it's quite matte, and I prefer shiny lip balms. You could easily apply lip color on top of it for a day out. It also contains fragrance, but I don't notice it whatsoever. I give this a 9.5/10.\n\n[Avène Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick - $6.33 USD / 3g](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-sun-care-lip-spf-30-lip-stick-3g/12848.html) - Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (Ricinys Communis Seed Oil), C 12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dipentaerythrityl Tetrahydroxystearate/Tetraisostearate, Ozokerite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Myristyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Esters, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Bis Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax (Cera Carnauba), VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Octocrylene, Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), BHT, Decyl Glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol, Silica, Titanium Dioxyde, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Aqua, Xanthan Gum.\n\n**Overall, I feel that if you have oily, acne-prone skin that is not sensitive to fragrance and can handle a slight white cast, you could like this sunscreen. Most people would like the lip balm!**\n\nEdit: added some info",

    "body": "Hey everyone -- there's a lot of detail below, but it's organized as favorite to least favorite. And [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)'s a link to my last post, where I speak to some of the products that I skip mentioning here.\n\n**Product reviews**\n\n* **iS Clinical Active Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is my HG exfoliant. It's the perfect strength for my skin. p50 was perfect before I started using retinoids (although I never tried the lower strengths), but this formula is the perfect formula to purify my oily T-zone while not causing irritation on dry-tending cheeks.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* Either in the AM or PM, every other day (alternating with a retinoid). I use 5 drops on face and neck, applied with my hands on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of common suspects: glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol denat., phenoxyethanol. None of these are terrible worth going into, although super sensitive folks may have trouble with the alcohol denat.\n      * Arbutin: skin-lightening ingredient that [works differently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8632348/) than Vit C or licorice, so their effects can be complementary.\n      * Salix Alba (willow) bark extract: natural source of salicylic acid.\n      * Saccharum Officinarum Extract: natural source of glycolic acid.\n      * Bilberry extract: blueberry-like fruit with soothing and anti-aging properties. It's a [strong antioxidant](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vaccinium-myrtillus-fruit-extract.html) due to the anthocyanins in the fruit (which give the skin its dark blue color).\n      * Polyporus Umbellatus Extract: source of kojic acid, which has skin brightening properties. It is also antimicrobial, according to the iS Clinical [website](https://isclinical.com/ingredient/view/index/id/5778).\n      * Menthol: this one is controversial. It's listed as an irritant, and I certainly don't want to dispute that. I also know that menthol is used in a wide variety of formulas (e.g., IcyHot), so I think it's worth trying and maybe backing off if you have trouble. \n* **Tata Harper Superkind Softening Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* It feels like washing your face with floral honey, and it really does calm the skin. A 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 125mL\n   * *How I use it:* Everyday once (try to minimize since it's pricey). In the shower and rinse. Sometimes on dry skin.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * A powerful suite of emollients (which I'm OK with as an oily-combo skin type since it's a cream cleanser): evening primrose oil, apple seed oil, castor oil, jojoba seed oil, squalane, grape seed oil, and sunflower oil. Note these are all mid-low comedogenicity.\n      * Lactic acid serves as a very gentle exfoliant, although % is not listed.\n      * Olivem 1000, which is a combo of ingredients used to emulsify the formula. However, Olivem 1000 puts the products into a liquid crystal structure, which is supposed to absorb into the skin with increased efficacy. *To look for Olivem 1000 in a product, look for Sorbitan Olivate and Cetearyl Olivate.*\n      * Soothers in this formula are abundant (hence \"Superkind\"): prickly pear, calendula (#1 ingredient), and chamomile are the stars.\n      * Magnolia extract is another ingredient worth mentioning in this formula: it's a popular addition [for Nivea](https://www.nivea.com.au/advice/skin/magnolia-extract) as well. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and softening effects.\n      * There are a number of natural surfactants (it is a cleanser after all): decyl glucoside, and shea butter glycerides as the primary ones.\n      * As for all of Tata Harper's products (that I know of): there is fragrance. If you're super sensitive, proceed with caution.\n* **Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix and is loaded with natural goodies in classic Tata fashion. It works well with the resurfacing mask, and is an effective formula for increased shine and deeper subsequent product penetration.\n   * *Cost:* $88 for 120mL\n   * *How I use it:* Twice a week, once with the resurfacing mask (see below for details).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * This is a physical/chemical exfoliant mix: physical exfoliants include kaolin clay, apricot seed powder, and rice extract. These are quite small and I have found to be pleasant as a compounding abrasive agent. For chemical exfoliants, we have Salix Alba extract and pomegranate enzyme.\n      * Some more under the radar ingredients: Olivem 1000, radish root extract, superoxide dismutase, which is an effective antioxidant for protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS). \n      * Aloe juice is near the top of the list and is soothing (as we know).\n      * Plenty of other good emollients in this formula as well (sunflower seed oil, olive oil). \n      * Lots of powerful fruit extracts in here, too (classic Tata): elderberry extract, alfalfa, and meadowsweet are the major ones. These are mostly antioxidant and antimicrobial actors in the formula.\n      * There are a few potential irritants in this formula, so maybe try the small size first to see if it agrees with your skin.\n* **Obagi Professional-C Serum 10% 5/5** There are only 5 ingredients in this formula, with AA as one of them. It's a good alternative for me vs. SC CE Ferulic since it's less comedogenic. It will oxidize quickly (as I've heard) so I usually keep this in the fridge. Retro-fitting a pump (vs. dropper) is a good idea, too. It smells good, too. It's $94 for 1oz. I use it after cleansing in the AM.\n* **EltaMD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46 5/5** Enough has been written about this brand and formula, so I'm not going to dive deep here. That said, it's physical/chemical and broad spectrum, has niacinamide, lactic acid, and is oil-free. It's a great option for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The tint was too obvious for my skin, so I prefer the clear version.\n* **Tata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* If you have very oily skin, I would maybe avoid this formula. There are a number of somewhat comedogenic oils, but it may still be worth a try as comedogenicity is not always 1:1. It's a gorgeous formula and truly unique. My skin is oily-combo, and it works (and smells) like a charm. 100% RP.\n   * *Cost:* $130 for 1.7 fl oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I absolutely love this moisturizer. I use it everyday during my morning routine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Same idea as the mask. I can't speak to everything in this…you'd have to be a cosmetic botanist to do that…\n      * A number of interesting oils in this formula which tend to not be comedogenic: sandalwood oil, squalane, apple seed oil, evening primrose oil, sea buckthorn oil. Sandalwood oil is high in Ximenynic acid, [which is a potent anti-inflammatory agent](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/Detail/1777/556915/Pure-Australian-Sandalwood-Seed-Oil). Evening primrose has a lot of [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects as well](https://www.byrdie.com/evening-primrose-oil-for-skin-5215964), although it falls in the middle of the comedogenicity rating. Sea Buckthorn oil is also an-\"it\" oil recently. It's also high in antioxidants incl. vit C., regulates sebum production, has antimicrobial properties, and obviously moisturizes ([source](https://www.byrdie.com/sea-buckthorn-oil-5210082)). Since this is a formula for blemish-prone skin, the formula is sebum-conscious. That said, if you have very oily skin, I would test before committing to the full bottle.\n      * Lots of soothing agents in here: Aloe, calendula, lactobacillus ferment, arnica, multiple types of HA, tremella extract (mushroom with outstanding humectant properties).\n      * The antioxidants in this formula are powerful (including the oils mentioned above): borage leaf extract, Tasmanian pepper extract, fermented bamboo, sea fern extract. \n      * As far as anti-acne agents, Zinc + Salix Alba bark extract are the main factors. \n      * There's also Alpha-Glucan oligosaccharide, which is [supposed to be](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/eu/PersonalCare/Detail/2510/74697/BioEcolia) beneficial for the skin microbiome.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Gel:** **5/5**\n   * *Summary:* So this serum is a go-to for me as someone with combination skin that tends toward redness. A 100% RP. 5/5.\n   * *Cost:* $78 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* The serum is something I put up to augment any active I use, and I love it for that reason. It’s hydrating, calming, and smells good, and it ultimately is the most frequently used product in my routine. \n   * *Ingredients:* There are a number of interesting ingredients in this formula: \n      * Olea Europaea Leaf Extract is olive leaf extract, and it’s shown some promise in [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32333467/) study (although it’s a small group, not double blind or randomized, and technically doesn’t meet statistical significance thresholds). That said, PC has [great things to say](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-olea-europaea-leaf-extract.html). Major benefits are improvement in skin texture, some photoprotection, and antioxidant properties (high in catechin and rutin, both bioflavonoids). \n      * There’s also cucumber fruit extract, which has moisturizing (no surprise, it’s 95% water), antioxidant (some Ascorbic Acid, some flavonoids), and conditioning properties. Cucumber is one of the rare instances of a non-sensitizing fragrance. \n      * This formula also has grapefruit extract and thyme extract — consensus from outside SkinCeuticals seems light to mid on both of these. \n      * The formula has a small amount of Morus Bombycis Root Extract, which is derived from mulberry and has arbutin in it, which as we know is good for skin lightening as it’s a hydroquinone derivative. \n      * There are a few icks in this formula (fragrance, linalool, etc.), but overall I have found it to be very calming and pleasant. \n* **Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Sleepair Intensive Mask 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a thick, non-comedogenic formula with intense soothing effects. It will likely pill, but it's intended for night use, so that shouldn't be an issue. I prefer this to the SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque. Will RP.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 110mL\n   * *How I use it:* I only use this for irritated skin, which it promptly resolves over night.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * As far as moisturizing factors, this product has over ten humectants: propanediol, glycerin, trehalose being the highest on the ingredient list\n      * There are a smaller number of emollients: only true oil being moringa seed oil, which is far down the ingredient list. Point being: *this product is thick but has not been comedogenic in my experience.*\n      * The real power of this product is in the soothing ingredients it offers: gotu kola (cica) being the featured #1. Gotu Kola contains a number of active compounds, including madecassoside, which has been shown to work as a [wound-healing agent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18503551/), an [anti-hyperpigmentation agent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6290557/), and a soothing ingredient [potentially effective](https://www.seppic.com/en/clean-moisture-lotion-as40140a) for atopic dermatitis (eczema). There are more soothing agents in this formula—without listing them all, suffice it say that Dr. Jart+'s chemists know what they're doing.\n      * There is also Niacinamide, Curcumin extract, Adenosine, Cacao seed extract, and other antioxidant ingredients for a nourishing blend.\n* **CeraVe SA Cream for Rough and Bumpy Skin 5/5** \n   * Summary: It's a standard (not lux) product which is effective for KP. It works.\n   * Cost:\n   * How I use it: I use it on the body (esp. on the thighs). 2x/day.\n   * Ingredients:\n      * It's a thick formula (lots of ceramides, corn oil, paraffin, mineral oil, cholesterol), but it's interestingly not comedogenic (also because it's indicated for body use vs. face). \n      * In terms of actives, we have lactate, vit E, salicylic acid, niacinamide, and phytosphingosine.\n* **SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum 5/5**\n   * *Summary:* A multi-tasking superformula with growth factors derived from human fibroblasts. It's very expensive, and it's something that I don't think I will repurchase (not because it doesn't work) but because anti-aging isn't my #1 priority. While my skin is young, I'm focused on anti-acne and hyperpigmentation, but for folks who want to improve collagen and elastin production, this is it.\n   * *Cost:* $295 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* After microneedling at home, once or twice a week. \n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * TNS (total nutrient system): this is a medium that is harvested from propagated human fibroblasts. This medium is rich in nutrients and signaling compounds that trigger collagen and elastin production.\n      * Lots of other goodies: peptide complexes such as whey, lactococcus ferment, algae extract, usual suspects for humectants, fruit extracts such as apple and grape, pullulan, lecithin (for creating liposomes which deliver actives deeper into the skin).\n* **SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel: 5/5 — with caution**\n   * *Summary:* This is a strong cleanser and should only be used for folks with oily skin. It has a cooling effect, which is pleasant, but the combination of actives in this is no joke. If you have really congested, clogged pores, I would recommend it. It's cheap enough, and strong enough, that I only need a bit and can use it as a semi-regular purge. It's an RP for me.\n   * *Cost:* $42 for 240mL\n   * *How I use it:* I usually only use it in my T-zone, leave it on for no more than 3 minutes and rinse.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Sodium Laureth Sulfate: Chief Bubble Officer. [Less irritating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12641575/) than Sodium *Lauryl* Sulfate.\n      * Glycolic acid: most researched and effective AHA. We know this sloughs off the top layer of dead skin cells. \n      * Salicylic acid (SA): an HG for acne treatment. Is lipid soluble so it can penetrate more deeply into the sebaceous gland and provide a better decongesting effect. This is in addition to exfoliating properties acting at the skin surface (although inferior to glycolic in that respect).\n      * Capryolyl Salicylic acid (LHA): this is a compound developed by L'Oreal to be a more lipophilic version of SA, providing better penetration. The study is from 2007 and 100% sponsored by L'Oreal but you can read it [here](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(06)03022-2/fulltext) if you're interested. There is some hubbub about pregnancy safety; do your own research on that front if that's applicable to you.\n      * Menthol: provides a nice cooling but can be sensitizing. [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-menthol.html) is pretty adamant against it, but I don't really give it too much stead. They cite pretty old research. I don't think my skin has been sensitized from it. There is [some newer evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8620938/) of it promoting wound healing.\n      * [Sorbitol](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-sorbitol.html): A sugar substitute that acts as a humectant. Interestingly, it can also act as a prebiotic. Certain bacteria on your skin can convert sorbitol into beta-glucan, which calms the skin. Beta-glucan is partially responsible for the calming effect of oats and seaweed\n* **PCA Clearskin Lightweight Moisturizer:** **4/5**\n   * *Summary:* Overall, I find this product to be hydrating and non-offensive. To be honest, I don't know that it surpasses my OG in this category (non-comedogenic moisturizer) which is Neutrogena HydroBoost Water Gel. Although, if you need something more emollient than that, this is a very good option.\n   * *Cost:* $57 for 1.7oz\n   * *How I use it:* This is a good option for night time for those with oily skin. It might be too thick to put under an occlusive sunscreen during the day esp. if you run oily. Otherwise, daytime fine, too.\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * Ethylhexyl Isononanoate (say that 5 times fast) is the primary emollient here, and to be honest I can’t find much in the way of research on this compound. That said, I really trust PCA because your ingredients must really be top notch if you’re going to have the most bland packaging known to man. Murad and EltaMD also seem to be fans of it, which is a good sign. There are a number of other emollients, preservatives, and viscosity controlling agents which are probably not worth mentioning (they're pretty inert as far as those go). \n      * Borage seed oil has a comedogenicity rating of 2 (out of 5, 5 being instant pimple) and is very high in GLA (gamma linolenic acid) which [PC](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-gamma-linolenic-acid-gla.html) considers to be a \"best\" rating. There is some good consensus that it has skin regulating properties (eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, etc.). \n      * Other calming ingredients: aloe, calendula, cucumber, chamomile (bisabolol). Has glycerin as well (although not too much). \n      * There is retinyl palmitate, which is a bit confusing to me, to be honest. If you're making a moisturizer for oily skin, I don't know why you would include one of the least active forms of vitamin A. \n* **SkinMedica HA5 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I think this is probably a miracle product if you have deep wrinkles. The five different types of HA are going to sit on various levels of the dermis, provide different hydration profiles, and sustain moisture in different ways. For me, as a younger person without deep wrinkles, it's nice but not worth the $ for me right now.\n   * *Cost:* $184 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Usually replaces a proper (?) moisturizer during daytime for me and put sunscreen on over.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * 5 types of HA. I'm not going to go through them, but there is crosslinked (bigger HA, which sits on top of skin cuz there's no way it's penetrating any deeper), hydrolyzed (smaller version but SkinMedica doesn't give the weight so hard to say exactly where it's going to land in the skin), plus the regular HA. I actually see 3 obvious HAs in the ingredients, not 5. Someone help.\n      * Texturizing compounds (HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Cross-p, polymethylsilsesquioxane) which give it a really nice slip feel\n      * Pullulan (mentioned this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/)) but this is the compound that tightens the skin and is used to create the Listerine sheets.\n      * Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape seed), which [PC loves](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-vitis-vinifera-grape-seed-extract.html). It's antioxidant containing and many of them at that (resveratrol, anthocyanins, flavonoids, etc.)\n      * Vibrio alginolyticus ferment filtrate: This is actually a pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium, but this is obviously not a live form of it. Hard to find a lot of info on it, but[ it seems like](https://trulux.com.au/products/vibrio-alginolyticus-ferment-filtrate#:~:text=Vibrio%20Alginolyticus%20Ferment%20Filtrate)%20organizes,exopolysaccharide%20synthesized%20by%20kopara%20microorganisms.) it claims to be helpful in epidermal organization. \n      * Porphyridium cruentum extract which is a red algae derivative that has zeaxanthin, which is in the vitamin A family and has photoprotective properties. Jury seems to be out on efficacy.\n      * Moisturizing factors: Serine, Urea, Trehalose. Urea is interesting because it does have a function in rejuvenation (by breaking down a protein called filaggrin which helps organize the keratin in the skin at the top layer). This is thought to free up amino acids in the ECM.\n      * Skin communication ingredients: Whey protein, Plankton extract\n* **Tata Harper Repairative Moisturizer 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's not for me since my skin is oily, but it's a fab product if you're OK with emollients and fragrance (very well harvested and preserved via pump).\n   * *Cost:* \n   * *How I use it:* Since my skin is oily/combo, I don't often use this to be honest. This would be perfect for daily use for dry skin types or those that can get away with a product that gives some more shine.\n   * *Ingredients:* Simply too many to list. Check them out [here](https://incidecoder.com/products/tata-harper-repairative-moisturiser). \n* **SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream: 4/5** Also not going to go super in depth here. TNS is the same as mentioned above, but this formula is a lot cheaper and has a much more emollient feel. I only use it post-procedure. Will RP when I have another procedure (esp. microneedling or Morpheus).\n* **SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic: 4/5** Not going to say a whole lot here. But I did figure out that the Vit E in this way causing some closed comedones, so I had to stop using it on the face. Won't be RP for that reason.\n* **First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream: 4/5** Want to revise the record and say that I do believe this broke me out a few times on the face. Great for dry areas on the body, eczema, or post-procedure. Not great for face if oily.\n* **SkinCeuticals AGE Eye Complex:** **4/5 since I am 26 and advanced glycation end products probably not a huge issue for me**\n   * *Summary:* I wrote a review of this in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/102f0zu/i_spent_2k_on_skincare_so_you_dont_have_to/), and I don’t think much has changed, although I do think that I can effectively minimize any irritation from this product with applying a small amount. I’ve taken a deeper dive into some of the ingredients. \n   * *How I use it:* Just a little bit below the eyes in the morning\n   * *Cost:* $105 for 15mL\n   * *Ingredients:* \n      * First off, like 7/10 first ingredients are about viscosity and skin-feel and that definitely comes through when you apply the product. It’s hard in the jar but slips on the face very nicely. This is also good for ensuring it lasts a long time. \n      * There are also a number of compounds that scatter light such as Nylon-12, reducing the appearance of fine lines. \n      * It also obviously features Pro-Xylane (thanks L’Oreal). I tried to find some independent research on this (and [this](https://www.wcd2019milan-dl.org/abstract-book/documents/late-breaking-abstracts/45-wound-healing/proxylane-a-plant-sugar-derivative-9.pdf) is the closest I could find). Basically L’Oreal claims that it helps restore the ECM (extracellular matrix, which is where collagen, elastin, and many of the other things responsible for skin appearance lie). \n      * We also have Ascorbyl Glucoside (AG) in this formula, which makes sense regarding skin firmness and lightening. Jury is still out on in-vivo skin penetration of AG but it does create a reservoir of Vit C in the skin because it takes time for it to be converted into ascorbic acid (AA). \n      * There is caffeine in this formula as well, which we know is an antioxidant and helps with circulation.\n      * There is some UV protection from titanium dioxide. \n      * There’s also Hesperdin Methyl Chalcone which is derived from citrus and has blood vessel protecting properties. It’s at minimum an antioxidant and at maximum can help reduce dark circles due to its effect on vasculature. \n      * There’s anthocyanins in the form of bilberry extract but it’s far down on the ingredients so who knows how impactful that is. \n      * There are also a number of peptides in this formula which should help contribute to a firming effect. \n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Mask 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a cult favorite from an iconic brand in the Green Beauty space. \n   * *Cost:* $68 for 1oz.\n   * *How I use it:* I use this once a week with the Regenerating Cleanser ([as Tata suggests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrVxpoG_Nw)), which I use on dry skin and then layer with this mask. Leave on for 5 minutes, rinse, and my face feels great.\n   * *Ingredients:* If I had to write a complete summary of ingredients for all of her products, we'd be here all day & I would hit the word limit. So I'm going for an abridged approach.\n      * The primary active in this product is Salix Alba Bark Extract (willow bark) which is a natural BHA source. \n      * Despite being a resurfacing mask, there are a number of effective soothing complexes in this formula, namely 2 types of aloe. You could argue that Beet Root is a soother as well, although it's primarily a source of antioxidants and functions as a humectant.\n      * There is lactobacillus ferment, which Estee Lauder introduced in 2009 as a DNA repair enzyme and an antioxidant. There's also pomegranate enzyme which is extract using lactobacillus, although this functions more as an exfoliant.\n      * Radish Root Extract, which you'll find in Dr. Barbara Strum products + some (all?) versions of p50. This works both as a preservative in the formula but also as an antimicrobial on the skin.\n      * Kaolin clay — a gentler alternative to Bentonite which work as a mild abrasive and oil-wicking agent.\n      * Note there are a number of irritants in this product, so if you're sensitive to fragrance, be cautious.\n* **Maya Chia The Straight A Gentle Retinol Treatment 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I used this for 2 weeks. For the first week, my skin had a glow like no other. For the second week, I broke out. It's comedogenic for folks with more oily-type skin.\n   * *Cost:* $125 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night, after cleansing and a serum (optional).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of strong emollients which are plant derived and serve double duty as antioxidants as well: Chia seed oil, Rose hip oil, Raspberry seed oil, Buriti oil, Sunflower seed oil, Vitamin E\n      * Encapsulated retinol optimizes the retinol delivery system into the skin, and keeps it fresh for longer\n      * Natural retinol alternatives: Moth bean extract and bakuchiol which promote cell turnover (retinol's main mechanism of action)\n      * Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (THDA) is a form of vit C which has [shown promise](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrahexyldecyl-ascorbate) but is less proven than straight up AA. \n* **Neocutis Lumiere Firm Eye Cream 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* I really like this eye cream and I might RP. I love the pump, and I love the packaging. It does make a difference and my sensitive eyes tolerate it well. I wonder if it has been slightly too thick for my oily skin even though the eyes and cheeks run drier.\n   * *Cost:* $108 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* In eye area (not above) once a day, very small amount gently rubbed in\n   * *Ingredients:* Not going to go into too much detail here: it has caffeine, vit C (as THDA, AA, and ascorbyl palmitate), beech tree bud extract, lecithin, HA, licorice extract for brightening, peptides, growth factors, and chamomile. It's a multi-pronged formula with a lot of promise and gentle but effective actives.\n* **Consonant Hydrextreme 4/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is an excellent humectant product. It's very simple. I will not be RPing at this time because it's a bit too simple for me + feels like it doesn't go as far as some of the other options in this space.\n   * *Cost:* $112 for 30mL\n   * *How I use it:* After actives, before moisturizer, with wet hands.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Glycerin: it's probably the least offensive and most popular humectant. You probably already know it :). This is a high concentration formula that is not tacky or sticky.\n      * Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide: this is a plant sugar with emollient properties and is a good source of antioxidants ([source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/ingredient-cassia-angustifolia-seed-polysaccharide.html)).\n* **Aveeno Tone and Texture Renewing Night Cream 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's a good product. The PHA exfoliant is not quite strong enough for my KP so I will not be RPing, but it's a good choice if you have more sensitive skin on the body.\n   * *Cost:* $10 for 8oz on Amazon\n   * *How I use it:* On the body, roughly twice a week.\n   * *Ingredients:* I love the way that Aveeno breaks down the ingredients so see [here](https://www.aveeno.com/products/tone-texture-gentle-renewing-night-cream) if you're curious.\n* **Tata Harper Body Revitalizing Oil 3/5** Not going to do a deep dive here. The ingredients are quality, but it's too small of an amount for the price (considering that it goes on the body so you need much more).\n* **Tata Harper Resurfacing Body Serum 3/5** Same thing here. It's a fabulous formula but it's way too expensive for how much you'd need to use on the body. The bottle might give you 15 uses on the full body, which is just hard to justify.\n* **SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque: 3/5**\n   * *Summary:* This is a calming masque and SC claims it decreases your skin surface temperature by something like 5 degrees (ok). It's been sitting almost full in my cabinet for a while — it's nice but won't RP unless it's for post-procedure for something majorly irritating (phenol peel?).\n   * *Cost:* $66 for 60mL\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never lol. Would be great for post procedure.\n   * *Ingredients:* There is not a whole lot of extra detail to add here as compared with the gel described above. There are a few additional ingredients that are worth mentioning: Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester is a dipeptide that has skin calming and fibroblast protecting properties (PC agrees but [here's](https://www.activepeptide.com/product/acetyl-dipeptide-1-cetyl-ester/) the link to buy it raw if you want to experiment yourself yikes).\n* **SkinMedica AHA/BHA Cream 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It is confused about what it is and who it's for. I don't understand why there's so much more bilberry extract than exfoliants. I understand that these can be irritating products, but it feels like SM is putting the cart before the horse here. It should exfoliate first and foremost, and for me, it doesn't. No RP.\n   * *Cost:* $48 for 2oz\n   * *How I use it:* Almost never. It's probably fine to use morning and night, but depends on your face + wear SPF always but esp. in the AM if using AHAs.\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Lots of Bilberry extract (2nd ingredient)\n      * Moisturizing/calming: Aloe, Glycerin, Squalane, Chamomile (2 types), B5\n      * Natural AHAs: Sugar Cane Extract, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Extract. To me, these are not astringent enough to be effective. Perhaps it's the rest of the moisturizer and emollience of the rest of the formula, but I just don't feel that this sloughs off the dead skin in the way that I want it to.\n      * There's also BHA (Salicylic acid), Vit E, and Vit C (as ascorbyl palmitate). Like I said — confused.\n* **Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay 2/5** Not going to go in depth here. I don't think I'll ever \\*have\\* to RP (since it's huge), but I don't think I would. It's very good for removing sebaceous filaments and pulling oil from the skin. It's a bit strong, but it's a good option if you struggle with oil control.\n* **Avene Eau Thermale 2/5**\n   * *Summary:* It's just water. \n   * *Cost:* $20\n   * *How I use it:* On my face\n   * *Ingredients:* Mineral water. Be careful — it's pH 7.5. If you put this on immediately after any actives that require a narrow pH range (e.g., AA, AHAs/BHAs), you are going to inactivate them. \n* **Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask: 1/5** Not going to go in depth here. Will not RP. It works but so does Aquaphor.\n* **Darphin Intral Inner Youth Serum 1/5**\n   * *Summary:* No change noticed during 2 months of use. Fragrance is a bit sickly-sweet. Will not RP.\n   * *Cost:* $50 for 15mL\n   * *How I use it:* At night after an irritating product (retinoid or exfoliant).\n   * *Ingredients:*\n      * Chief function of the serum is soothing: it has panthenol, chamomile, and Alteromonas ferment (which is used across the cosmetics industry as a soothing agent).\n      * There is moisturizing action here, too: glycerin, glycosaminoglycans, castor oil (low comedogenicity). This is obvious from the serum nature of the formula, but it's certain not a moisturizer in and of itself.\n      * Peony extract is one of the chief ingredients and scents. Cannot find anything about the benefits of this.\n\nIn the queue next for me: is Clinical Cleansing Complex, Herbivore's Nova and Bakuchiol, Chebula Serum by True Botanicals, SkinCeuticals Retexturing Activator, Glytone Brightening Cleansing Powder, and UltraCeuticals Vitamin A serum, Vivier V-Stat Scar Gel — any experiences or thoughts are welcome!!",

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it.

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

You note the dry-touch finish - which is great - but does it leave any or much shine?\n\nIt's worth noting that the Face SPF30 version has a 5 star (Boots?) UVA rating so the PPA / PPD factor should be around 27.. which is higher than most SPF50s, I'm sure!

Ik heb álles geprobeerd wat ik kon vinden en heb mij laten testen bij de dermatoloog. Ik ben mij nu al ruim een maand lang beu aan het zoeken en ik kan simpelweg geen goede verzorgingsproducten zonder dit vinden! Ik krijg zeeën van onzin als ik probeer te zoeken naar producten zonder kokosschuimmiddelen. En het helpt ook niet dat veel websites gewoonweg geen ingrediënten neerzetten voor hun producten. Dus ik vroeg mij af of er hier iemand is die wél wat middeltjes kent.\n\nIk ben op zoek naar:\n\n* Vloeibare handzeep (het liefst mild i.v.m. eczeem)\n* Zeep voor huid onder de douche\n* Shampoo (haartype is droog, fijn, golvend, lage porositeit, niet geverfd of gebleekt)\n* Conditioners\n\nTandpasta heb ik godzijdank wel kunnen vinden (lang leve Oral-B!) Zeepblokken werken goed totdat ik deze ergens naartoe moet nemen waar kokosschuimmiddelen gebruikt worden. Dan breekt de eczeem op mijn handen weer los ivm kruisbesmetting, zelfs door kleine hoeveelheden restanten in de omgeving. En om nou iedereen die ik ken te vragen om over te stappen naar producten waar ík allergisch voor ben, vind ik nogal ver gaan.\n\nAlle hulp wordt zeer gewaardeerd!\n\nWat bekende kokosschuimmiddelen zijn:\n\n* Cocamidopropyl betaine (a.k.a. Tegobetaine L7, CAPB, Cocoyl amide propyldimethyl glycine, Coconut oil amidopropyl betaine, N-cocamidopropyl-N,N-dimethylglycine hydroxide inner salt)\n* Coco glucoside\n* Coco betaine\n* Cocamide DEA\n* Decyl glucoside\n* Cocamido sulfosuccinaat\n* Cocoamphoacetate",

Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

I was using these and testing them out while I was writing my previous sunscreen post , so I couldn't include these back then heheh. enjoy and I hope this helps you out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/un9cxl/shelfie_sunscreens_more_info/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**preliminary info**\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvluy9fctp691.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3dc4f6ac986e712bf9b297f7f11882f59c62e78\n\n* **The Derma Co.**  **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum**  \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfsq89eetp691.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d6b8bae83040943583a5eb4b1167f006397a41\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gneguawetp691.jpg?width=2693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=310db1edebf494a6ddcbc27c6d5bd31261b1ee84\n\n**ingredient list** :  Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lmry60ntp691.jpg?width=2284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ba8e26163d69608b5908427942392e037340cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k16vk0tntp691.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5842c13a2344fb14bbe8cb6275e1b6355354b19\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :( but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nrating : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uglx4tvptp691.jpg?width=3027&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1edc1b4cadce02af8a7cdc6b1c061b01ce3df5ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjk70mlqtp691.jpg?width=3234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9624dd3003686cc5cf39097b7f271e1643502dd5\n\n**ingredients list** :  Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure!  in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh. I feel like this one is getting over sooner than others in my ss ki theli 😫 but either way, if you find a good deal on it, blindly add this to your cart and order it. you wont be dissappointed!\n\nrating : 5/5 and WRP on reduced mrp only.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand that's all I have to share with you all today! there are so many other ss I want to try like the BOJ one and the Beplain nonnano one, but I want to finish my current stock before buying anymore! do feel free to ask any questions related in the comments and I hope you enjoyed reading these!",

But the biggest drawback is it’s whitecast :/ and I totally get you when you mention the white cast around mouth. The Neutrogena one makes me looking like a ghost all day.",

I've never had a huge dry skin issue on my face (everywhere else is frikking reptilian) so I haven't given it a huge thought.

Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d’abeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for £17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

However, every time I would use the cream it would aggravate and break me out. But, it worked WONDERS on dry patches on my feet and elbow. So I think this would be good for very very dry skin.

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

    "body": "This is such a simple, no-nonsense, multipurpose product. It is an accidental find but has found a permanent place in my skincare/haircare drawer. The product does not have a strong fragrance which does not linger after washing. The cost effectiveness is mind blowing for its uses. I got the 100ml bottle for 85/- but definitely going to invest in the 500ml henceforth. \n\nComing to its uses : \n\nSkincare - \nThis is such a great, gentle cleanser. I can safely use this as a morning cleanse for summers. In winters, I used the creamy cleansers like Cetaphil, Cleanseme. But as the weather is changing, I am stocking up on my gel cleansers and this one definitely tops the list. It has a refreshing baby product scent which is a great pick me up! Further, it does not leave your skin feeling dry or tight. \n\nHaircare - \nThis is such an amazing mild shampoo! I was flabbergasted! The days I don’t oil my hair, I can safely place my bet on washing my hair with this and not being afraid of my hair drying out. I’ve an entire shampoo stash that I love but I am more than happy having this as a backup shampoo for the days when I don’t want to do anything other than shampoo and condition. It is also a good hair cleanser to use after herbal powders. ( I add oils to my herbal powders so I need a gentle cleanse post it.) \n\nBody care - \nI think this is a no-brainer. It is a simple, not-too-foaming body wash. It does the job. If you like something stronger or more fragranced for the body then this is not the one. But, it’s great if you want something gentler. I have noticed that my body does not feel stretchy or dry after taking a shower the days I used this in place of my traditional body wash or soap. \n\nIngredient : Water*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, Glycerin*, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PPG-2 Hydroxyethyl Cocamide*, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate*, Sodium Benzoate, Decyl Glucoside*, Citric Acid*, Fragrance, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nAvailability : This can be found legit everywhere.

    "body": "Skin type: Oily, acne-prone  tho years of skincare I think my skin is now normal to oily (esp in t-zone).\n\nI already have a solid routine from my trial and error journey but I can't help myself to try new things out. After all, skincare for me is therapeutic and I don't wanna get bored doing it.\n\n**TL;DR** I love the Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer.  Oxecure cleanser irritated my skin. I still love Human Heart Nature Nourishing  Cleanser.\n\n**Oxecure Ultra Gentle Moisturizer***Ingredients:*  Water,  Glycerin, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, C15-19 Alkane,  Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/vp Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polydecene,  Propanediol, Glyceryl Stearate, Phenoxyethanol, PEG-100 Stearate,  Squalane, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin,  Phytosteryl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA,  Panthenol, Alpha-glucan Oligosaccharide, Potassium Hydroxide,  Maltodextrin, Polymnia Sonchifolia Root Juice, Ceteareth-25, Propylene  Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Cetyl Alcohol, BHT,  Lactobacillus, Pantolactone, Behenic Acid, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol,  Ceramide NS, Ethylhexylglycerin, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract,  Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS, Caprooyl Phytosphingosine,  Caprooyl Sphingosine, Ascrobyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Glyceryl Oleate,  Lecithin, Tocopherol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Calendula  Officinalis Flower Extract, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hypericum Perforatum  Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Tilia Cordata Flower Extract\n\n*Notable ingredients:* 5 types of ceramides - Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide EOS paired with Cholesterol and fatty acids - Caprooyl Phytosphingosine & Caprooyl Sphingosine to mimic skin's barrier function.\n\nAlso has glycerin, panthenol, pantolactone, lactobacillus, squalane, and aloe extract.\n\nFor reference I've tried the well-loved **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream** which unfortunately broke me out. I also hate its texture and how it sits on top of my skin. Then there's the **Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel** which gave me a more pleasant experience than the cream. I have gone three bottles of it already. So yea, I loved it but I also found it boring. Like it's just your regular moisturizer - *Oh no, OP discovered how moisturizer works.*\n\nAnd oxecure moisturizer came into the picture. From the list of ingredients above it is way moooore extensive than the ceramide gel so I was afraid it would break me out. Fortunately, it didn't. In fact, I like it better than the ceramide gel! It is lightweight but you'll know you have applied it unlike with the gel which absorbs completely with my skin. Nevertheless, I still like it for that coz I feel like the previous products I have applied are sealed. It also doesn't pill with my sunscreen. One drawback - it is expensive. 700 pesos for 75 ml.\n\nAlso soothes my skin when it is irritated especially when the horror of using the Oxecure cleanser happened.\n\n**Oxecure ph 5.5 Gentle Cleanser***Ingredients:*  Water,  Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamidopropyl Betaine,  Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate,  Cocamide MEA, Citric Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids, Potassium  Sorbate, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Ethylhexylglycerin,  Ceramide 3, Garcinia Mangostana (Mangosteen) Peel Extract, Centella  Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Sctutellaria  Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla  Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root  Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Aloe  Barbadensis Leaf Juice\n\nSurfactants: Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Cocamidopropyl Betaine (CAPB), Sodium Lauroyl Oat Amino Acids\n\nFrom the first week of using it, I really liked it. It didn't dry my skin out. However, days after my skin started to turn red and patchy whenever I used it. I don't know which ingredient/s sensitized my skin. I'm pretty sure not the SLES and CAPB as they are present to Celeteque cleanser (which I liked). And considering it has lot of hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, kinda bummer this turned out to be a holy fail for me. My body enjoys it now tho. Still, for me it is worth trying coz who knows it might work perfectly for you.\n\nA hunt for a cleanser started. I was using Celeteque Hydration Cleanser for years already. I didn't have any problems with it except that sometimes I feel like it kinda dries my skin especially when my skin is retinizing from tretinoin use. Still I should've stuck with *if ain't broke, don't fix it* mantra.\n\nSo one day I was at Watsons, just the usual window shopping of products. And I stumbled upon Human Heart Nature products and saw the **nourishing** variant cleanser. It brought back memories when I was just starting with skincare. When I was hopeless and felt like every products I used were not helping with my skin concerns, that cleanser gave me hope. I experienced the real definition of gentle cleansing after trying harsh scrubs and whatnot on my face.\n\n*Ingredients:*  water, decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside, glycerin, Solanum lycopersicum  (tomato) fruit extract, carrageenan, tocopherol, sodium lactate, sodium gluconate, dicaprylyl ether, glyceryl oleate, hydrogenated palm  glycerides citrate, parfum, levulinic acid, sodium levulinate, phytic  acid, p-anisic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid\n\n*Surfuctants:* decyl glucoside, coco-glucoside - derived from coconut so be warry if you're sensitive to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo fast forward I bought a bottle of it. I used it for a week before giving my verdict. And now I can say that it is still the gentlest cleanser I have ever used. My skin feels supple whenever I use it. Although it has now a different packaging from what I can remember, it's still my first love. That feeling when everything feels right.\n\n*Hoy vevs iba na 'yan.*",

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo start off, this is a anti-acne cleanser by an India co, Yuderma - I have been using this for 2 months+. My dermatologist who I saw for my first acne appointment in years, recommended AHA glow face wash but I asked her for an alternative. I had already used it for a month and frankly it left my skin too dry, had no effect on blackheads and minor acne. She then recommended Acnelex. I went to the pharmacy and checked out the Ingredient list:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/m976JxN\n\n*Aqua, Decyl Glucoside,* ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate, Mandelic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Oatmeal powder, Green Tea Extract, Aquaxyl, Kaolin, Witch Hazel, Tea Tree Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Bisabolol, Eucalyptus oil, Spearmint oil Sodium Gluconate.***\n\nI thought this was too good to be true, they claim that the  ***Potassium Azeloyl diglycinate (Azelaic cid)*** and ***Oatmeal*** in the formula are procured from UK  & Swiss labs (The ingredient list on their website seems older & in need of update)  I still went in with zero expectations.\n\nIts a creamy cleanser like Cerave or Krave Matcha Hemp; you need to activate it with water and it lathers slowly. It cleans VERY WELL, Unlike AHA Glow which leaves skin dry with a soapy tackiness. During this time, I was using Azelaic Acid 10% on active inflammatory acne so I can't vouch for its anti-acne action but they claim on their website that it combats mild acne. I started Tret for cystic acne a month after I started using this. It is very gentle, very soothing and very very hydrating, I use this day and night.  Skin looks really refreshed and clean, inflammation is diminished and before I started Tret this really removed and helped bring oiliness down. My face feels plump and plush after using it, quite the opposite of what cleansers like Neutrogena and Clinique have done in the past. For the first month I was only using a rose toner, plain aloe vera gel, sunscreen and Exazel N for scars because the cystic & inflammatory acne was soooo active and terrifying. It was puzzling, I was super hydrated and not dry after cleansing.\n\n I looked up Aquaxyl\n\n>Aquaxyl™ offers the 3D hydration hydraconcept for circulation of moisture throughout all skin layers and boosting of hyaluronic acid. The skin barrier is reinforced in 24 hours by limiting water loss. Results are softer smoother skin in 28 days with normal desquamation and smoothing of fine lines. Aquaxyl™ strengthens the skin barrier, promotes healthy differentiation of the epidermis and refills the internal water reservoirs (hyaluronic acid, ceramides and aquaporin boosters)\n\nThe only other face wash that has been on par is the Krave Match Hemp one, its is super hydrating and soothing for oily skin with a tendency for pores and persistent mild acne. Quite often oily skin also tends to be inflamed, which leads to excess sebum and acne; ironically most anti acne cleansers aggravate it. I used the Krave cleanser but didn't repurchase because its too pricey and customs add to it. Acnelex is the closest dupe I have found to it.\n\n**Moreover**\n\nI underwent a laser and 2 peels during the past 2 months and after each I was told not to wash my face for 3-5 days in case my skin would get red, peeling, inflamed etc , no actives or moisturisers to allow for desquamation. BUT I was also asked to wear a sunscreen everyday. I just couldn't follow this instruction. I was not to use oils because the dead skin need to dry and come off, so I couldn't use an oil cleanser or Cetaphil which which would also soften cells. I used Acnelex after a day, smaller quantity and very gently.\n\nIt did NOT cause any discomfort on raw, post. treatment skin! Perhaps the *Oatmeal,* *Green Tea etc*. are in higher dose or of good quality but it was a breeze. It actually felt very soothing and conditioning and I now think my post service bounce back might have been due to washing my face twice a day - this cleanser actually feels really soothing & calming the more inflamed your skin is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail Price: 699.",

Aldi replaced it with Formic Acid for which CosDNA has no irritant/acne score, but did replace Laureth-10 with Laureth-4 which is worse according to CosDNA (but it’s very low on the ingredients list). \n\nAldi foaming wash has added Lactic Acid lower down on the list (Moisturising in low concentrations).\n\nBoth kinds of Aldi wash have added Glycerin.\n\nAt first glance, Aldi improved their face wash while Simple made theirs possibly slightly worse. \n\nAll product images here https://imgur.com/a/Y2qE1LZ",

    "body": "[Packaging and product texture shots](https://imgur.com/a/F6hqmpb) \n\n#Review type \nMixed overall - negative considering the exfoliating claims, but a good soothing cleanser 🤔 WRP. It does \"help to reduce the acne\", as they claim. Just not in the exfoliating _way_ they claim. Read on to find out why 😂\n\n#Skin type\nOily. Sensitive, malassezia (fungal acne) - prone, PIE/PIH-prone, mildly acne-prone\n\n🐳 Age: 30\n\n🐳 Current climate: Hot and dry-ish\n\n#Usage timeline\nStarted using it in April 2021, finished it in March 2022, so that's almost a year. Crazy, right? 😂 Used it twice or thrice a week, as I would any exfoliating cleanser\n\n🐳 Price: ₹350 \"retail\", always available for less. Currently ₹199 for 100 ml [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/gp/aw/d/B08XQRLX3K?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) \n\n#Ingredients\nDecyl Glucoside, Lauryl Glucoside, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Cocodiethanolamide (Cocamide Dea), Propylene Glycol, Gelpol Et-1/​ Acrypol Et-1(Carbomer), Fragrance, Salicylic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Demineral Water\n \n(Had to get it off INCI decoder, the website lists \"Full ingredients list\" as: 2% salicylic acid, 5% glycerin 🙃) \n\n#User experience\nAs a general cleanser, a very nice experience that reminds me of the similarly affordable Clean & Clear Natural Bright face wash (the one with rosewater), that also has a good amount of glycerin. The Rejusure lathers slightly less, even. The Clean & Clear cleanser is one I currently use, and often repurchase, so this is a good thing. \n\nHowever.\n\nI used it up, over the year, and it did absolutely nothing beyond cleansing. No salicylic acid action. Yes, I tried leaving it on for a minute - nothing. \n\nWith the whole bottle over and the review to be written, I finally tested the pH of the stuff, and it's at a pH of 8-9. Before you're horrified, I then realised that face wash is applied on a wet face, and therefore, what my skin is exposed to is far more diluted and milder 🙃 So I tested that as well, [and here are the pH results](https://imgur.com/a/f9Bhg4p). A fine way to finish the bottle up! \n\nThe lathered up product tests at a nice 6.5 👍🏽 Not quite \"skin-identical\" 5.5, but not far off. I believe the mild alkalinity contributes to the good, medium strength cleansing action. \n\nBut here's what the [Paula's Choice website](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredients/ingredient-salicylic-acid.html) has to say about salicylic acid and pH:\n>Salicylic acids works most effectively as a leave-on treatment, ideally within a pH range between 3 and 4. Rinse-off salicylic acid cleansers typically have a higher pH, which likely won’t offer much of an exfoliation benefitnot to mention the contact time with skin is very brief - but the salicylic acid may at least offer skin-calming benefits in this form and can be included in amounts as low as 0.5% to achieve this benefit.\n\nThis face wash is literally basic. Alkaline. Which, hilariously, is what makes it a basic face wash 😂 No exfoliating action. But likely some skin-soothing effect! \n\nI started using an affordable 2% SA serum this month (to be disclosed and reviewed at a later date 👀), that's caused purging and everything. Tested at a pH of four. Very nice. I do know there's salicylic cleansers out there that are more exfoliating, at the right pH and what not, but I personally would get some kind of leave-on, if I'm really hoping to see an exfoliating impact from salicylic acid ☺\n\n#My thoughts\nIf you want a gentle face wash to use every day, sure. The bottle even says to use twice a day, which would be overexfoliating if their pH was at an effective level, but is just fine considering the active isn't gonna be active 🙃\n\nIt may work for acne in the soothing sense. We tend to underestimate the impact of anti-inflammatory treatments, and overestimate that of exfoliants - leading, as many of us have experienced, to over-exfoliation, barrier damage, and/or dehydration 😅 Hydration and soothing often go a very long way to healing acne and breaking the inflammatory cycle. I mean, the whole Korean skincare approach is based on that, and I've come to see that as a sustainable, practical relationship to have with my skin ❤ It works! \n\nI'm not personally super hung up on 5.5 pH balanced facewashes, because AFAIK, the skin reasserts its pH quite easily within a few minutes, since it's washed off so fast anyway, and I think 6-6.5 is the usual pH (will be testing some others to assuage my own curiosity, so I'll update this post if I learn otherwise). If you are very particular about that kind of thing, this isn't the cleanser for you. \n\n... The kicker is, I might repurchase it after all, as a gentle and soothing foaming cleanser. I'd like to see how soothing it really is, when used twice daily 🤔\n\nThe Clean & Clear one is sometimes hard to find, and doesn't have the added soothing benefit of salicylic acid... it's also possible I'll just move on to products that do exactly as they claim. Who knows what the future holds. Not I. \n\nHope this was helpful and/or interesting ☺❤ K, byee!",

The catch is I want it to also include GA (or another AHA), come in a spray bottle (or otherwise be easy to apply, none of those serums for me no sir), be reliable and cheaaap. Which seems to be a tall order, because the only things that meet at least 3/4th the criteria are wash off products 😭",

It has all the good stuff that both Cerave cleansers have, but the main detergent in the baby wash is decyl glucoside which is one the most gentle surfactants out there. \n\nI couldn't use the hydrating cleanser because it just didn't clean my skin enough and I would break out and while I liked the foaming cleanser, I found that the Baby wash felt a lot less drying especially now that I'm using Retin-A, but still made my skin feel clean. One major plus is if you get it in your eye it doesn't burn. The foaming would burn and sting and even leave my eye irritated for hours if it got in my eyes. I couldn't use it to get the last bits of eye makeup my oil remover missed. Now I can. The baby wash is also great as a shampoo and body wash.",

    "body": "**Personal Info:**\n\nI live in nothern europe, so currently cold, windy and dry Climate. My Skintype is sahara desert dry, prone to closed comedones plus some light hormonal acne. Sadly im also super prone to hyperpigmentation. My main Goals are barrier health, hydration, acne & Hyperpigmentation management and getting rid of the damn stubborn CC\\`s... I also follow a kinda skincycling routine wich includes a non AB Retinal product.\n\nIn **Bold** will be the product name + how long i have been using it\n\nin *italic* will be the ingredients i liked\n\n\n\n**Axis-Y Sunday morning cleanser: (using for a month now)** *green tea extract, centella extract, allatonin*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Potassium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-67, Xylitylglucoside, Citric Acid, Anhydroxylitol, Propanediol, Xylitol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Glucose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Disodium EDTA, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Agrimonia Eupatoria Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Allantoin, Perilla Frutescens Leaf Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Extract, Sodium Acetate, Pentylene Glycol, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Natto Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxycinnamic Acid, Rutin\n\nTexture:\n\na balmy texture, foams up to a dense and soft foam\n\nExpirience:\n\nI picked this up because I wanted to change from my old clenaser to something that felt like it had a bit more cleansing power, yet was not stripping. As far as i can tell it seems to accomplish that. It foams up nicely, cleans well and doesent seem to strip my Skin. After washing it off it feels almost as if there is a slight layer on my Skin, but i dont mind it/ think that it contributes to the non stripping?\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Cosrx Propolis Toner: (about a month 1/2 of use)** *propolis, honey extract, panthenol*\n\nIngredients:\n\nPropolis Extract, Honey Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Betaine, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Panthenol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n\nTexture:\n\na waterlike texture, thats just a bit thicker\n\nExpirience:\n\nTo be honest im not overly impressed... its a nice hydrating toner for sure but i didnt notice anything outstanding that would have me choose it again. But it gets a pluspoint for being reasonably priced so i migth pick it up again to reach free shipping...\n\n(3/5)\n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Waterproof Sungel (3 Months of use)** *Aloe*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, T-butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Ascorbic Acid, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide Np, Phytosphingosine, Parfum\n\nTexture:\n\na thin cream Texture, not runny but almost there\n\nExpirience:\n\nIt comes in quite a big size for a Sunscreen, you can find 80 - 100 ml Tubes online for around 15-17 Euros! Wich honestly was the sole reason why i bougth it xD i figured my skin would be fine with the Ingredients and i just hate tiny sunscreens! And well... that was exactly what it is like, its decently moisturizing and doesnt irritate my Skin. But if you have sensitive Skin be careful, it does have Fragrance, smells kinda like very artificial Aloe. You can smell it but only upon first apllication, it doesnt linger. I have been using 1 bottle for 3 months and still have enough for another month at min. so a win!\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Purito Dermide Cica Barrier Sleeping Mask: (3 months of use)** *Squalane, Centella Extract, Jojoba oil, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Ceramide*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Centella Asiatica Extract(250,000Ppm), Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Panthenol, Ceramide NP(3,000Ppm), Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxyacetophenone, Sodium Carbomer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract\n\nTexture:\n\nA thick Cream, feels quite emmolient\n\nExpirience:\n\nI love, love, loe this! Its the first moisturizer that i found that feels like it actually does its job well on my Skin. As a nigthtime moisturizer it keeps my Skin hydrated all through the Night and has my wake up nicely glowy. I love to use this when my Skin is irritated, it really soothes it quickly. Always have this on my Shelf, you would have to pry it out of my dead cold hands, to seperate me from it. One Bottle last me about 2 months.\n\nHG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Mary & May Blackberry Cream Essence: (4 months of use)** *Jojoba oil, ceramides, lotus water, centella*\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Nymphaea Caerulea Flower Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, 1,2-hexanediol, Methlypropanediol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Hydrolyzed Gardenia Florida Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Trilaureth-4 Phoshate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Pvm/Ma Copolymer, Cyanocobalamin, Ceramide Np, Maltodextrin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nTexture:\n\nthin, watery but creamy? (just realized i suck at describing textures haha)\n\nExpirience:\n\nA really nice hydrating and moisturizing Toner, feels like a great balance of the two. Acts nicely as a layer with other Skincare because it absorbs really well. I like it, a bottle lasts me about 2 months.\n\n(4/5)\n\n**Abib Quick Sunstick Protection Bar: ( 3 months of use)** *Aloe, Centella, Ceramides*\n\nIngredients:\n\nOctyldodecanol, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide, Diisostearyl Malate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dextrin Palmitate, Octocrylene, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Maltodextrin, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethyl Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol\n\nTexture:\n\nA translucent stick, glides on smooth, feels a bit occlusive on skin\n\nExpirience:\n\nNicely moisturizing Sunstick, feels good on my Skin and well... does its Job xD I really like the curved shape of it, it relly helps with the application. I just use it for reapplication of my sunscreen, but also sometimes when my Skin gets really dry during the day ( tho its not the best for that)\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n**Numbuzin No.2 Protein 43% creamy Serum: ( 4 months of use)** *Oat protein, Ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, ferments, Rice protein*\n\nIngredients:\n\nAvena Sativa Protein Extract, Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclohexasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Erythritol, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao Extract, Pantolactone, Ceramide NP, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Oryza Sativa Seed Protein Extract, Stearic Acid, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Lactobacillus Ferment, Glycine Soja Protein, Hydrolyzed Lupine Protein, Glucose, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Sweet Almond Protein, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Myristic Acid, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Arachidic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Succinate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance\n\nTexture:\n\nVery thick serum, really is creamy like the name says\n\nExpirience:\n\nSooo repairing and soothing, does wonders for my barrier. It really helps keep my Skin moisturized and helps keep my transepidermal waterloss in check. Love it so much! HG!\n\n(5/5)\n\n**Purito Aha Bha Refreshing Solution: (1 month of use)** *Glycolic acid, Salcylic Acid*\n\nIngredients:\n\nSalix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid (7%), Tromethamine, Water, Salicylic Acid(2%), 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Citrate, Arginine, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid(0.28%), Hydroxyacetophenone, Pentylene Glycol, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Disodium EDTA\n\nTexture:\n\nlike water, it put 2-3 drops on a thin cotton pad and swipe over my Face with it\n\nExpirience:\n\nSince it has only been a month i cannot say too much about how it has worked (and i feel its hard to tell what effects on my skin is retinal and whats from this product) but my comedones are reducing in size and developing into breakouts. But the effects of these ingredients are well studied in these concentrations so i would say its save to say it works. Its my first time using glycolic acid and i can say it packs a punch for sure! So be careful, its intense, so far im using it once a week on my exfoliation day and i dont think ill be moving up.... Might also be the fact that its a combo product, but i have been using salcylic acid and mandelic acid in combo before, and that felt less sensitizing. So im attributing that factor to the 7 percent glycolic acid, since it is the smallest molecule size of all Aha\\`s.\n\n(3.5/5)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow lets move to quick first impressions of a few products i just started trying, wich i have seperated from the review portion because i just havent been using them long enough to really speak about the effects on my Skin: (these will also be shorter impressions with less info)\n\n\n\n**Neo:labs liquid enhancer Pycogenol:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Propanediol, Hydrogenated Poly C6-14 Olefin, 1.2-Hexanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Saccharum Officinarum Extract, Jojoba Esters, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Salvia Sclarea Oil, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa Root Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Theobroma Cacao Seed Extract, Melaleuca Altemifolia Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, Coprylyl Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Squalene, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tromethamine, Albatreus Contuena Extract, Paimitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Phytasteryl Macadamiate, Citric Acid, Phytosterol, Dextrin, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, 4-Terpineol, Pentylene Glycol, Octonediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\nExpirience:\n\nBougth this because of the tea tree extract, oil and 4- terpineol for the antimicrobial and antiinflammatory benefits , plus it also promised balancing the water-oil contend of the skin. So far i have been using it for a week and it feels nicely moisturizing, but i cannot say if it has helped with my breakouts. Smells strongly like tea tree, wich i dont mind.\n\n**Isntree Spotsaver Mugwort Ampoule:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nArtemisia Princeps Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Erythritol, Betaine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Panthenol, Propanediol, Beta-Glucan, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Allantoin, Carbomer, Tromethamine, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nExpirience:\n\nThis i got because i heard amazing things about mugwort and it was on a 50 % Sale, so i got it for a steal! So far i like the simple ingredient list an it seems soothing and hydrating.\n\n**RNW Der.Ceramide Cream:**\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Ceramide NP, Panthenol, Caprylyl Methicone, Glycerin, C12-16 Alcohols, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Ceramide NS, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Oligopeptide-1, Ceramide EOP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Betaine, Arginine, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Carbomer, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Arachidyl Glucoside, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Stearic Acid, Adenosine, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium EDTA\n\nExpirience:\n\nIm really intriged by this brand an was debating between this and the Ceramide serum, but got this Cream. At first i was intimitaded by the essential oils and the strong smell it has (herbal, but to my nose very pleasant) so i patchtested it on my cheek. The Patchtests went fine and i have been using it on my whole face for 4 days now and i must say im impressed.\n\nIf you have oily skin i feel you could hate it but for my dry skin... the texture is amazing. Its a THIIICK cream, like an ointment, very balmy. Upon apllication it feels nice to spread it and it sinks in so well for the thick texture. The cream surprisingly dries down velvety and leaving a protective shield over the Skin. I also love that it has 3 % Panthenol, 3% ceramides and cholesterol and fatty acids.... so perfect ingrdients for skin barrier repair! Really a potential HG...\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Hi fellow skincare addicts!\n\n*Edit: These are not 'new' but in the wake of the Purito controversy I think a lot of people are tying to find sunscreens they can trust. I'm not aware of any independent studies on Daylong but their filters are top of the line + I've had a really good experience with them so I thought I would do this review for you guys :)*\n\nI'm honestly a little surprised how little talk there is about these sunscreens, because they do the job fairly well, performance and ingredients wise. I'm talking about the ***Daylong Face Sensitive*** (normal to oily skin) and ***Daylong Extreme*** (face milk version, for dry to very dry skin). They are both broad spectrum SPF 50. They both claim to be water and sweat proof (I have never really put these particular claims to the test, but fyi).\n\n**My skin type:** .... weird. I am 30+, rosacea prone,  and my skin has changed *a lot* in the past couple of years, it's an absolute nightmare. Everything looks shiny on me no matter what, so I try to that into account for reviews XD I don't wear makeup very often, and my routine at the moment is toner + lotion + moisturizer (+squalane if needed), with little variation. Also I have light skin (FP scale 2).\n\n**EDIT: Forgot to mention that where I live it's very sunny and mostly dry all year round. Tested these this winter, maybe I'll do another little post about them in the coming summer.**\n\nAnyway, the review now!\n\n\\-\n\nIngredients:\n\n***Daylong Face Sensitive*** \\- Aqua, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate **(UVB)**, diethylaminohydroxybenzoy hexyl benzoate **(UVA)**, c12-15 alkyl benzoate, dibutyl adipate, tapioca starch, ethylhexyl triazone **(UVB)**, methylene bis-benzotriazoyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano) (**Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, sorbitol, helianthus annus seed oil, glycerin, tocopherol, dimethicone, lauryl glucoside, polyglyceryl-2 dipolyhydroxystearate, cetyl phosphate, cetearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, carbomer, decyl glucoside, sodium levulinate, triethanolamine, caprylyl glycol, ascorbyl palmitate, ethyl ferulate, sodium anisate, polymethylsilsesquioxane, polyglyceryl-5 trioleate, propylene glycole, rosmarinus officinalis leaf extract, xanthan gum, bht, disodium uridine phosphate.\n\n***Daylong Extreme*** \\- Aqua, Ethylhexyl salicylate **(UVB)**, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol **(Tinosorb M, broad spectrum)**, Bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethmethylbutylphenol, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine **(Tinosorb S, broad spectrum)**, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone **(UVB)**, tyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, l adipate, Pentylene glycol, Alcohol, Sorbitol, Dimethicone, Cetyl phosphate, Cetyl alcohol, Triethanolamine, Tocopherol, Decyl glucoside, Lecithin, Acrylic acid / VP crosspolymer, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan gum, Aloe berbadensis leaf juice powder.\n\n\\-\n\nThese sunscreens are available in several countries in Europe but I'm not too sure about overseas *(Edit: apparently they are available widely but UV filters and ingredients may vary depending on your area)*. Daylong belongs to a group called Galderma, which owns brands like Differin and Cetaphil. In the EU they are very affordable, ranging between 11€ to 15€ depending on where you buy them, at least in my area.\n\nAs far as my experience using them:\n\n**Texture:** they are both pretty nice, the Extreme is a face milk so fairly liquidy and easy to spread, comes in your average tube over here but I think a pump version exists as well. The Sensitive one does come in a pump, and the texture is more like a gel (if you are familiar with AB gel-creams, it's pretty similar to that). Also spreads easily.\n\n**Longevity & comfort:** so this is definitely the strength of these sunscreens in my opinion. The Extreme one has been designed for people who have actual allergies and/or severe reactions to direct exposure to the sun. One generous application of either lasts forever. As in, if I apply in the morning, go out for a few hours (nothing too sweaty) in the afternoon it's still there on my face. I felt the difference in my skin hydration for sure (not feeling as tight in the afternoon vs most other sunscreens I own). Also works really well under makeup, especially the Extreme one (I mostly use MISSHA magic cushion as foundation).\n\n**Whitecast & appearance:** Unfortunately, the Extreme does have a noticeable white-cast. It's not quite the casper look but it's there (can see it more as a tone-up if you are pale but will never look natural on anything darker imo, if that's something that bothers you). The Sensitive doesn't have a white-cast at all but it's not a completely natural look either. It does look a little shiny on me (most things do), not in an offensive way but in a 'I have just put something on my face' kind of way, even an hour later. I find this a little surprising for something targeted towards oily skin but there you have it.\n\n\\-\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nThese sunscreens may not be the most cosmetically elegant I have tried so far, but they are definitely worth a try in my opinion, especially since they are in a very decent price range for the quality. And of course YMMV, so they might work for you cosmetic wise. They have some really serious protection and while I haven't tested the 'waterproof' claims they stayed on my face *forever* with a few hours of exposure (very sunny all year round here and dry, not much humidity).\n\nIf your skin in seriously dehydrated, I would give these a try if you can because for me they really helped with TEWL and keeping my skin feeling comfortable. Would I repurchase? Yes, for times I know I need some serious protection but I wouldn't use the Extreme one if I was going to meet someone, or at least not without makeup, because I would feel too self-conscious of the white-cast for sure.\n\nJust to clarify, these are not HG for me, but I'm sure they could be for dry and dehydrated skin types, and I think they deserve more visibility. The dream for me is finding something that gives me the same level of comfort and barrier but is more elegant.\n\n\\-\n\n**tl;dr: excellent, long lasting protection + helps with TEWL but white-cast on the Extreme version, slight 'glow' on the Face Sensitive one.**\n\nI hope this was helpful to someone!! :)",

        "body": "I use and enjoy the Daylong Extreme quite often. I like that it has good UVA-filters (Tinosorb M, Tinosorb S and Avobenzone). I have to admit that I'm someone who struggles with reapplying sunscreen as often as you're supposed to, which is why I like using (very) water resistant sunscreens, and I also get the impression that the Daylong stays put very well, which I really appreciate, too. \n\n\nI also enjoy how well it applies, it spreads easily and comfortably, but still dries down and builds a film fairly quickly while other sunscreens sometimes seem to never really settle/dry down. The film it forms also seems really even to me, no streaks or anything, and it doesn't sting my skin or eyes nor settle weirdly in hair, eyebrows or lines. I think price-wise it's also pretty good (I usually buy the 200 ml bottle).\n\n\nEven though I like it a lot, I am hesistant to recommend it, because of the aesthetic aspect. I find that it has a whie cast (due to the Tinosorb M) and it also looks very shiny. It doesn't actually feel greasy or oily to me, but the shine is pretty intense. It's also a bit sticky, which doesn't really bother me on the face because I only notice it there when I touch it, but that's why I don't really like using it on the body, where there's more friction happening. \n\n\nPersonally, I can get the white cast and shininess under control with some make up, so for me personally it's not a huge issue, but I think a lot of people might be bothered by it/don't want to have to put make up on top of their sunscreen to make it look okay-ish.",

ZINC SULFATE\n\n**Size / Cost:** £7.99 per 200ml\n\n**Texture/Feel:** Blue, watery gel, very light foam, no fragrance\n\n**Review:**\n\nA bit about my skin for context: I have hypersensitive skin that does not tolerate most cosmetics, rosacea & periorbital dermatitis flare-ups and mild acne. Combination skin with dry cheeks and oily t-zone.\n\nFor my skin type, I've been recommended lightweight cream cleansers, but most will irritate me or leave a residue that flares my dermatitis.\n\nI was a big fan of Avene Tolerance Cleansing Emulsion before it was discontinued. My rosacea to the new formula of Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser, Avene Cleansing Foam and I was stripped red raw by all of their other gel cleansers, so I was scared to try this but I'm very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis feels extremely gentle and non-stripping due to gentle surfactants and a heavy dose of glycerin. It works both on my dry cheeks and oily forehead.\n\nIt contains copper sulfate (which give it its blue colour) and zinc sulfate, both of which have antimicrobial properties, and I've found that it helped to flatten small breakouts on my forehead and chin. It also works to calm periorbital dermatitis around my eyes, maybe due to the anti-inflammatory action of both of these ingredients.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this **10/10**, and I've found it gentler than cult favourites Balea Wash Gel and Bioderma Sensibio Gel Cleanser.",

I suppose cleanser is an easy step for everyone else but for me its one of the hardest to find one that works without clogging me (can’t have residue), cleansing properly (or my pores clog by itself) or destroying my skin (my barrier is easily cleansed away). Also a 10/10 from me. \n\nI guess now we have two people talking about this here 👌🏼",

I guess everyone has different experiences and for this sun cream, I’m the opposite. \n\nMy skin is dry right now as it’s winter down under. I find the BoJ and Round Lab are very similar in consistency. They’re a thicker viscous gel that forms this film over the skin, and it takes ages to dry down for me. It also leaves a blue and white cast on me especially if I reapply and/or don’t apply makeup over it. It is more moisturising and hydrating compared to the Skin1004 though. \n\nThe Skin1004 water fit sun serum spf is a lighter lotion/cream type that gives that burst of hydration without that thick film. Also there’s no blue/white cast and it sinks in very quickly (like a serum). I can apply makeup after a few minutes whereas the other two, I usually have to wait for much longer for it to dry. \n\nI do prefer the other two for winter since it’s more thicker and moisturising, but I’d definitely be using the Skin1004 for the rest of the year as I think it would be great for warmer weather/reapplication.",

I mean, I understand that our experiences with products might be different, but the Skin1004 Water-Fit feels like 10 times heavier than the BoJ or Round Lab Birch. The Air-Fit version - which is a physical sunscreen - was actually really pleasantly lightweight, but this... Feels like a moisturizer for winter time, that takes ages to soak into the skin, but does not absorb fully and leaves a bit of stickiness. Which is interesting, because it really does have a serumy texture, so one would imagine its just gonna dissapear into the skin, but as for me, a layer is kind of just sitting on top. The BoJ one feels a lot lighter to me and also absorbs into my skin a whole lot faster. But this is just my experience. I imagine this must he nice for dry skin or in the winter for some. Btw there are quite a few sunscreens with the same base: Round Lab Birch Sun Cream, Romand Zero Clean Fresh, Benton Air-Fit UV defense (these are all the same Kolmar base formulas)",

If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

I am super happy and honored to be partnering with them to provide more reviews and potentially some giveaways on my social media. \n\nAnyway, all of that is to say that this product from I’m From is the first one that was sent to me from Wishtrend to test/review. They asked me to provide some information about my skin type, skin concerns, and skin goals…and recommend the I’m From Honey Serum based on my responses. So, let’s dig in!\n\nI’m From is a really interesting brand in that they seem to really focus on key ingredients and try to use those ingredients in as high of a concentration as they can in each product. Their Mugwort Essence for instance (I’m using it right now and spoilers…I’m loving it LOL) uses 100% Mugwort Extract…thats it. Other products like the Honey Mask use nearly 40% pure Honey. Really cool. \n\nThe Honey Serum takes a slightly different approach by using 30.63% of their “Honey Glow Queen Complex”. This is a combination of Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Bee Venom Extract, Turmeric Extract, Cinnamon Extract, and Pollen Extract. Honey seems to be the most abundant of these ingredients in the “complex” (which makes sense)…while the others fall pretty low on the ingredients list.\n\nWhen reading over the product description on the Wishtrend site I was excited for the possible hydrating, nourishing, and brightening effects of this serum (it also includes a super small amount of Vitamin C). However, I was concerned because my skin has historically not gotten along with propolis or honey in products. I don’t know if it was that my skin was too oily at the time or what, but throughout my skincare exploration I have tried several honey based sheet masks and a serum from Elensillia with 82% Propolis Extract that broke me out pretty significantly. \n\nOn top of that, silicone and I have had a love/hate relationship for quite some time. And this serum from I’m From…well it’s all about the silicones LOL! Before the honey and other “Honey Glow Queen” ingredients you will find Cyclopentasiloxane, Undecane, Tridecane, and 4 forms of Dimethicone in the formula. So I guess you could say that the “Silicone Complex” in the I’m From Honey Serum is more featured that the one focused around honey.\n\nTo me…this all sounded a little scary and like I was taking a pretty big risk. Two of the things that my skin has had a hard time handling in the past all crammed into one serum (and at high concentrations). I didn’t want my first “PR” experience with I’m From/Wishtrend to be a huge flop. But I pushed onward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oqhhbuiazy41.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e92e771366c0b3f3bc5d1530551be8e04f772f5b\n\nI had seen photos and texture shots of the I’m From Honey Mask and was expecting the serum to be kind of the same. While this Honey Serum is quite thick/dense…it all has to do with those silicones. This product has an INCREDIBLY slippery and slide-ry (LOL) feel to it without being watery or runny. It reminds me a lot of a couple makeup primers I have tried on my hands over the years. Even though Glycerin and Water are the first two ingredients…there just isn’t much movement to this product without the assistance of fingers. I applied one pump to my hand while writing this to just get a quick visual…and after 10 minutes the dollop hadn’t really moved at all LOL!\n\nOnce massaged in...the I’m From Honey Serum really starts to shine (literally LOL). Much like other silicone based products I have used, this serum smooths out and glides so easily over the skin. Just one pump is enough for my big-ol face with some to spare. I found that I have a better time smoothing it out over skin that is sufficiently hydrated with toner/essence vs. dry however. Once on, the I’m From Honey Serum feels quite light and comfortable on my skin…almost like a veil or protective layer on top. Those with particularly oily skin may still find this to be a bit too much though.\n\nThe glow and radiance that this serum provides is really impressive. This is absolutely one of those products that has a near “makeup” effect in that the glow/slight sheen is immediate after one application and not something that needs to be used over the course of weeks or months to see the benefit from. Thanks silicones LOL! In addition to that initial result though, the silicones will help to lock in hydration from toners, essences, and sheet masks while the “Honey Glow Queen” Complex imparts nourishment, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory benefits. Kind of a one two punch that I have really come to love.\n\nOver time I’ve found that my skin seems to stay hydrated and dewy feeling/looking throughout the course of the day without relying too much on facial mists or other hydrators. I have also been able to get away with using a lighter day moisturizer as the I’m From Honey Serum really acts like a moisture locking product. The product also has this honey, sweet, and slightly powdery/floral scent that I really ended up liking.\n\nAt the end of the day…I’m kind of surprised by how much I like this serum from I’m From. I didn’t see any adverse reaction to the propolis and the silicones were actually a plus for me. They really helped to lock in the hydration from my toner and essence which I really needed as I transition into using Tretinoin/Curology…my skin has been D-R-Y! The immediate glow and dewy finish is also really nice. I could see this being a great product to use under makeup for certain looks.\n\nThose that have dry skin (or are experiencing temporary dry skin) will really appreciate this serum either as a separate step or to mix a bit with a current moisturizer to amp up the moisture locking properties. For those with more oily/combination skin…proceed with a bit of caution as this might be a little too heavy or feel “stifling” on the skin. I would suggest using maybe a half pump right after toner/essence to aid in as much absorption as possible. Then, graduate up as you see fit.\n\nPersonally, I will be retiring the rest of my bottle for the summer months to re-introduce it in the fall/as things cool back down. I have always been on the oily/combination side of things…but I anticipate that as my skin adjusts to the Tretinoin and the weather heats up I will become the oily/sweaty mess that I am from June-September LOL! I think the I’m From Honey Serum will be a little too heavy for me at that point.\n\nThe I’m From Honey Serum changed my mind about propolis/honey for sure (I already have several other propolis and honey based products on their way to me LOL)…but more importantly it confirmed what a lot of bloggers, skincare experts, and dermatologists have been saying recently (or all along I suppose). Silicones aren’t as comedogenic and evil as they have been made out to be…at least not for everyone. Formulation/trial and error are key and I think I’m From did a great job with this serum. I was certainly swayed early on by the marketing of brands like Drunk Elephant. But now, I feel more comfortable and confident in approaching skincare products with silicones now…which I think will be helpful in my quest to hold hydration to my skin. YAY!\n\nThings To Note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* While I think The I’m From Honey Serum is a great addition to a moisturizer…I don’t know if it has enough hydrators to be a stand in FOR a moisturizer LOL! It’s missing some watery hydrators like Sodium Hyaluronate to really do a “complete job” it seems. In fact, it might be the perfect companion to the Krave Beauty Oat So Simple Water Cream LOL! That moisturizer is lacking the ingredients to hold moisture to the skin (in my opinion). I may have to repurchase that one to mix with the I’m From Honey Serum in the fall to see if I can make the “perfect” moisturizer for me! \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nGlycerin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Niacinamide, PEG/ PPG- 18/18 Dimethicone, Undecane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Tridecane, 1,2- Hexanediol, Sodium Chloride, Dimethicone/ Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Boswellia Serrata Resin Extract, Honey Extract, Adenosine, Cinnamomum Cassia Bark Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Levan, Decyl Glucoside, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Pollen Extract, Phenethyl Alcohol, Ziziphus Jujuba Seed, Centella Asiatica Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Bee Venom, Citric Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Madecassoside, Fragrance, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Geraniol, Limonene, Citral\n\nWhere To Buy: This product can be picked up on Wishtrend, Amazon, and various other K-Beauty retailers. Since I did mention that I was gifted this product…I’d rather not include a link to avoid confusion/suspicion around affiliated links or commissions. A quick Goggle search should bring up a whole bunch of places where you can grab this serum!",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star. Other soothing, anti-inflammatory extracts make an appearance here, as well as ceramides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7f77tcs8ku31.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd7d7db952d0ec115a2a39a569a337f661ac0789\n\n6. **Idebenone Firming Ampoule - 32ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Rosa Canina (Dog-Rose) Fruit Extract, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydroxydecyl Ubiquinone, Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Adenosine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Human Oligopeptide-1, rh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Acetly Hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Ethyhexylglycerin.*\n\nIdebenone is the synthetic version of the powerful antioxidant, CoQ10/ubiquinone. CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us. Supposedly the fermentation process releases lots more goodies than just using the extract alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myfq67u59ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecfc805f707759f790b86d6dd65460379b6c9674\n\n10. **Saccharo Ferment Sparkle First Ampoule - 100ml/49,000 Won ($41.70)**\n\n*Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Polyglutamic Acid, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract.*\n\nGalactomyces = SK-II, Bifida = Estee Lauder, though which strains are trade secret or something. A very simple ampoule with ferments, a humectant and some plant extracts. They do have a cream version as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0w9k8ta9ku31.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41a8cd57bde651c10bf016cd3d6cea4a2799e937\n\n11. **Saccharo Essential Mist - 60ml/18,000 Won ($15.32)**\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Beta-Glucan, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Paeonia Suffructicosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6471tkd9ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5903dcfdcc876d4365879230722e61b4da4c2130\n\n12. **Honey Peptide Mist - 60ml/8,600 Won ($7.32)**\n\n*Honey Extract, Water, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Glycerin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Butylene Glycol, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.*\n\nA watery, soothing mist with honey, propolis, royal jelly, collagen and peptides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfoo0nzf9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b834384913e4a2a6161fb10bfeed8aeeee4e647\n\n13. **The Calming Essence - 50ml/18,600 Won ($15.83)**\n\nArtemisia Capillaris (Mugwort - Capillary Wormwood) Extract, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Arginine, Cabomer, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, 1,2-Hexanediol.\n\nA very simple, soothing mugwort, panthenol, allantoin, and licorice root essence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0fj8zdi9ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=915ee84ef3cb6c1dec999de951abe84a8b268783\n\n14. **Dr. Troub Bio Repair Powder Cleanser - 60g/15,600 Won ($13.27)**\n\n*Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Disodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sobitol, Cellulose Gum, Scutellaria Bicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Artemisia Princeps (Mugwort - Korean Mugwort/Korean Wormwood) Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Citrus Junos Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Human Oligopeptide-1, Acetyl hexapeptide-8, Copper Tripeptide-1, Citric Acid, Arbutin, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower/Leaf Extract, Allantoin.*\n\n\\[Second cleanser\\] An SLS-free powder foaming wash. The surfactants in this (Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate & Disodium Lauroyl glutamate) are extremely gentle surfactants often used for cleansers targeted toward babies and sensitive skin. They're more expensive but provide a bunch of non-stripping foam.

I am a bit scared to use this,not gona lie, because of all the heavy ingredients, but winters tend to get very dry where my hostel is, hence I am going to go out on a limb and try this out. \n\n2. UV doux sunscreen-pretty self explanatory. This is one of the most raved about sunscreens right now. I am trying to hate pan my Lotus gloop (the damn thing refuses to finish wtf dude)\n\n3. Dermafique toner- i have checked out the ingredient list and it seems interesting (Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260). \n\nI am not big on toners, but seeing panthenol so high up on the ingredient list made me so happy. \n\n4. Aveeno dermexa emollient cream- although I have one body butter and a body lotion to finish up, I still want to go for this lotion solely for my hands and feet. My knuckles tend to get very dry(and sometimes bleed) during extreme dry winters and this looks like could help. \n\n5. Baidyanath/dabur almond oil- i always buy a bottle of almond oil before the winter begins. It is an amazing all purpose product. \n\n6. Sebamed foaming face wash- i am currently using cetaphil. I want to try out something else. No specific reason for choosing sebamed out of everything else. I am not fussy about facial cleansers. \n\n7. Fabindia charcoal face mask- I have used this one before and this cleared up my skin like no other. Fabindia's products are incredibly underrated. This is one Indian homegrown brand that I can fully get behind. I have used quite a few of their stuff and none disappointed me. \n\n8. Neutrogena lip balm with SPF15- no specific reason for choosing this one out of all. Just wanted to try out a lip balm with spf. \n\n9. Any one of nykaa's moi perfumes- I simply love perfumes. i have the one in black(can't remember the name). I want to try out more of their perfume line. I will stick to the minis for now. \n\nThat is all that I have in my wishlist for now! Share us yours!",

The finish of uv doux is good though but that’s pretty pointless for me if the protection isn’t. If you don’t mind the price I’d suggest the avene or isdin. Avene is more white cast and kind of thick. Isdin is cosmetically very elegant.

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

        "body": "I used Coconut and Hibiscus shampoo (for curly hair) with the Mafuka honey conditioner. It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end. You could try another one of their products that may actually wash your hair better and you can avoid all the dandruff but my experience has been bad with this line.",

A lot of people do not.\n\nIf your hair is well repaired and not truly prone to going dry in hours- stop using it. Hold it back as a conditioning treatment on a as needed basis only.\n\nI alternate between other brands of hair stuff, followed by a clarifying wash to get out silicones, then a week of only Shea moisture.

    "body": "Another product I can review on now! I guess I’ll say that this review might be quite an unpopular review since it’s such a generally well-liked product. Sigh. Anyways let’s go. Ps I’m writing on my phone so pardon the formatting. \n\nIngredients: \n\nWater, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Glycine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Aspartic Acid, Protease, Leucine, Alanine, Lysine, Arginine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Proline, Valine, Isoleucine, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Histidine, Cysteine, Methionine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Potassium Benzoate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate\n\nReview:\nThis cleanser is a gel cleanser that gently foams when you add in some water and rub your hands together. It doesn’t have any added fragrances but it isn’t scent free either. There’s the smell of coconut, probably due to surfactants. Idk. A soapy coconut smell haha. \n\nHeres the routine I used:\nAM - wash with water -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser -> sunscreen\nPM - rovectin cleanser -> vanicream daily facial moisturiser \n\nVery simple I know. I’m still trying to fix my skin barrier so bear with me here. When applying it, it doesn’t feel so thick on my face. It foams a little so it doesn’t exactly fluff up too much. The cleanser didn’t feel stripping either. My face felt really soft afterwards. \n\nOther experiences:\nNow, I guess here’s where the good part ends. Let’s say that this cleanser brought waves of emotions and struggles right from the start. \n\nThe next day after first trying it, I woke up with a pimple along my eyebrow. There were also 2-3 CCs forming along my cheek. “okay that seems sus” I thought but shrugged it off and went about my day. \n\nThen over the next 2-3 days, my face texture got worse and my face started to become itchy. The tiny CCs became itchy. I decided to take a break from doing any skincare to let my face heal for a day. Afterwards I incorporated my moisturiser and slowly, the cleanser again. \n\nThings were okay for a day or 2. My face didn’t become too itchy but the CCs were still there. I thought things were finally turning good. Maybe I’ll finally be able to enjoy this cleanser!\n\nUnfortunately my body said no u and I started to get mini hives on my arms and legs every single day. Mind you, I’m already prone to hives due to my anxiety and occasionally sweat. But I’ve never gotten them every day. At first I brushed it off as anxiety and stress. But it got worse and worse each day. I ended up taking Zyrtec in hopes to keep it at bay. \n\nI came across a post on Instagram from this skincare influencer and it was on the cleanser. Apparently she ended up breaking out from the cleanser and experienced itchiness on her face after using the lotion as well. I traced back my memory and realised things got worse when I used the cleanser again. So I decided to stop using it. And as I thought, I wasn’t experiencing hives as much as before. \n\nIt’s kind of unfortunate really, I genuinely wanted to like this product. Everyone was raving about it. But whatever it was in it, my skin just couldn’t handle it. I’ve only truly used it for about over a week, excluding the break I took midway. If I could do this whole thing again, I wish I’d stopped the day when I experienced that reaction. When I had a sudden breakout right after using it. Oh well.\n\nVerdict: \nI’d give this product a 4/10. WNRP. It just didn’t work for me and my skin. And it is what it is . I’m now trying out the dokdo cleanser so we’ll see how things go. \n\nThanks for reading this. Have a good day!",

Could it be the coconut oil derivative in it? I know some people are sensitive to that. Definitely a case of YMMV, everyone's skin is different. Lots of peoples HGs don't work for my skin \n\nI also really like the Round Lab Dokdo Cleanser, hopefully that works for your skin!

Currently for Rs. 269/-. I had bought it as a trial from Smytten\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Cherry Blossom, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree, Aloe Vera leaf juice.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua\n Decyl Glucoside \nLauryl Sarcosinate\nCarbomer\nPhenoxyethanol\nSugar\nPropane Glycol\nGlycerine\nSodium Cocoamphoacetate\nDMDM Hydantoin\nPolyquat 10\nEDTA\nAloe Vera Leaf Juice\nActivated Charcoal Powder\nTea Tree essential oil\nPeppermint essential oil\nCherry blossom essential oil\n\n**Claims:** Paraben free, cruelty free, formulated with 100% natural ingredients\n\n**Texture:** Black liquid\n\n**Packaging:** Tube/Bottle\n\n**Usage:** For a few weeks\n\n**My Experience:** This was my first attempt at a charcoal based product. The idea that it removes blackheads & whiteheads from a mere face wash drew me in. But sadly, this didn’t do anything. \n\nI know that pores don’t open or close, but this facewash made me think as if they are opening wide. My skin looked weird. This facewash felt harsh, stinged my eyes that eventually I threw it away. \n\nI’ve gotta ask, Is it worth trying a charcoal based products or are they all farce?\n\n\n**➡️Plum Green Tea Pore Cleansing Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 495/- for 120 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Glycolic Acid, Green Tea Extracts, Natural Cellulose Beads\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua (Water), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Carbomer, Cellulose, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fda Approved Colours, Fragrance, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, SLS & mineral oil, vegan, cruelty free. Suited for oily, acne prone, combination skin\n\n**Texture:** Transparent liquid with green granules type beads\n\n**Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** It was pretty okay. I didn’t enjoy either the fragrance or the texture. It has tiny green granules, granules not beads that usually absorb into your skin on pressing between your fingers. Due to it, it has felt like a mild scrub than a facewash and I’m not comfortable using a scrub like product on my face daily.\n\nIt also felt mildly harsh on my skin, which is why after a few uses, I was easily turned off. \n\nI still have the product left, that I’m now using to clean makeup brushes. It might work on other skins, but not for me. \n\n**➡️Re’equil Fruit AHA Face Wash**\n\n**MRP:** Rs. 490/- for 200 ml\n\n**Key Ingredients as per the brand:** Fruit AHAs\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Decyl Glucoside, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Aqua, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/​Leaf Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzotriazolyl Butylphenol Sulfonate, Buteth-3, Tributyl Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance, Ci 19140, Ci 45100\n\n**Claims:** Free of parabens, sulphates, silicones & mineral oil.\n \n**Texture:** Yellow coloured fluid. (almost looks like Pee)\n\n**Fragrance:** No fragrance\n\n**Packaging:** Bottle\n\n**Usage:** A few times\n\n**My Experience:** This is the harshest facewash I’ve ever used in my life. The texture is so watery but generates foam easily after coming in contact with water. However, after every wash, my skin felt very tight, which  is why after a few washes, I stopped using it.\n\nSeeing as I still had some product left, I decided to use it instead of shower gel. Damn, My skin felt so smooth after first wash that since then, I’ve been using them as Shower gels for Bath. \n\nI wouldn’t recommend this facewash to anyone seeing how harsh it was compared to other facewash. So think before you buy.\n\n_________________\n\nThanks for reading 💕",

I recently just purchased the no7 Protect and Perfect facial suncream in SPF50, 5 star UVA from Boots http://www.boots.com/en/No7-Protect-Perfect-Intense-Facial-Sun-Protection-SPF-50-50ml_1483958/\n\nI've been using it for just over a week, and my skin is looking amazing. It is clearing up my redness/uneven skintone and PIH - my skin looks almost as clear as when I was 13, before I started tanning heavily in the summer (I'm 22). Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out). I've been having trouble finding a good facial sunscreen so pretty pleased I gave this one a go :)\n\n\n\nIngedients:\nAqua (Water), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Octocrylene, Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene glycol, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano), Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Tribehenin, Cetearyl alcohol, Glycerin, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium cetyl phosphate, Decyl glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Mica, Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Methylparaben, Xanthan gum, Tocopheryl acetate, Ethylhexyl salicylate, Actinidia chinensis (Kiwi) fruit water, Propylene glycol, Sodium hyaluronate, Ethylparaben, Ascorbyl glucoside, Hydrolyzed rice protein, Potassium hydroxide, Alcohol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Retinyl palmitate, Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) extract, Sorbitan laurate, Panax ginseng root extract, Carbomer, Dipropylene glycol, Polysorbate 20, Morus alba leaf extract, Sophora angustifolia root extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium benzoate, Ascorbic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methyl benzoate, Tocopherol, Acetyldipeptide-1 cetyl ester, Palmitoyl tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, CI 77891 (Titanium dioxide).",

I was wondering if there was a cheaper shampoo out there that had similar ingredients/properties/etc. I know that it contains a \"patented Healthy Hair Molecule (OFPMA)\" so it may be difficult to find something close enough. \n\n**Some Background Info:**\n\nI have fine/thin shoulder length virgin (undyed) hair. I don't use any styling products or tools. I typically shampoo every two days, air dry, detangle with a wide tooth comb when dry, and wear up in a loose messy bun most of the time. I don't use conditioner.\n\nMy current apartment has very hard water, and I don't have the option of installing a water softener or anything like that. \n\nSulfate free or low sulfate shampoos don't clean my scap well enough, and shampoos with SLS or SLES tend to irritate my scalp and cause increased hair fallout. \n\nLiving Proof shampoo is the only one I've found that cleans well, does not strip or dry my hair, and leaves my scalp happy. It's just lovely silky hair and a balanced scalp. I am not knowledgeable enough, however, to figure out why!\n\n**The ingredients list is here:** \n\n*Water/Eau/Aqua, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycol Distearate, Octafluoropentyl Methacrylate (OFPMA), PCA Glyceryl Oleate, Behenyl Alcohol, PEG-150 Pentaerithrityl Tetrastearate, IPDI/PEG-15 Soyamine Copolymer Dimer Dilinoleate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Dihydroxypropyl PEG-5 Linoleammonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-47, Laureth-4, Laureth-23, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Fragrance/Parfum, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Magnesium Nitrate, Magnesium Chloride.*",

I think my top budget recommendations would be either Batiste or Dove Beauty.\n\nIf you're interested in attempting to DIY it, I've also used cornstarch with cinnamon and cocoa added (for color since I'm a brunette) and it works super well. It might leave more build up on your scalp than you want, but on days when I know I'm stretching it but don't want to wash, it gets rid of oiliness incredibly well and leaves my hair feeling pretty clean.",

    "body": "Hey there,\n\nSomeone posted about a new sunscreen on skincareaddiction that has recently come out called P20 kids SPF 50+ sunscreen.\n\nIngredients are - \n\nAqua, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dibutyl Adipate, Phenoxyethyl Caprylate, Canola Oil, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated vegetable oil, Glycerin, Silica, Methylene Bis-Benzotrizolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Tris-Biphenyl Triazine, VP/Acrylates/Lauryl Methacrylate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Xylitylglucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Anhydroxylitol, EDTA, Benzoic Acid, Xantham Gum, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Phosphate, Pentylene Glycol, Xylitol, Glucose, Dehydroacetic Acid, Disodium Peroxodisulphate\n\nI've seen a youtuber I follow and admire karen, The Beauty Maverick post a youtube video about this the other day to, although she hasn't listed all the filters correctly in the video, she applies this to her face at min 1.37 so you can see what it looks like I recommend you check it out.\n\nFilters used are -\n\nUnival a plus\nUnival t-150\nOctisalate\nTinosorb s\nTinosorb m \nTinosorb a2b\n\nIt has all the newest filters which as far as I know no other sunscreen does, its amazing I have used this for a week now and it doesn't have any cons for me.\n\nPros are -\n\n* comes in a pump\n* goes on slightly greasy but fades quite quickly\n* no white cast\n* decent price here in the uk and can get it on amazon prime/boots and superdrug\n* No alcohol \n* Does have a 4* boots rating but to be honest that system is overated in my opinion with the filters used it has amazing protection for uvb and most importantly UVA it states on the box it has a UVA-PF above 50 too.\n* No stinging around the eyes\n\nCons are - \n\n* Little bit shiny\n* Depending on how you apply can show in facial hair, but this is one of the best not to stand out that much.\n\nIf your on the look out for a new sunscreen then check this out think you will like it as much as I do.\n\nLink - https://www.amazon.co.uk/P20-Protection-Resistant-Suitable-children/dp/B083M2RBFS?ref_=d6k_applink_bb_dls_failed",

Cleanser - Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam, Toner - Rosewater (Kama or Khadi Naturals), Essence - Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, Moisturizer - Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel. \n\nUsage: I used the BOJ Relief Sun for approximately 2+1 weeks, after the above routine. I reapply once after lunch usually. I try to rinse my face beforehand, but sometimes have to just apply on top of the existing layer.\n\nIngredients:  Water, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract (30%), Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Monascus/Rice Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol,Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Lactobacillus/Rice Ferment, Aspergillus Ferment, Saccharomyces/Rice Ferment Filtrate \n\nTexture, Consistency, Fragrance: Feels like a lightweight moisturizer. Thinner consistency, as expected with chemical sunscreens. It doesn't really dry down, leaves you with a more dewy finish. I didn't see any whitecast when using 2-3 finger lengths. No significant fragrance. \n\nResults & Experience: My first impressions of this sunscreen after initial use were great. It has an amazing texture and the lightweight formula was a dream to blend and to reapply. I didn't experience any pilling or issues with any of my other skincare products. \n\nThe first issue I had was that the sunscreen burned/tingled for a few minutes in my eye area during application. However, since my skin is so sensitive, I'm used to that happening with chemical sunscreen formulations, and didn't consider it that much of an issue. I applied an extra layer of moisturizer around my eye area to help combat the issue. I continued usage normally. \n\nI used this product for about a week and started noticing significantly more acne than usual, but I shrugged it off. I was ovulating and typically do experience more acne breakouts during that time, so just thought it was due to that and decided to power through, thinking it would settle down soon enough. In retrospect, wrong time to start using a new product, but who really has the patience to wait after the product has arrived (not me!). \n\nThen, in week two the breakouts moved from being regular whiteheads and pimples to giant, red cystic acne. That's when I started suspecting the sunscreen. While I am acne prone, I almost NEVER get cystic acne, and within this week I had 5-6 spots all over my face, that were hurting to the touch. I discontinued use of the sunscreen and switched to a known non-irritating sunscreen for 2 weeks for my skin to calm down. \n\nRandomly, last week I decided to give it another try. In the first two weeks of usage, it was super super hot, and I was sweating buckets all day, every day. My workplace doesn't have AC in the lab, so I was exposed to the extreme heat and thought that could have also be a cause of the acne. I wanted to confirm before giving the sunscreen away. I was sitting in the office for the last week, which does have AC, but same results. Thankfully, I stopped usage before it reached the cystic acne stage again, but uncountable smaller breakouts. \n\nBottomline, this sunscreen definitely did not suit my skin. I am not entirely sure what caused this reaction. I suspect I might be sensitive to niacinamide, but normally in small percentages it is okay. Also, some other reviews said it might be the fermented ingredients, but I have used a few products which included similar ingredients without issue. I guess it is just the overall formulation and the combination of potentially irritating ingredients together. \n\nOverall: 2/5, WNRP. I will not even be able to finish the tube, and have already given it to my mom since her skin is much less sensitive.",

This past winter killed my skin… lots of stressors, dry air, inside heat, etc. My rosacea was really flaring and my skin barrier was really compromised. I took a step back from my ZO products (that had been working really well previously) and at the same time found Charlotte. Revisiting old advice, I just went with a simple cleanser and moisturizer am and pm. No actives or anything. I decided to try the Dieux products and now after having them in steady rotation for a couple of months and two empty bottles (instant angel and deliverance) I can definitely say that have both done wonders for my skin. I started with instant angel and immediately loved the texture and moisture it gave me without feeling heavy. Then added in deliverance and found it to really help calm my redness and irritation. After my skin calmed down, I did slowly add back in 0.25% tret and azaelic acid and my skin is soooo happy again which makes me happy! I do lean towards dry skin but am acne prone. Just wanted to give a different perspective for anyone else that comes across this thread!",

It took me a couple months to realize Deliverance was the culprit (I was stubborn and wanted it work). Luckily, I was able to get a full refund and considering Dieux's website even notes reactions from the serum when requesting a refund, I know breakouts must be common.\n\nI'm just bummed that I went from having clear skin that rarely needed concealer to still dealing with scarring and dark spots six months later.

The applicator is big so you get a good chunk. After drying it gives a silky veil finish. Color is white like milk.\n\nApplication: Please please mix the bottle before application, otherwise it will be alcohol impregnated, causing a heavy smell (that vaporizes quickly) and might sting if you have scratches or sensitive eyes. I used the two fingers rule, but it always felt like I was applying too much, which then tended to cause pilling even if I used silicone based makeup or no makeup at all. I had to leave it dry and it had a white cast, but it faded after drying.\n\nWould Recommend: nah, I guess it’s a good alternative for no makeup days, as the silk finish is quite nice by itself, but the alcohol smell was awful. To be honest, if you mix the bottle well the product won’t smell of anything noticeable, but I found that when the bottle was near the end, all applications smelled like alcohol, even after mixing the bottle well. I had heard good things about this product, but I think Bioré can and has done better (like with their Aqua Rich Essence line).\n\nOverall: 6.5/10\n\n———\n\nHOLIKA HOLIKA - Aloe Waterproof Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Fragrance, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, t-Butyl Alcohol, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Root Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil, Ceramide, Phytosphingosine, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Artemisia Capillaris Extract\n\nTexture: think Lubriderm, feels like lubriderm, same texture and absorbs just as quickly. Only difference is that this one does not smell and doesn’t sting the eyes or irritated skin (maybe thanks to the aloe vera?)\n\nApplication: again, same as lubriderm. Leaves skin feel light but moisturized. You can apply primer or any makeup after it dries and it will feel like you didn’t put sunscreen on.\n\nWould Recommend: yes! It has everything I was looking for, it’s lightweight, non-oily, absorbs quickly, it was cheap and leaves no white cast. It’s even waterproof, and I went to some trips where I sweat or went to the beach and didn’t get burnt, so it was effective. I love that this sunscreen is basically a moisturizer that leaves your face a white canvas for any makeup you want to use that day. Holika Holika has never disappointed me when I have tried their products, but this one is by far the best (and that’s saying a lot considering their protein hair mask is the best I’ve tried).\n\nOverall: holy grail / 10 (but as anything else that’s good, it’s discontinued, so my search for a holy grail sunscreen will continue 🫠)",

C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE. DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE. METHYLENE BIS-BENZOTRIAZOLYL TETRAMETHYLBUTYLPHENOL \\[NANO\\]. WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE. DIETHYLHEXYL BUTAMIDO TRIAZONE. DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE. BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE. CETEARYL ISONONANOATE. LAURYL GLUCOSIDE. POLYGLYCERYL-2 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. BENZOIC ACID. CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. CAPRYLYL GLYCOL. CITRIC ACID. DISODIUM EDTA. GLYCERYL BEHENATE. GLYCERYL DIBEHENATE. HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES. HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL GLYCERIDES. POLYACRYLATE-13. POLYISOBUTENE. POLYSORBATE 20. PROPYLENE GLYCOL. SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE. TOCOPHEROL. TOCOPHERYL GLUCOSIDE. TRIBEHENIN. XANTHAN GUM.\n\n**Active ingredient Percentages**:  Octocrylene (9%). Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (4%). Titanium Dioxide (3.4%). Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (3%). Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (2%).\n\n**Why I decided to buy it:**\n\n\\- Retails for 33 dollars for 200ml. I got it in a set with the 200ml thermal water on sale for $22.\n\n\\- Good SPF, good UVA protection (PPD is at least 20 with the UVA circle)\n\n\\- It's a spray format. It's the type of spray you spray in your hands first, then rub in. This leads me to believe it'd be a lighter texture from its fluid nature.\n\n\\- Claims to be water-resistant AND have no white marks.\n\n\\- Fragrance-free\n\n\\- Out of the 3 reviews I could find, all of them were great and one said no white marks.\n\n**My Skin Type:**\n\n\\- VERY oily, especially in T-zone.\n\n\\- EXTREMELY clog and acne-prone. Most moisturizers break me now and I've stopped using emollient things completely aside from sunscreens.\n\n\\- NC30\n\n**The Review:**\n\nI got this sunscreen last year. It has a very slight sunscreen smell, hardly noticeable to me. Very runny texture. I used it a few times during the summer but stopped after using it about 5 times. I stopped because: The no white marks thing is not true for me. It is VERY obvious. It stung my eyes like crazy when it would drip down via sweat or washing it off. The water resistance was questionable to me because it looked like it was coming off really easily with sweat and water. I also tried using it on my body a few times but I ended up just leaving a bunch of white marks everywhere I went because it was transferring everywhere. It felt wet yet oily at the same time no matter how long I had it on. All hope was lost.\n\nHowever, I did start using it again for the last 2 weeks as a facial sunscreen. First I use the Soon Jung Toner. Then I use 4 sprays (roughly 1/4 tsp) only on my face (not the neck... don't come for me, I just hate washing things off my neck and when it gets on my shirts). The weather now isn't too hot where I am so the sweating issue wasn't a big deal. I stopped putting it on my eyelids to prevent the eye-stinging and use a separate sunscreen there now (Hada Labo UV White Gel). I haven't noticed any breakouts from it for the last 2 weeks. I wear it for my daily 20 minute walks. I know it's overkill but I'm trying to use it up and I don't care what I look like on these walks! I've also started wearing it to work under my makeup. It wears surprisingly well under makeup and makes it look really dewy. I didn't use primer or powder. I used the Purito Cica clearing BB cream in #27 which is the tiniest bit too yellow for me. This with the sunscreen probably made the best shade match ever for me. I will attach a picture of me wearing the combo on the top half of my face and nothing on the bottom half.\n\nOverall I'm happy that I managed to make it work because of the great protection it offers, but I probably won't get it again because it's so finicky.  It'll probably last me forever because I'm only using it on my face, so the value is there. I'd recommend it if you've got a foundation that's a bit too dark, or if you straight up don't care what you look like and just want the protection. Just don't use it near your eyes or body. Thanks for reading my first reddit review!\n\n**Pictures:**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Eza516d](https://imgur.com/a/Eza516d)\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add pictures and say that I am based in Canada so it's in CAD.",

The company prides itself on having all aspects of production based in the US. From manufacturing from the chemist to the designers to the tube manufacturers, the product is 100% made in the U.S.A. Helmsman can be purchased direct from their site or on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/](https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman Original Scent is a light, refreshing scent that smell similar to many modern mens soaps and grooming products. This pleasant scent is hard to distinguish individual notes from. In general it is refreshing, clean and crisp. This scent is a nice divergence from complex scents and as such, Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She cannot really smell it once I rinse it away, making it a great user if you want your post shave product or fragrance of the day to dominate. Scent strength is light to mid out of the container and remains that way through the shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman brushless shave cream appears to be a vega based cream. Ingredients are listed as: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water, Stearic Acid, Sodium Methyl, Cocoyl Taurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana, Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Siloxanetriol Alginate, Caffeine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Boswellia Carterii Resin Extract, Silybum Marianum Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Calophyllum Tacamahaca Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Oleic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Ceramide, Sodium Chloride and Citric Acid. Being a brushless cream, this cream can be applied with your hand or a brush but does not require water. Primary and residual slickness are good. I am able to buff without visible lather with no fear of the razor skipping or dragging. Post shave is also good. I am not left dry or tight once rinsed away. The ShaveScore for Helmsman Shave Cream is an 82. For similar performance I suggest you check out: Castle Forbes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Helmsman Shave Cream (promotional gift)\n* Brush - N/A\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)",

    "body": "(TLDR: They discontinued Neutrogena Creamy Fragrance-Free Ultra-gentle Daily Cleanser, which fixed my tretinoin-related dryness/rash. I need to find a new *extremely bland/hypoallergenic creamy* glycerin/water-based cleanser, but tretinoin has made my lower face SUPER reactive and dryness-prone. **List of preferences, cleansers I tried/am considering, and current routine below the dashes at bottom**. I've maintained the results in the first photo. The cleanser ingredients are in the second photo. After that, photos are in chronological order from the start of the reaction to the healing process, with cleansers listed in text. No other products were adjusted.)\n\nA few months into using tretinoin, my skin became EXTREMELY red/irritated/rashy/reactive. I suspect it may have either been an extremely damaged skin barrier or possibly perioral dermatitis, but never had it diagnosed (peak pandemic at the time and couldn't be bothered to get a referral). \n\nMy cleanser ended up being extremely important in the recovery process. Not to be dramatic, but when I started using Neutrogena's **CREAMY formulation** of the Ultra-gentle Fragrance Free daily cleanser *everything changed*. It didn't sting, make my skin tight, or cause redness/bumps. It actually felt MORE comfortable after washing. Within a few weeks my skin was a normal color again and flare-ups of the rash/dryness became much less severe and eventually disappeared completely. My skin *loves* this cleanser. I've been using it for 4 years and my skin looks unbelievably dewy and clear and I regularly get compliments on it. (Pictures included) I still feel occasional dryness/tightness around my nose/mouth/chin if the air is especially dry, but I can completely avoid rashes/flaking by temporarily reducing tretinoin and applying extra aquaphore when I feel it starting to happen.\n\n**Unfortunately, Neutrogena decided to break my heart and replaced the creamy cleanser with a \"cream to foam\" version that sucks absolute butt**. They're really playing up the whole *\"repairing the skin barrier\"* thing with the new line, but it's SO much harsher than the old creamy cleanser.\n\nThe best thing about the cleanser was how few ingredients there were (only 11). It was pretty much just glycerin and water. I've been having a hell of a time finding other creamy cleansers in general (why must everything foam??) but when I do, they've got tons of \"extras\" in there (ceramides, niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, various plant extracts or oils, etc.) and I'm very much afraid they will trigger my skin.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(**Creamy cleansers I've already tried +  Cleansers I am considering + Current routine all listed below**)\n\nThings I am looking for:\n- **the BLANDEST hypoallergenic creamy cleanser you know of; very few ingredients and absolutely nothing \"special\" added**.\n- **Water and Glycerin** as first two ingredients \n- **Creamy soap-free formula** (foam dries/irritates my skin — I don't think it's just an SLS thing; Oil cleansers don't really work for me, and tend to trigger the reaction + make acne on forehead worse.)\n- **Fragrance-free**\n- **No Hyaluronic Acid** (90% sure I'm allergic)\n- **No exfoliating ingredients/actives** (I know some people can handle a little, but I am unfortunately not one of them)\n- **No botanical extract/plant extract/essential oil** or anything else clearly marketed as \"something special/ancient they found in a secret forest/ocean that sets this cleanser apart from everyone else\" (I personally see this stuff mostly as a marketing gimmick, and if you are prone to reactions like me, it just increases the odds of a rash by 1000%)\n\nCreamy cleansers I have tested:\n- **Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser** - tested it on hands last week (because of trust issues). Felt nice while washing, but my hands were itchy and tight 20 minutes later. *Ingredients that were different from my current cleanser*: sodium benzoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, xanthan gum, panthenol, citric acid, niacinamide, pantolactone (note: citric acid and niacinamide are both in the glossier serum I use, so I don't *think* I react to them.)\n- **CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** - Tried this before I found my discontinued cleanser. It stung like nobody's business and my rash always looked and felt worse immediately after using. I'm considering another go, but I'm scared of it tbh...\n\nCleansers I am considering/curious about:\n- [**SVR Sebiaclear Cream Cleanser**](https://ca.svr.com/en/products/sebiaclear-creme-lavante) (Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Niacinamide, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate, Decyl Glucoside, Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Glyceryl Stearate Se, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate)\n\nMy current routine:\n- cleansing (AM/PM): Neutrogena creamy fragrance free ultra gentle daily cleanser (RIP)\n- AM products: Glossier super pure (niacinamide+ zinc) serum, Indeed labs squalane oil, Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream (*LOVE this*), Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream (dryness-prone areas only), Aveeno positively radiant SPF 30 moisturizer, Supergoop unseen sunscreen, Vichy Capital Soleil tinted mineral sunscreen. Aquaphore over dry spots (as needed; usually just near nose in winter)\n- PM products: Eucerin Urea Repair (5%) replenishing face cream, Jamieson Vitamin E Deep Nourishing Day Cream. Aquaphore all over face on tretinoin-free nights.\n- *Trenton every other night*: regular PM products, then add Retin-a Micro (0.04%) and an extra layer of Jamieson moisturizer on top. ",

It's very creamy/milky, it doesn't foam or even really lather, fragrance-free, no hyaluronic acid or any other actives or exfoliating ingredients, no essential oils (does contain chamomile flower extract, though).\n\nIt's the gentlest, most no-frills cleanser I've ever tried. I switched back to it after struggling with dryness & flaking with tret, and it's helped massively. If nothing else, it comes in a little 4oz version for $16 USD, so if your skin doesn't agree with it, at least you won't be stuck with a huge bottle.\n\nMy other, more tentative suggestion would be HoliFrog's Tashmoo Water Lily cleanser, which *does* have water and glycerin as the first two ingredients. It's very similar to Stratia's cleanser, but does contain 3 plant extracts (water lily root extract, lotus flower extract, and spirulina extract). It's also more expensive than Stratia's 4oz version for only slightly more product.",

Everytime I use it my face is visibily brighter, cleaner, fresher, all those adjectives. This cleanser makes me glow. AND if i have a pimple it's visibly reduced after just one use. The pimple's not gone but it is smaller and after 2 days *it is* gone. This cleanser does not dry me out at allllllll. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a godsend i need everyone to try it. I was kinda hesitant to try this because most of the reviewers I watched had oily skin but I honestly think any skin type can use this and see results.

I've never done a review on here before, but I felt I needed to share this product with the community, especially since I haven't seen this one mentioned too much.\n\n**My background:**  I am a 26-year old female with sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin that is very fair in tone. I tend to get severe cystic acne on my chin and around my jawline which turn into purple scars that take months to disappear.\n\nMeet SIORIS' Day by Day Gel Cleanser. I found out about this product on a K-beauty blog article outlining double-cleansing products for those with cystic acne (I seriously need all the help I can get). This cleanser was being touted as a 99.9% natural, gentle, low-pH, low foam cleanser perfect for use after oil cleansing. It's reasonably priced ($22.99 for 150 mL on Amazon), but still a little more than I'd spend on a face wash; I decided to splurge on this to try to help fix my skin. \n\nSIORIS claims that the cleanser's pH is 5.52, and that 61% of the ingredients are composed of organic essential oils (generally this means the ingredients are grown without the use of traditional pesticides, but many companies use it synonymously with \"natural\", so this didn't have too much of an effect on my decision to purchase this. Source: Currently working on my Ph.D. in organic chemistry). That being said, the ingredients list looks promising:\n\n\"\\*Golden Jeju Pomelo Peel Extract (56%), Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Houttuynia Cordata Extract (5%), Lauryl Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-5 Oleate, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract (2%), Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Propanediol, Water, Citric Acid, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil (\\* indicates organic farming)\" (Source: Amazon; ingredients are not listed on the bottle itself)\n\nNote only one ingredient is \"farmed organically\". Again, not an issue for me, but I wanted to disclose this in case anyone is trying to go all natural. From what I was able to research, most, if not all, of these ingredients, especially those at the top of the list (i.e. There is a higher concentration of them in the product) have a low comedogenic score (around 0-2). The higher this number, the more likely the ingredient is to clog your pores. One of my caveats with this product is that, allegedly, since it is composed so heavily of natural extracts, it has a shelf life of only about 6 months. I prefer my products to have a shelf life of anywhere from 8-12 months, especially when they come in a relatively large container like this one. \n\n**Now for my personal experience:**  I used this cleanser after oil cleansing in the evening and as my primary cleanser first thing in the morning. The first time I used this, I noticed that feeling we all love from a good AB cleanser; no skin tightness or \"squeakiness\"! I felt as though this preserved my moisture barrier well, both after oil cleansing and cleansing alone. This truly goes on like a gel; there is little to no foaming, which is a good sign for those with sensitive or dry ski since foaming agents tend to also be drying and/or irritating for some people. However, this was indeed sufficient to remove excess residue from my oil cleanser. I found 3 pumps of this cleanser to be the right amount during both morning and night cleansing. This is definitely going to last a long time, so hopefully I can use it up before the 6-month expiration mark!\n\nThe morning after using this, I noticed a decrease in inflammation around my acne which continued over the next few days of use. Obviously just this cleanser isn't going to be enough to heal severe cystic acne, but I can definitely vouch for its ability to reduce sometimes embarrassing redness. I've been using this for several weeks at this point, and I really only have good things to say about it. The only thing I really dislike about this is the smell. It's to be expected that a cleanser marketed as \"all natural\" isn't going to have any fragrance, but the smell of all these extracts mixed together is honestly a little off-putting. I'm fine dealing with it, but those with more sensitive noses may not be! \n\nI'd give this a solid **4.5 out of 5 stars**, losing points for the short-ish shelf life and weird smell. This is honestly a GREAT gentle cleanser for those with similar skin conditions to mine. I would definitely recommend sensitive skin types to give this a try!",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dgkfl4slnmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0629b1c0fd6de31259da451ee33d2fc741e91bf2\n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

I can't find a Bioderma link for the exact one.\n\nCosdna: Acne/Irritant ratings all blank or 0\n\nIngredients: Water (aqua), dicaprylyl carbonate, octocrylene, methylene bis- benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, methylpropanediol, ectoin, mannitol, xylitol, rhamnose, fructooligosaccharides, laminaria ochroleuca extract, decyl glucoside, c20-22 alkyl phosphate, c20-22 alcohols, xanthan gum, propylene glycol, citric acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, sodium hydroxide, microcrystalline cellulose, pentylene glycol, 1, 2-hexaneidiol, caprylyl glycol, cellulose gum, disodium EDTA.\n\n\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Great protection\n* Cheaper unit cost than many high-PPD, cosmetically elegant sunscreens\n* Bigger bottle\n* Rubs in nicely, white cast/greasiness are minimal\n* No fatty alcohols\n* Easy measuring (2 pumps = 1/4 tsp)\n\n\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Still not cheap\n* Contains cyclops, which can be a problem for some\n* Slightly greasy, may be too greasy to bother with for those with very oily skin\n* Long turnaround time to order from France\n\n\n\n**Verbiage**\nMy main skin-care concern is now fading PIH from old breakouts. They are dark and stubborn, and I am plying them with lots of actives (BHA, AHA, Vit C-E-Ferulic, retinaldehyde, niacinamide + NAG). Because of this, I decided to go big or go home with regards to sunscreen.\n\n\nI apply 2 pumps to my face, waiting a few minutes in between if possible. I also use 1 pump for my upper chest and 1 for my neck. This soaks in much faster than EltaMD UV Physical, but not as fast as Biore UV Perfect Face Milk 50+ PA++++. There is a slight white cast that fades, though I am quite pale (NC15) so it is not noticeable anyway. The silicones make it feel a bit slick on application though I think this decreases also after a few minutes. My combo skin does end up looking a bit too shiny, so I use powder to cut the shine (either directly over the sunscreen, or over foundation if I'm using it). Those with oily skin will probably need decent soaking-in time plus a dusting of powder. \n\n\nI used this while camping for the past week. On a couple of occasions I applied makeup and was faced with the reapplication problem. I'm happy to report that I was able to reapply the Bioderma OVER my powder dusting by using 1 pump at a time and gently patting (not rubbing) over my face. I then reapplied my powder and was good to go. This did feel a bit heavy by the end of the day but OCM took care of that.\n\n\n\n**Comparisons**\nI also use the following sunscreens:\n\n* EltaMD UV Physical, SPF 41, PPD (8 maybe?), 85 g, $22 last purchase through lovelyskin.com (on sale), net unit cost $25.88/100mL (assuming 1 g = 1 mL)\n* Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense tinted, SPF 50, PPD (20ish?), 50 mL, last purchase $28 through lovelyskin.com (on sale), net unit cost $56/100 mL\n* Biore UV Perfect Face Milk, SPF 50+, PA ++++, 50 mL, $15 last purchase, net unit cost $30/100 mL\n* Kanebo Allie UV Moisture Gel, SPF 50+, PA++++, 50 mL, $20 via ebay incl. shipping, net unit cost $40/100 mL\n* La Roche Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral tinted, US formulation, SPF 50, PPD ?, 50 mL, $20 at CVS, net unit cost $40/100 mL\n\n\nHope this helps a bit in the ongoing quest for HG sunscreen.

How do you work in the actives you listed, and what particular products did you buy that contained those actives (do you happen to know the concentrations)? \n    \nI've been playing with the idea of getting the bioderma sunscreens to help even out my skin and prevent my pih from darkening more, but am still on the fence. I'm worried about cost vs whether I'll like it (I have problems with stuff sitting on my face and making me look oily).  It also doesn't help that I sweat easily and want a sunscreen that can stay matte/be sweat proof (bioderma is waterproof, so would it technically be sweat proof?). Not to mention I'm a darker/more tan individual, so according white cast is yet another thing to look out for.\n     \nThis appears to be a chemical only sunscreen. Did you find you needed to reapply every two hours when you went camping? Did you reapply regardless? Also were you able to visually notice the difference in protection that this offers (if you've been using it for long enough to note)?\n  \nSo do you think this is going to be your hg sunscreen? Will you switch back with any of the ones you listed?  \n    \nSorry for all the questions! I'm still struggling to find a sunscreen that works best for me :-(",

    "body": "TL;DR Foaming cleanser with Coco-Glucoside was too stripping. Started experimenting with the emulsion-cream formula (Sodium Polyacrylate, oils, Glycerin, surfactants/solubilizers) – better but still too strong. Got some random papules. Need help with a cleansing formula to make it less stripping but without residue that might contribute to acne. A simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe left a residue, got some papules and one nodule because of it.\n\nDetailed version:\n\nSince simple foaming cleanser with just 2.7% Coco-Glucoside (and less=no foam) was too stripping to my combo (oily-normal-dry) skin I started experimenting with non-foaming emulsion-cream formula.\n\nI used Sodium Polyacrylate (Cosmedia SP) as an emulsifier and thickener. 1-2%, then found that 2 was too much.\n\nI used some surfactants/solubilizers with it, usually Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate at 0.5-5%. 2-5% was too strong. Every time I tried to add Coco-Glucoside (with an additional thickener, like Xanthan Gum), it was too strong, usually, 4 uses and my skin was crying for help. Even with oils, which I describe below.\n\nThen I added some oils, usually caprylic/capric triglyceride or grapeseed oil. 2-5%. Anything below 5% was too strong. I wonder, maybe Cosmedia is just too good at emulsifying sebum on the face. I still want to use it because it feels great at distributing it on a wet face and it's easy to rinse off.\n\nSo it mostly looked something like this:\n\n* 4-5% Oils\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 0.5-2% Surfactants/solubilizers\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* Lactic acid to pH about 6.\n* Then I tried something simple like:\n* 4% Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Sodium Polyacrylate\n\nIt was still a little too strong, but sebum production lowered and my skin calmed down a little.\n\nNext, I tried something like this:\n\n* 2% Grapeseed oil\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 1.1% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 0.85% Sodium Polyacrylate\n* 0.5% Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate\n\nToo strong. Added more oils to 5% total. It's better, but my dry areas are still tight (cheeks) and normal areas a little tight. And now I have a problem with 2-5 papules on oily areas (forehead).\n\nSo I'm not sure what could I change and what's causing inflamed pimples – maybe it's still too stripping or it's because of some PEG-7 residue? I read that it's a surfactant AND a refatener.\n\nSpeaking of residues – I tried to make a simpler version of Cerave Hydrating Cleanser dupe:\n\n* 3% Glycerin\n* 2% BTMS-50\n* 2% Cetyl Alcohol\n* 0.5% PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n* 0.5% Glyceryl Stearate Citrate\n* 0.5% Hydroxyethylcellulose\n\nI used it like 4 times and didn't like it as it left a powdery residue (I think it's a BTMS and/or Cetyl Alcohol?) and I got some papules and one nodule. It was 16 days ago. I read that BTMS can break some people out badly, I wonder if maybe these papules that I've been getting lately was still because of a cleanser with BTMS that I used 4 times 2 weeks ago.\n\nI know it's not a place for acne, but I think it was important to mention it. I think most of my acne is because of just using too stripping cleansers and/or a residue of product.\n\nI am open to suggestions, I can replace Sodium Polyacrylate with something else, but it's hard to get some emulsifiers/solubilizers here in Poland so I'd like to use it.\n\nI use a simple cream after cleansing:\n\n* 5% Dimethicone 350 CST\n* 4% Betaine\n* 2% Sodium Polyacrylate - I think I'll lower it to 1-1.5% because it's a little too thick and it dries too quickly. Or maybe add something like Sorbitol?\n* 1% Phenoxyethanol & Ethylhexylglycerin  \n\nHere's a list of emulsifiers/surfactants/solubilizers (except ingredients which I described above) which I can buy here I Poland:\n\n* Olivem 1000 - I'm afraid a little that it'll contribute to acne, even in a rinse-off product.\n* Creamy Base 1-1-3 *(Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate, Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Trilaureth-4 phosphate, Lauryl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin)*\n* Self-emulsifying creamy base *(Glyceryl Stearate Citrate (and) Sucrose Stearate (and) Sucrose Distearate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Cocoate (and) Cetyl Alcohol (and) Sodium Ricinoleate)* \\- it contains Fatty Alcohol and I'm not sure if it contributed to acne or it was just BTMS.\n* Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate - the description says it needs to have 15-40% of oils to be stable, so I think it's not a good idea for a cleansing formula.\n* Glyceryl Monostearate - it needs to have pH >6.8\n* SLP *(Sorbitan Laurate, Polyglyceryl-4 Laurate, Dilauryl Citrate)*\n* Polysorbate 20, 80, 85\n* *Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate* \\- Again, Fatty Alcohol\n* Simulgel Thickener (Sodium Acrylate / Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer & Isohexadecane & Polysorbate 80) - maybe it would be a better option than just Sodium Polyacrylate\n   * Or this: Emulcold Extra (Sodium Acrylate; Acryloyldimethyl Taurate; Dimethylacrylamide Crosspolymer; Isohexadecane; Polysorbate 60)\n* Polawax (Emulsifying Wax NF)\n* Gosulin IL *(Isoamyl Laurate & Isoamyl Cocoate) -* not an emulsifier, but I read it can be used to wash off dimethicone easily.\n* Carbomer - I think it can't be used alone to emulsify, but it works well with Sodium Polyacrylamide, so I can use less Cosmedia and lower pH >6 without loss of a viscosity \n* Surfactants:\n   * Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside (O110) - I read that it's harsher than Coco-Glucoside.\n   * Decyl Glucoside (O10) - same concerns as above.\n   * Lauryl Glucoside\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids - it's a new ingredient in a shop, I haven't made a research about it yet.\n   * Cocamidopropyl Betaine - I think I'm allergic to amphoteric surfactants or it's because of some of it binds to the skin? My skin is itchy after I use it a couple of days in a row.\n   * Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate - same as above.\n   * Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate - a product with it made my hands very dry, so I think I don't want to use it on my face. Which is sad because studies have shown that it's one of the mildest anionics...",

Not sure if you’d be able to find that ingredient in your area. \n\nThe product I got has 25% active surfactant matter, and I use it at 4% in my formula, so the surfactant in the end-product is 1%. \n\nI just used distilled water, a thickener (could be some kind of gum), 0.2% Hyaluronic Acid (instead of glycerin), the SCG (surfactant), and preservative.\n\nIt’s obviously more a gel cleanser than a cream. It doesn’t foam. I just gently massage the gel around my face. It’s enough to get my pores clear. Doesn’t leave any residue. \n\nIf you needed it a bit stronger you could try 5% sodium cococyl glycinate (that’s calculating for a product with 25% active surfactant matter). \n\nAnother thing-  if you want to try a different oil in your formulas, you could try Neossance Squalane (from sugar cane). It is non-irritating and non-acnegenic. Doesn’t have any astringent qualities. Very lightweight but conditioning oil.",

Commercial cleansers utilises a mix of surfactants to increase the micelle size and gentleness.

    "body": "I feel like everyone talks about the Abib sunsticks being their holy grail product... so how come everyone's sleeping on the Sun Essence?! But hey... they say you gotta start what you wanna see, so I'm going to hype this product up a little in the hopes one of you will find it!\n\nProduct Name: Abib Heart-Leaf Sun Essence Calming Drops / SP50+ & PA++++\n\nIngredients: >!Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Houttuynia Cordata Extract (50,000ppm), Ethanol, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Phenethyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Polysilicone-15, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Hexyl Laurate, Niacinamide, Polyglyceryl-6 Stearate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Aspergillus Ferment, Triticum Aestivum (Wheat) Seed Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Decyl Glucoside, Hydroxyacetophenone, Tromethamine, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Polyglyceryl-6 Behenate, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Glycerin, Sodium Phytate, Maltodextrin, Lipase, Protease, C20-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum!<\n\nFirstly, I have oily, seriously dehydrated skin. One of my biggest concerns when wearing sunscreen is looking shiny and greasy enough I could act as a mirror. The Abib sunscreen glides right over my face and ends up with the perfect semi-glowy, semi-matte finish, and depending on if you pair it with or without moisturiser, this finish can be modified. This is to say, you can have a richer,  more moisturised finish in the winter, and a lighter, breathier finish in the summer. Never has it had me end up looking like a disco ball at the end of the day, but never has it ever dried me out. \n\nYou might be thinking: you have oily skin, why would you dry out? Well, I've also bought three friends this product, all of whom now use it as their primary sunscreen. One of these friends has dry skin resembling a reptilian's (her word's, not mine). Guess what: the Abib sunscreen doesn't just not dry her out, it actually helps maintain a glowy finish on her face!\n\nNow, I know your skin type isn't the only thing affecting finish. I've been using this product for about a year now, and have worn it consistently (3+ weeks daily) in climates ranging from 30**°** C to -25**°** C. I've worn it in wet and humid climates (a literal rainforest) and in cold and dry American weather. No matter what test I've put it up to, it's held up. The sunscreen doesn't budge!\n\nSecondly, I have dark skin. The sunscreen leaves \\*no\\* white cast. Prior to this, my holy grails have been the Skin 1004 HyaluCica Waterfit Sun Serum and the haruharu wonder airyfit black rice sunscreens. I thought these left me with no white cast. When I compared both to the Abib, I could see a genuine difference. The Abib instantly disappeared. The haruharu and Skin1004, while barely visible, were significantly greyer on the skin than Abib! The finish is also less dry than haruharu and less oily than Skin1004. In fact, if Skin1004 is your winter sunscreen, I recommend trying Abib just for the summer.\n\nThirdly, I break out pretty easy. So does my dryer skinned friend. Not once have I broken out after introducing Abib into my routine. It doesn't make my eyes sting either! Of course, if you're particularly sensitive to Niacinamide, YMMV. The sunscreen does contain alcohol, which I am usually very sensitive to, but I tried this product on the recommendation of another friend, and blind tested it, and it has not reacted poorly to my skin so far.\n\nFinally! It doesn't pile under heavy makeup! Despite the niacinamide, which otherwise always piles for me!! Absolute HG product and I truly, truly recommend you try!!\n\nP.S. Do you have any idea why this is so underrated?\n\n",

Mineral sunscreen used to be called sunblock, but the phrasing \"sunblock\" was banned because it doesn't 100% block UV rays, so now it's all called sunscreen. \n\nMineral sunscreens will have Zinc Oxide and/or Titanium dioxide, which sit on top of the skin, creating a barrier from sun rays, and often leave a bit of a white cast. However, if you want to prevent tanning then this is the only possibility. It won't completely stop you from tanning, but it minimizes it to the slightest degree. Some brands also have some that don't go on white and will actually blend with your skin, so there is no white cast. \n\nChemical sunscreens protect by aborbing the rays, converting them to heat and then releasing them. This method doesn't help prevent tanning at all. And personally, I tanned so much faster when I tried this. It was a horrible mistake lol. It was a higher spf than my mineral sunscreen and I didn't know the difference yet. I tanned so much darker than I ever have in my life (even to this day) and in mere hours. I cried lol. I have eczema on my face and I guess eczema doesn't tan! So it looked absolutely atrocious. Anyways, that was the summer that I educated myself. \n\nDon't let anyone tell you that chemical sunscreen prevent tanning.",

I'm in Canada and was using Live Clean shampoos and loved them, but wanted something in a bigger bottle as my boyfriend showers at my place often and we were just blasting through those little bottles together.\n\nI thought Yes To Carrots would be a great replacement, and at first it was fine. But after about six weeks of use, my hair is very dry and I'm experiencing itchy, flaky scalp for the first time in years. Granted, this could be due to the extreme cold weather we've been experiencing of late, but I'm pretty certain it was the shampoo.\nAlso, I'm not sure if the Live Clean shampoo contains silicone, and using Yes To Carrots simply revealed the true state of my hair (which is admittedly pretty damaged at the ends).\n\nEither way, I didn't enjoy the shampoo. On a more superficial note, the shampoo was very thick and difficult to squeeze out of the small opening (not an issue with the conditioner), so I unscrewed the cap and eventually just transferred it to a different bottle.\nAnd perhaps my biggest complaint: it BURNED my eyes! I'm not one to let shampoo run down my face in the shower, but I somehow couldn't keep this stuff far enough away from my eyes.\n\nAnd the conditioner, meh. It was fine.

If you would like an introduction with some common definitions, please see [Cosmetic Chemistry 101](http://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyAddiction/comments/2a671y/cosmetic_chemistry_101/).  Please note that some parts of this are simplified for understanding. If you do not understand a part of this, please feel free to message me or comment about which part you do not understand.\n\n***\n\n###What are Surfactants?\n\nA surfactant is a material that greatly reduces the surface (or interfacial) tension of water at low concentrations.^[1][2]\n\n**How does that relate to anything?**\n\n1. Reducing the **surface** tension of water allows for water to spread easier (see [picture](http://commercial-cleaning-products.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Water-and-Surfactant.png)).\n\n2. Reducing the **interfacial** tension (*interfacial meaning between two faces*) between water and an oil/lipid allows them to mix where previously they can't. *[If you want to test this, get a cup and pour some water in, and then pour some oil (e.g. canola oil, olive oil, etc) in and watch how they interact. Try mixing them and seeing what happens.]* \n\n3. At a certain concentration of surfactant and solution (aka Critical Micelle Concentration),^[3] micelles form. \n\nThe combination of these three things is what helps wash away dirt and oil from your body. \n\nNow let's delve into some more details about surfactants.\n\n##What makes up a surfactant:\n\nA surfactant is composed of two parts, a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. (Remember hydrophilic = likes water so it is soluble, and hydrophobic = repels water). See illustration of this [here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png/400px-TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png).\n\nThis can further be broken into four categories based on the charge of the head (nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric). I won't delve into detail about this yet.\n\nIt is highly important that there is a polar and an apolar part because this is the reason it is possible for surfactants to lower surface tension. The apolar part sticks out and becomes the surface, lowering the surface tension (superficial free energy). [This is a graph showing the surface tension of SDS solution.](http://i.imgur.com/fwPWwAv.png)^[4] The relevant curve is the one with diamonds (PVP=0g/L). The effect is seen at very low concentrations.\n\nSo that's how one part works. \n\n##Remember how I was talking about micelles before?\n\nThey're important now. Micelles are an aggregate of all the surfactant parts (all the head and tails are aligned) such that it makes a nice little circle like [so](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0d/Micelle.png/220px-Micelle.png).\n\n*Note: this is for oil-in-water, for water-in-oil it is reversed where the tails are the outside and the heads are inside due to polarity. This comes to play for emulsions, where I will delve into this in more detail.\n\nSoap/shampoo is a surfactant because it forms water-soluble micelles that trap the otherwise insoluble dirt and oil particles illustrated [here](http://us.arcanatura.com/wp-content/uploads/whatisshampoo.png).\n\n##5 main Applications of surfactants\n1. Cleansing\n2. Emulsification\n3. Solubilization\n4. Conditioning\n5. Special effects\n\n\n##Common types of surfactants in cosmetic products\n* Acyl-amino acids & salts\n* Alkyl ether sulfates\n* Alkyl glyceride sulfates\n* Alkyl polyglucosides or glycerides\n* Alkyl sulfates\n* Alkyl sulfonates\n* Alkyl-aryl sulfonates\n* Amide ether sulfates\n* Betaines\n* Carboxylates\n* decyl glucoside\n* disodium cocoamphodiacetate\n* Ethanolamides or alkanolamides\n* Fatty acid isethionates\n* Phosphate esters\n* polyglucose/lactylate blend\n* Sulfates\n* Sulfoacetates\n* Sulfonates\n* Sulfosuccinates\n* Taurates or taurides\n\n\nNote, I will make a second part to this because it is getting long!\n\n\n***\n## Definitions\n* **Surfactant**: A material that greatly reduces the surface/interfacial tension of a liquid.\n* **Interfacial**: Between two faces (e.g. between two materials such as oil and water)\n* **Lipid**: Naturally occurring organic compounds that are related by their insolubility in water and solubility in organic solvents (benzene, chloroform, etc). ^[5] Examples include fats, steroids (cortisol, etc), fatty acids, and waxes.\n* **Micelle**: An aggregate of surfactants dispersed in a liquid.

    "body": "It looks like Bioderma launched a new product in their Photoderm range - [Photoderm NUDE Touch SPF 50+](http://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/nude-touch-spf-50-natural-tint) (link is to the international version of their site). It looks to be a tinted physical-only sunscreen with a powdery finish aimed at combination to oily skin.  \n  \nClaims include:  \n* SPF 50+ UVA 25  \n* Photostable  \n* Very water resistant  \n* Ultra-light texture, silky application, powdery finish, matifying and soft-focus powders for an anti-shine action  \n* 8 hour oil control, contains salicylic acid to smooth skin texture  \n* (Still advise to \"reapply frequently after swimming, rubbing or sports\")  \n  \nIngredients:  \nZINC OXIDE [NANO], DIMETHICONE, ISODODECANE, ISOSTEARYL ISOSTEARATE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER EXTRACT, TITANIUM DIOXIDE [NANO], PROPYLHEPTYL CAPRYLATE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, METHYL METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, SILICA, POLYMETHYLSILSESQUIOXANE, IRON OXIDES (CI 77492), AQUA/WATER/ EAU, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, HDI/TRIMETHYLOL HEXYLLACTONE CROSSPOLYMER, PEG-10 DIMETHICONE, POLYSILICONE-11, TRIETHOXYCAPRYLYLSILANE, SALICYLIC ACID, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, IRON OXIDES (CI 77491), CAPRYLOYL GLYCINE, PROPYL GALLATE, IRON OXIDES (CI 77499), HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, TOCOPHEROL, ECTOIN, MANNITOL, XYLITOL  \n\nThe international website claims there are 3 tints available but on the French website I could only find two (looks like the palest one is missing). I could not find this on the Belgian website so it probably hasn't launched everywhere in Europe yet.  \n  \nI'll be picking this up when I manage to get to France and update this sub with a full review but for the moment I was wondering if anyone had tried this and had some first impressions they'd like to share?",

    "body": "Hi, everyone! A little background on my hair: I have 2A hair that gets mildly greasy with very dry ends that suffer extreme knotting due to the waviness. I wanted softer hair that I would need to wash less. After deciding that I would go nopoo, I went a week with no washing and it looked pretty horrible although washing and scrubbing with water helped some. I was going to use baking soda and acv at the end of the week, but I learned about the pH of baking soda and didnt want to dry out my scalp or risk it getting onto my face. I bought Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo at Walgreens for ten dollars. This stuff was amazing! My hair wasnt devoid of oil and it didnt do the backlash of intense oil afterward. It just helped to remove some grit and moisturized my scalp. The second week I did only water again and it took around 3 or four days to start showing grease. Im on week three now with water only and washing with the \"shampoo\" and acv once a week.  Here are the ingredients:\n\nDeionized Water , Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Beets) , African Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) , Aloe Vera Leaf Juice , Argan Oil , Panthenol (Provitamin B5) , Rosemary Extract , Sea Kelp Extract , Vitamin E , Lonicera Caprifolium Flower Extract (Honeysuckle) , Lonicera Japonica Flower Extract (Japanese Honeysuckle) \n\nMy hair has never felt better. My waves are pronounced and soft. I will continue to wash once a week until my hair finishes transitioning and Ill update later on. Ill also be trying honey masks soon.\n This shampoo is easily a DIY as well if you don't want to buy it. The ingredients could all be bought in bulk for cheap\n\n\nJust wanted to provide another story for people looking for different options!",

From time to time, play with new products and things to see how they work for you.",

    "body": "**About:**\n\nThe [ACO Sun Ultra Light Face Fluid SPF 50+](https://media.apotea.se/product-images/XL/aco-sun-ultra-light-face-fluid-spf-50-40-ml-0.jpg) sunscreen is one of the most recent products from ACO. It's described as a hydrating, ultra light suncream for the face. According to ACO, it contains hyaluronic acid, protects against UVA and UVB, it's invisible on the skin, mattifying and dry touch, water and sweat resistent, and suitable for sensitive skin. 40 ml currently costs about 190 SEK / £15.40 / €18.37. It's available in Sweden, and I'd assume in most of Scandinavia. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n> Aqua, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Tris-Biphenyl Triazine (nano), Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Silica, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, \"1,2-Hexanediol\", Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis-Ethylhexyl Hydroxydimethoxy Benzylmalonate, Sarcosine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Decyl Glucoside, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Disodium Phosphate, Sodium Benzoate \n\n**My experiences:**\n\nI've worn this a couple of times and I can definitely tell it's by ACO. The consistently reminds me of their other products, though this is more liquid and similar to the Eucerin Sensitive Sun Fluid SPF 50+. It's unscented (excellent) and feels gentle on the skin. I don't experience any itching or stickiness, once it's dried down, which takes about 5-10 minutes. It's not shiny, but I'd say it's dewy until it's dried down. I'd also say it's decently sweatproof as I haven't noticed it pearling around my lips, which many sunscreens do because I sweat a lot and easily.\n\nI learned quickly to take the lid off, put my finger over the spout tip and *then* shake it. If you shake it with the lid on, it will dribble sunscreen on you when you unscrew the cap. Putting it on can be a little sticky; it's a very runny product, but it feels tacky against my skin at first and creates a fair bit of friction as you put it on. I often feel like I'm working in a much thicker product than what I have on my hands. I have rosacea and normal-to-dry skin. This doesn't make my rosacea flair, but it does create a white cast along any dry spots or healing acne, and if I don't work it in thoroughly for a bit more time than feels necessary.\n\nI'm pale as a ghost, and this is probably the first time I've experienced a white cast. My *summer* shades are MAC NW15 and NARS Sheer Glow in Mont Blanc, which should hopefully tell you how pale I am. In winter, I'd say KVD LockIt 42, Maybeline Dream Urban Cover in 095 fair porcelain and Maybeline FitMe Matte & Poreless in 101 are closer to my shades. To have a sunscreen create a whitecast on me is a feat, is what I'm saying. If you have a deeper skin tone, either be prepared to work this in thoroughly, or use another sunscreen.\n\n**Verdict**\n\n6/10. \n\nNot the worst, but not the best. I'll probably finish off the tube, then return to using EVY Daily Defense Face Mousse SPF 50 for my morning base layer of sunscreen.",

        "body": "I've had a *much* more positive experience! \n\nI have rosacea-prone, very fair, combo skin that's oily in summer, and I have extremely sensitive and dry eyes. Most of the time, sunscreens don't work for me because they are either flaring up my rosacea, irritating my eyes or are too tacky. \n\nThis sunscreen didn't irritate my skin or eyes at all, and for me it doesn't leave *any* white cast and also not on my boyfriend (he's in the medium NARS shade range). I only notice a slight cast for the first minute, as I am rubbing it in, but that's it. It feels very comfortable for me, like a lightweight cream that's easy to spread (similar to LRP anthelios in texture) and doesn't accentuate any flakes. \n\nIt's dewy to begin, but after about 10/15 minutes, it sets into a satin/natural finish - neither matte nor dewy. I *hate* a tacky finish and to me this doesn't have one at all (once set). I would describe the feeling as soft/moisturised, but not sticky. It's lightweight to the extent that I never consciously think about it on my face (and my hair won't stick to it, etc.), but it's also not like alcohol-heavy sunscreens that feel imperceptible on the skin. \n\nI also do a lot of outdoor swimming in summer and this stuff is pretty good at staying on, and I have never tanned or burned with ACO SPFs (their cosmetic elegance varies, but the ingredients in their chemical SPF 30s/50s are in my experience really great).",

I don't understand why my scalp is still dry and itchy when it's supposed to soothe me with all the nourishing ingredients. I also have a bad habit of scalp picking due to severe anxiety (that I'm trying hard to cut), I know tea tree is drying as the small portion of spillage on my forehead is dry....    \n\n\n\nI used to use coconut oil as a hair mask but I stopped cause I can't stand the smell and it's so hard to get out too. I had to shampoo 3x and then my scalp would be dry again ugh.    \n\n\n\nI can't find the products recommended for dry sensitive scalp in my local drugstores so I buy products with similar ingredients cheap and accessible to me.    \n\n\n\nQuestion 1 : does this mean tea tree doesn't work for me? A lot of the recommended conditioners have all these ingredients of the petal fresh, this brand is really cheap and accessible to me too. Where did it go wrong?    \n\n\nQuestion 2 : the products recommendations page recommended tresemme naturals conditioner but It was discontinued and I read reviews that says it has to be used as a leave in and not a rinse conditioner. That baffled me! How do I know it's if a rinse or leave in?    \n\n   \n\nQuestion 3 : I plan on buying the sukin protein conditioner, is this okay?    \n\n\nWater (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Actinidia Chinensis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract (Nettle), Arctium Lappa Root Extract (Burdock), Equisetum Arvense Extract (Horsetail), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil (Rose Hip), Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Citrus Nobili   \n\nI got a lot of help last time.

I use one pump, twice a day, and when it comes in contact with water, it generates just the right amount of beautiful foam.  It is super easy to rinse off, nothing lingers behind.  My skin feels refreshed and clean but not dried out.\n\n**Results:**  I fell in love.  This is my holy grail cleanser, hands down.  It helps my skin retain moisture and cleanses without aggravating redness.  And a huge bonus for me is that it smells like lavender, but I know that isn't for everyone.\n\n**Packaging:**  Standard plastic bottle and pump.  Nothing remarkable in that aspect.\n\n**Repurchase?**  Already did!  I've had a bottle on stand-by since July because I kept thinking I'd run out faster than I actually did.

I have chronic topical allergies which means extremely sensitive skin, and to date this is the ONLY cleanser that hasn't irritated it, provoked acne and/or dried out my face. \n\nSadly it appears that it's no longer being sold; the only trustworthy looking website carrying it and shipping to the U.S is for some reason not accepting orders. And the company's website has vanished from the internet. \n\nI'm DEVASTATED. I need a new cleanser ASAP. So far I've discovered that my skin hates any kind of alcohol, sodium chloride, any fragrances, and any weird essential oils. Typically if a product has a long ingredients list.. it's going to upset my skin. \n\nThe ingredients in my original cleanser were as follows: \n\nWater, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\nIt also had a perfect 5.5 PH value. I tried Native's vegan alcohol free cleanser but the PH must've been off because it immediately made my skin oily. I also looked into Vanicream but saw people saying that the PH is in the 6-7 range, a range I have had a bad experience with :( Plus both of those contain sodium chloride.. \n\nIf anyone can help me find a dupe or something similar to TVG's I greatly appreciate it! Since no longer being able to buy it, my skin has rapidly deteriorated..",

I wanted to share a tool I've been using to find dupe products or products without ingredients that are troublesome for me.  \n\nINCI Decoder: https://incidecoder.com/  \n\nHow to use:  \n\n1. Leave the search box blank (in order to capture all cleansers, since they could be named \"cleanser,\" \"wash,\" or even creative names like \"Swipe Clean\" (by Bybi)). Just click the magnifying glass.  \n\n2. Under \"Must Contain All Of These Ingredients,\" type the names of your favorite products' ingredients and select them from the autocomplete window.  \n\n3. Under \"Must Not Contain Any Of These Ingredients,\" enter any ingredients that you don't want.  \n\n4. Click \"Filter\" and you will get a list of matching products, sometimes spanning multiple pages.  \n\n5. Sometimes nothing matches the exact ingredients list you provided. To loosen the filters, click on the \"X\" next to any ingredients in the \"Must Contain\" box.  \n\nI've been using this tool for years. And even though I still struggle with cleansers, INCI Decoder has helped me find niche ingredient products that I otherwise would never have found on Google. A lot of them end up being from Canada or Europe, like Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands. I repeatedly find vegan and cruelty free as well as fragrance free and so-called hypoallergenic products from those countries. Again, products that my English Google searches likely would have missed. So it's an amazing tool. But the database only has products entered by users.  \n\nI went ahead and searched for a cleanser fitting some of your criteria:  \n\nErhalogy (or Erha21) Skin Barrier Facial Wash (I substituted cocamidopropyl betaine for lauramidopropyl betaine)  \n \nEtude House Cica Balance 5.5 Foam Cleanser (lacks a few thickeners and humectants from the Vegan Glow cleanser)\n\nRael Daily Detox Oil to Foam Gentle Cleanser (has olive oil and quite a few plant extracts, which might not be desired)  \n\nYou can also make the following substitutions of similar ingredients:  \n-lauramidopropyl betaine: cocamidopropyl betaine, coco-betaine  \n-decyl glucoside: coco glucoside, lauryl glucoside, caprylyl/capryl glucoside  \n-1,2-hexanediol: propylene glycol, propanediol, caprylyl glycol, pentylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol  \n-sodium cocoyl isethionate: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium cocoyl methyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate  \n\n\nGood luck and hope you find a dupe cleanser!  \n\nETA: I'm unfamiliar with the products mentioned above, so their vegan and cruelty free status needs to be confirmed with the vendor. Beyond the vendor I would also check Cruelty Free Kitty's database. Some companies lie about or use ambiguous language to claim that they don't test on animals (but then still do in countries like China, for example). Cruelty Free Kitty audits companies for truly cruelty free practices.",

I’m lucky in that I can get away with Crest’s regular paste but almost nothing else for toothpaste. I also use dawn dishsoap. On a side note, I can’t use it because of bad reactions to vinegar, but if vinegar doesn’t bother you, 1 part dishsoap 1 part cleaning/white vinegar can be used to clean all kinds of things like the shower or sinks, and vinegar can be used for laundry soap. If it doesn’t bother you, definitely look up using vinegar for cleaning etc.\n\nEdit: forgot one, I use Aveeno ultra calming facewash for sensitive skin.

It would be very surprising for a BB to be below pH 4, it's probably somewhere between 5 and 7 (roughly).\n\nI'd put on the sunscreen first, let it dry, and then the BB.

You'd have to use at least 1/4 tsp of BB to get the listed amount of sun protection, which will look cakey as hell, and SPF 10 really isn't adequate sun protection.",

I've been working on my routine for a while now and had finally made some great progress with hydration, but was having trouble finding a cleanser I liked that didn't feel stripping. I tried double cleansing for a while, and used Banila Co Clean It Zero as my first cleanser - I liked it, but it seemed to break me out without using a second cleanser, and doing that always felt drying. Some second cleansers I tried included Hada Labo foaming, Hada Labo hydrating, Cerave hydrating, and Vanicream - none of them were terrible (except for Cerave, but I've since figured out that my skin hates niacinamide), but all felt at least a little bit drying. \n\nI had changed up some parts of my routine after learning about fungal acne and suspecting I might have it, so I went to Simpleskincarescience's [fungal acne post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) to look for cleanser recs as I hadn't really paid attention to them before. That's where I came across this:\n\n[Create Cosmetics 5 Elements Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M9AC3OK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8)\n\nThis stuff is amazing! Only 5 ingredients, and one of them is glycolic acid. I was worried this would make it irritating, but it's only 2%, and my skin has done fine with it (YMMV of course, if you have sensitive skin or have reacted badly to acids before you should patch test!). The other ingredients are water, decyl glucoside (a gentle surfactant), glycerin, and sclerotium gum (a thickener). \n\nI'm almost through my first bottle and have already ordered a second. This stuff is mildly exfoliating yet still somehow non-irritating and non-drying, and is able to remove my sunscreen and/or makeup without a first cleanser. I'm so impressed and happy that I've been able to find something that works so well with so few ingredients and at a decent price ($14.50 for 8oz on Amazon - not the best price ever, but not terrible).  I haven't seen it mentioned on here so I thought I'd give it some love and let anyone who's looking for a new gentle cleanser know that this one is worth a shot!\n\nMy current routine:\n\nAM:\n\n- Thayer's witch hazel \n- Cezanne skin conditioner high moist (another under-mentioned product IMO!)\n- Hada Labo perfect gel cream \n- TO azelaic acid 10% \n- Rohto Skin Aqua UV super moisture milk \n\nPM:\n\n- Create Cosmetics 5 Elements Cleanser \n- TO glycolic acid 7% (twice a week)\n- Cezanne skin conditioner high moist \n- TO granactive retionoid 2% in squalane (twice a week, not on the same nights as the glycolic acid, new addition to routine)\n- Hada Labo perfect gel cream \n- Squalane \n",

    "body": "**Introduction**  \nTom Busby is a guy over at the forum [rosaceagroup.org](https://rosaceagroup.org/). He has researched skin conditions, mainly seborrheic dermatitis and malasezzia related skin conditions, for years and he has cured his life long condition through his homemade lotions and cleansers. Through the years he has shared his recipes and research on the forums, mainly in his own thread where he goes over different treatments and his own experiences: [Link](https://rosaceagroup.org/The_Rosacea_Forum/showthread.php?28667-Seborrheic-Dermatitis-amp-Folliculitis-Review-of-OTC-Treatments-for-Malassezia) The whole thread is worth a read\n\nNow that he has years of experimenting and experience behind him he doesn't believe his formulas will change, and he has also started selling his products. You can contact him through email or wait until he sets up his own website to sell his products, which he said will happen in a couple of months.\n\nEach product cost 35$ + shipping. I've been using them for just over a week, not really long enough to write a proper review, so this is more of a first impressions post. I'll try to keep it pretty brief, so just ask questions below if you want to know anything.\n\n**The Lotion**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Caprylic/capric triglycerides, Niacinamide & dl-Panthenol (proVitamins), Glycerin, Olive Squalane oil, Cetearyl alcohol 30/70 NF (thickener), Sodium Hyaluronate, HMW, & Ceramide complex, (skin quality improve-ment), Ceteareth 20 & Glyceryl stearate (emulsifiers), Toco-phersolan & Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Climbazole (anti-fungal), Microcrystalline wax, OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, & Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nA ton of great ingredients, climbazole working as an antifungal and piroctone olamine working as an antifungal and also against demodex. No oils which malasezzia can metabolize and also a ton of other great ingredients for general skin improvement.\n\nThe lotion is a bit runny, which makes it very easy to spread across the face. It's a bit oily at first,  but it soaks great into the skin and dries pretty matte. It has no perfume, it smells a bit of alcohol. It isn't as moisturizing as for example cerave cream or other rich moisturizer, but it works great for my skin. Thick moisturizer makes my skin all shiny and breaks me out, this leaves my skin feeling like I am wearing nothing. I've tried dozens of moisturizers over the years, and even without thinking about the antifungals, this is probably the best moisturizer I've tried. I just need a little bit to cover my entire face and because of the large bottle this will probably last for months.\n\n**The shampoo**  \nIngredients:  \nDistilled water, Decyl glucoside, Cocobetaine, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium lauryol lactylate, (surfactants), Niacinamide and dl-Panthenol (pro-Vitamins), Olive Squalane oil, Sodium hyaluronate, HMW, and Ceramide complex, (skin quality improvement), Tocophersolan and Retinyl palmitate (Vitamins E & A), Piroctone olamine (anti-demodectic), Acrylates C10-30 cross-polymer, Climbazole (anti-fungal), Citric acid, Di-PPG-2 myreth-10 adipate (solubilizer), OptiMSM, Isopropanol, Glyceryl caprylate, Methylene blue, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic acid, and Dehydroacetic acid (preservatives). 5.5 pH\n\nThis also contains a ton of great ingredients and no bad oils. I just use it as a foaming facial cleanser. It foams up pretty well, and it has a low pH. Because it is a foaming cleanser it is a bit drying, so using it without the moisturizer is probably a bad idea.\n\n**How to use and results**  \nReading Tom's posts at the forums he has some guidelines on how to use the products. Once a day I wet my face in the sink, then I foam up the cleanser and rub it into my face. Then i wait a few minutes and step into the shower and properly rinse it of. When i step out of the shower i tap-dry my face and apply the lotion on my face.\n\nFrom the first day my face started to shed dead skin. A lot of white flakes appeared on the center of my face and beard area. This might sound worrying, but according to Tom this is great. He is an older guy, so it took him over 5 months for his skin to return to normal, but because I am pretty young I should expect faster results. My skin seems to get less flaky every day, and i just rub the flakes of with my fingers and apply more moisturizer if they are visible.\n\nMy skin is less red and the products also seem to work well for my acne. It remains to be seen how the products work long term, but right now I am happy to have a solid routine that should kill of the fungus on my face causing my seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0acvbn1a1721.jpg?width=3336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d824cd13feea43386925fe49c5793cb62db4cb6c",

        "body": "Great thorough review SelectAge.\n\nI bought the lotion and shampoo at the same time as SelectAge (after SelectAges post here on /r/sebderm that Tom had started selling it) and have also been using it for a week. At first I noticed, just like SelectAge, my skin flaking but also my face turned red. But both of these symptoms are supposed to be good since it is a natural reaction for your skin as the skin is fighting the sebderm. After a couple of days my skin has gotten less and less red and flaky. \n\nI'm also pretty young (27) so I expect my skin to react faster than Tom's did. Also he added an ingredient since he used it that he thinks may make it 25% faster than it was for him.\n\nMy routine is just like SelectAge, I mostly use it for my face, but sometimes I use the shampoo for my hair/top body as well but I don't use it often enough to review how good it works on my scalp. It doesn't bug me as much as the sebderm on my face.\n\nAs SelectAge said, it is a good idea to use the shampoo as a cleanser before applying the moisturizer to thoroughly cleanse your skin before putting on the lotion.\n\nIt feels like I am just repeating everything SelectAge has said already, but I will also keep updating how it goes for me. Hopefully I will know for sure in just a month or two if it going in the right direction for me:)\n\nIf you are interested in this product I'd suggest you read up a lot on Tom's research and then contact Tom on either the forum or through his mail which I think is accessible through his post which is posted on 4th of december in the forum thread which SelectAge linked. He has a 'product information file' which he sent me so I'd suggest you ask Tom for it if you are interested. I don't want to share it here without asking Tom so I'd suggest you just ask Tom for it:)\n\nHopefully we'll both get better and better SelectAge *hopeful*",

When you start using an anti-fungal the immune system becomes aware of the fungal invaders and the symptoms flare up. After around 10 days of treatment the flaking is now very minimal, but redness, especially in the inner cheek region, which in first seemed to decrease, is now a bit worse. I have been kind of scrubbing the shampoo into my face, so I am going to try applying it a bit more gently in case the redness is just normal skin irritation.   \n\n\nI've experienced the same increase in redness when using antifungals like lotrimin ultra and terbinafine previously, so I am not really worried, and still optimistic about the treatment. The initial increase in flaking should be an indication that the product is working, an increase in redness is also to be expected. Curious to see if the redness will eventually fade.",

I still have the Kale-alu-yAHA Toner in my stash to be used sometime this summer/fall though. Other than that I have reviewed everything from the line and the hits have been the Beet Shield and Great Barrier Relief. One miss (for me) was the Oat So Simple Water Cream…and I’m sorry to say this cleanser is another.\n\nThe Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser is a thick/jelly-like water based cleanser that focuses on mild cleansing while imparting some hydration to the skin. Featured ingredients here include Green Tea Leaf Water, Green Tea Leaf Powder, Hemp Seed Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Oat Kernel Extract, and Soapbark Extract. There are little “bits” of what I think is the Green Tea Leaf Powder floating around in the jelly here and there…which ads to the interesting look of this amber/green jelly.\n\nMy first impressions of this cleanser were pretty positive. I was intrigued by the texture…and that was only heightened when I applied it to damp skin. This jelly doesn’t really “break down” in water right away like a typical water based cleanser. Rather, it almost smoothes out and creates a really slippery/slidery (LOL) layer that is actually kind of fun to play with. After about 10-15 seconds or so…the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser does foam up slightly and become more “traditional” in style. \n\nEven with the lower amount of foam or lather, I found this cleanser to be decent at removing any residual impurities left behind by my first step cleanser (or by itself in my AM routine). I even began taking to adding just a bit of this to a whip maker that I use…creating a much more intense lather. I usually only did this in my AM routine as that is when I take a shower (and the whip maker lives in the shower/I’m too lazy to grab it at night). Either way, I got pretty much the same result with both methods. \n\nAlthough I didn’t really feel like this cleanser was “hydrating” my skin…it didn’t feel like it was drying or stripping in any way. That was until about two-three weeks into the trial.\n\nI began to notice a slight dry/tight feeling around my jaw line and forehead after using the Match Hemp Hydrating Cleanser after a few weeks. It wasn’t an all at once/glaring problem, but maybe just after my AM routine and then a day or two later in my PM routine…I just felt like I couldn’t even make it to my actives or toner without feeling kind of dry. Of course other factors play in to the inconsistency…some days I had just exfoliated the night before and others I had maybe used a poor sunscreen during the day (hi Cell Fusion!). But where other pH balanced/gentle cleansers dont intensify the effect…over time the Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser did.\n\nBy then end of my trial I was really looking forward to moving this cleanser out of my routine. I don’t want to knock or “ call out” the scent here…but I am. Krave Beauty doesn’t use synthetic fragrance and this product is essential oil free as well which is honestly a great thing. But the scent that does come through (for me) is kind of “industrial” in a way LOL…I guess kind of like plastic. Its not unbearable by any means, but for me it wasn’t great. Each time I used this product I looked back to my time with the Sulwhasoo Snowise EX Brightening Cleansing Foam as a very fond (although essential oil filled) memory. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zlo3kanmt41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d081566bd104fc2e56f887caadc25376a7cb09b8\n\nAside from all of that (results, scent)…I think I just have to come clean and say I don’t think these thicker/jelly style cleansers are for me in general. I wrote my review of the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel in 2018 and going back to it now I was shocked by how similar my review of that product was compared to what you’ve just read. “Texture is thick/unique, smells okay, made my skin dry after a while…”…literally the same flow and talking points (although I hope I have improved my skincare review game in that time). \n\nSo, I’m not sure what it is. I could try cutting back to only one water cleanse a day or maybe I need to change how much I use (about a large pea sized amount…which probably only makes sense in my head LOL). Or, maybe the formulation of these thicker water based cleansers just doesn’t agree with my skin for whatever reason. Regardless, I just don’t see myself coming back to this product or being able to wholeheartedly recommend it. I have one more (actually two since I bought it during a 1+1 sale on Jolse) cleanser that from what I’ve seen matches this style…its the OneOSeven Low pH Chaga Cleanser and I’m hoping it will change my mind.\n\nAnyone looking for a gentle and effective hydrating cleanser with the added boost of antioxidants/calming (which the Matcha/Green Tea in this Krave Beauty cleanser offers) should really check out the Youth To The People Superfood Cleanser. To me, it is superior in nearly every way. I found that product to be very gentle and hydrating to the point that it almost doubled as a toner for me. The consistency, texture when lathering, and application were also much more my style (decent amount of lather from a thinner product). And, the fresh cut greenery/refreshing scent is really something special. All of that in a product that costs just slightly more per oz than the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.\n\nI hear so many people rave about this product and it feels so wrong to go against the grain here. But I felt the same way about the Then I Met You cleanser…not for me.\n\nFull Ingredients List: \n\nCamellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Water, Glycerin, Coco-Betaine, Methyl Gluceth-10, Ethoxydiglycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Sodium Chloride, Butoxydiglycol, Diglycerin, Glycereth-26, Xanthan Gum, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Diethoxydiglycol, Coco-Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Decyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Octanediol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium PCA, Disodium EDTA\n\nWhere To Buy (Krave Beauty Site $16.00 USD): [https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser](https://kravebeauty.com/collections/shop-all/products/matcha-hemp-hydrating-cleanser)",

I still don’t have pilling problems on its own or under foundation, and I still don’t think it’s *awful*.\n\nI used to buy these in bulk and resell on eBay and there have been a couple different packaging styles; the oldest one had the 5 star UVA circle on the front instead of the “High UVA and UVB protection \\ Fragrance free - Non sticky” and had expiration dates, and the barcode was stickered on over a NOT FOR SALE box that was often sharpied over. The barcode sticker was blue inside when peeled off.\n\nSecond version started looking how it currently looks on the amazon product photos https://imgur.com/a/ivUQrfB and they removed expiration dates, having only batch numbers stamped in the top.\n\nNewest version with a new formulation looks exactly the same from the front, only the text on the back has changed, and expiration dates are back.

    "body": "I recently decided to switch shampoos because I wanted to get away from sulfates and other harsh ingredients that might have been stripping my hair. After doing some research on here, I decided to try SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo. I checked the ingredients list in the product reviews here just to make sure there wasn't anything in it that could potentially be a problem, and I didn't see anything, so I went ahead and purchased it. \n\nThis morning, however, I noticed that on the label on the bottle I bought, one of the first couple of ingredients is Decyl Glucoside, and in parentheses after that it says Coconut Oil. This is different from the ingredient list in the product review on this subreddit and from the ingredient list on the websites of a few retailers, which have Sugar Beets listed in parentheses after the Decyl Glucoside. I checked wikipedia, which claims that this particular ingredient is indeed derived from coconuts, but there is no mention of sugar beets.\n\nI don't think that I've ever used a product with coconut oil on my hair before, but I have used coconut oil on my face and it did cause breakouts, so I tend to avoid it anywhere near my skin if it all possible. I've also used a shampoo that contained some ingredient that broke me out wherever the ends of my hair touched my face, neck, and back, so I have to be careful what I use in my hair because it will also impact my face. This has prompted a few questions about Decyl Glucoside in my shampoo.\n\n1. Why is there a discrepancy between the product review here/the ingredients list on select retail sites and the actual label? Have they reformulated their shampoo and the information here and on certain retail sites just hasn't been updated? Should I look for a bottle that has sugar beets instead of coconut oil in parentheses?\n2. Can Decyl Glucoside be derived from different sources, including sugar beets, or if I see this ingredient, can I automatically assume that it is indeed either coconut oil or derived from coconut oil?\n3. Should I still give this shampoo a chance, or is this ingredient commonly known to break people out who have had problems with coconut oil on their skin?\n4. If I have to avoid this product because of the Decyl Glucoside, can anyone recommend a similar product that doesn't contain that ingredient?",

So the comedogenicity of coconut oil is not contributed by decyl glucoside. I don't know if you can derive decyl glucoside from sugar beets. \n\nI don't see why not give the product a try?

    "body": "Hello everybody :) this is my first post but i will try to respond to as many people as i can.I find the 'octocrylene' ALWAYS stings my eyes, so i tried to avoid it and - dam,dam, dam- i have now found that chemical sunscreens no longer stings my eyes :DI ussually end up buying tinosorb based sunscreens and they never sting my eyes :DBeware that if tinosorb M is the main filter instead of tinosorb S it can give off a slight white cast.\n\n**Short reviews** (tested on dry. pale skin around super sensitive eyes)**:**\n\nNon-eye-stinging sunscreens i have tried so far (all spf 50 and fragrance-free)- they were all tested very cose to the eyes (like i often get some on my lower lashes y accident) :\n\nsunscreens where the first sunfilter is **tinosorb M** (all have a slight white cast):\n\n\\- Ducray - melascreen spf 50+ dry touch- avene Sun spray kids spf 50+Overview: both look white coming out of the tube and leave a slight white cast n my pale skin (ginger here).\n\nSunsreens where first sunfilter is **Tinosorb S**:- La Roche-possay Anthelios Ultra (for sensitive eyes)- Derma SPF 50 'sollotion' (sunlotion)Overview: these are both slightly oily and sticky, they are yellow coming out - i think tinosorb s might be the reason. (they have ZERO cast)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAveneis not gonna work if you use it as a spray since it creates nothing like a mist but more of a 'splater' on the skin. It feels like a dry oil when you rob it in but it does not absorb as well as an oil, it leaves a clear sheen to the skin :/\n\nDucraycomes ou ike a light white cream. It does not dry down oily nor matte. it would be more suitable for normal to dry skin, but does as i said leave a slight white cast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLa Roche-possay UltraCome out of the tupe looking yellow it has ZERO white cast\\*. It does however leave a barely noticable yellow tint on pale skin (no prob. for non-vampires :P..). It is looks shiny and it does not dry - EVER. It balls up if you apply powder over it, so no chance to mattefy it :/\n\nDermaThis is not available to most of you since it is a local brand. It de dry down a bit but but it still looks greasy :/If they make a spf 50 for the face it might be better but spf 30 is too low in the summer for me.  \n\\*(It sound like it leaves a cast on deeper skin tones see comment by 'whyiskalegross')\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think i will test the La roche-possay anthelios **shaka fluid** out next because it is suppose to be non-sticky and non-oily. I have no idea how my dry skin will react to the high amounts of alcohol but hopefully it will be better than the ones i have :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIngredientlists:Tinosorb S = Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl TriazineTinosorb M =  Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Avene|Ducray|La-roche-possay - extra|Derma|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

    "body": "**Bioderma Photoderm LEB SPF 30 / UVA 30**\n\nI have seen this product recommended on this sub once or twice, but I couldn’t find any other reviews on this product other than the 2 which are on Makeupalley.  So I would like to review this product and give a summary of what I have learned about European sunscreens in general.\n\nAfter doing all this sunscreen research, I decided that I want the best UVA protection that I can get.  That means looking to Europe to get some high-quality sunscreens.  Here is a [reminder chart about UVB/UVA](http://imgur.com/VO5B0FE) which shows that year-round, even indoors, UVA is reaching you.  European sunscreens don’t always advertise the UVA protection value. In the EU, you will see the SPF number (which indicates UVB protection) and you will probably see [the letters UVA with a circle around it](http://imgur.com/VGlep5d). This means that the UVA protection is at least 1/3 of the SPF number.  Bioderma is one of the only brands I have seen which advertises the UVA protection.\n \nI was in Europe a few months ago and I was very confused about how to read the ingredient lists.  The active ingredients are not separated from the inactive ingredients and they are listed under their INCI names instead of their common names.  I made a table below of common active ingredients and their other names, plus some other relevant information. If you have any additions or corrections for the table, let me know!\n\n\nTrade Name | Other Names | INCI Name | Protects against | UV absorption\n---|---|----|----|----\nParsol 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517 | Avobenzone | Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane | UVA | maximum of 357 nm\nMexoryl SX | Ecamsule | terephthalylidene dicamphor sulfonic acid |  | \nMexoryl XL |  | Drometrizole trisiloxane | UVA, UVB| two absorption peaks: one at 303 nm (UVB) and one at 344 nm (UVA)\nTinosorb S | Bemotrizinol | bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazin | UVA, UVB | \nTinosorb M | Bisoctrizole | methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol | UVA, UVB | \nUvinul T 150 |  | Ethylhexyl triazone | UVB | Maximum of 314 nm\nUvinul A Plus |  | Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate | UVA | Maximum of 354 nm\n\n\t\n\n**Ingredients for Bioderma Photoderma LEB spray** (I have written the common name into brackets for the active ingredients):\n\nAqua/water/eau, dicaprylyl carbonate, diisopropyl sebacate, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol [Tinosorb M], butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane [Avobenzone], bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine [Tinosorb S], cyclopentasiloxane, methylpropanediol, decyl glucoside, ectoin, mannitol, xylitol, rhamnose, fructooligosaccharides, laminaria ochroleuca extract, c20-22 alkyl phosphate, c20-22 alcohols, microcrystalline cellulose, coco-glucoside, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, pentylene glycol, propylene glycol, cetearyl alcohol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, sodium hydroxide, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, chlorphenesin.

SPF 30 / UVA 30 as the optimal ratio for sun allergies.\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* Alcohol-free and fragrance-free \n\n* $25-30 to import from France\n\n* Available on Amazon and [French Cosmetics for Less](http://www.frenchcosmeticsforless.com/proddetail.php?prod=734503&cat=112)\n\n* 125 mL bottle\n\n* Photostable\n\n**My review:**\n\nIt comes in a pump spray bottle.  I found that 10 sprays are equal to 1/4 teaspoon, which makes it very easy to apply without bringing out the measuring spoon every time I use it.  It is a thin liquid which is easy to rub into my skin.  It feels very light when applied. I was surprised to see that there was a little white cast, considering that it doesn’t contain any physical sunscreen. However, after using this a few times, I have decided that the white cast isn’t that bad if you make sure to blend it in properly. If you don’t rub it in, you will be left with white streaks. If I use it on my eyelids, for example, I get obvious white creases.  It does leave a sheen, but I wouldn’t say that it’s greasy. My skin does get shiny on its own, so it's hard to tell. Overall, I am happy to find a light, non-greasy sunscreen that comes in a 125 mL bottle.  I will admit that I’ve only used this for 4 days, but I think it’s enough to make a fair assessment.  I have enjoyed using it so far.  I took a few photos, which may be helpful. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/wdNlT).\n\n**Some other sunscreens I have tried for comparison:**\n\n* Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector Broad Spectrum SPF 42 For Face. Perhaps the only truly matte sunscreen I’ve ever used.  A thin liquid which applied easily, but left a white cast.  I loved the matte look, wasn’t crazy about the white cast, and I could tolerate the fragrance. However, I was concerned about the long-term effects of using a product with so much alcohol in it.\n\n* Shiseido Urban Environment UV Protection Cream Broad Spectrum SPF 40 For Face/Body. Similar to the version for face, but this is a cream.  It left both a white cast and sometimes a sheen to my skin.\n\n* EltaMD UV Daily Broad-Spectrum SPF 40. Fragrance-free and alcohol-free is why I initially chose it.  I love how light and pleasant this feels, though there can be a bit of a sheen to it. Virtually no white cast. I emailed EltaMD about the PPD value, but they did not respond.  They have said previously that all of their sunscreens have a PPD of 8-16.\n\n* Vichy Capital Soleil Dry Touch Face Emulsion SPF 50 [European Version]. I almost considered doing a separate review for this, but for several reasons I will not write a full review. First, I can’t find much information online, so I think this has been discontinued and a SPF 30 version is in its place? It is a thick cream which is absorbed quickly. It has a velvety feel on my skin.  While it is not truly matte, it is not greasy and gives my skin a “glow”. It is alcohol-free and leaves no white cast at all. However, it has a VERY strong perfume in it.  It fades after an hour or two. The fragrance something I neither love nor hate. I also couldn’t find an exact PPD value for this, although it should be at least 16+.\n\n* Garnier Amber Solaire Sensitive Advanced Sensitive Advanced Protection SPF 50+. Unfortunately, this is the only sunscreen I took home from Europe.  I very much disliked it and I don’t think it really deserves to be reviewed. It has a strong, off-putting plastic smell to it.  It leaves my face extremely shiny.  It feels heavy and greasy on my skin, even my arms, and makes me feel hot and sweaty when I put it on. It was, however, only 7 Euros for 200 mL and I now use it for the backs of my hands several times per day.\n\nIf you have any questions, just ask!  \n",

    "body": "Hi Skincare addiction!\n\nI've been reading many of the threads here and since I appreciate so much the wealth of info I wanted to share with you my quest for the (as close to) perfect sunscreen, hoping that it will be useful.\n\nA bit of background: I'm a fair blonde Spaniard in my 30s with oily, sensitive skin (please excuse my English, btw). Won't bore you with how many sunscreens I've tried in my life that haven't made it for me, and being pale in this sunny country, believe me- I've tried many. I thought I had found my HG in Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Face Sunscreen SPF 50/ PA+++ last year but, despite some sources stating that alcohol content might not be so bad for skin in a well-formulated formula, I still wanted to find something that was alcohol, fragrance and nasty stuff free, especially since one is supposed to wear sunscreen EVERYDAY. I'm far from a skincare expert but after a bit of research I decided that, even if the EWG lists have some very nice options, I wanted to find a European sunscreen, as some of the chemicals used here are proven to be safer and more effective (Tinosorbs, etc.), and UVA protection better. But of course, most of these products are not as thoroughly reviewed or not reviewed at all in places like EWG, so there started my quest. My biggest problem with the \"adult\" versions of brands like Bioderma, Avène or La Roche-Posay sunscreens was the fragrance content. But finally, I found this (links in Spanish and French, product is not available in English-speaking countries, but the name and picture will do for those of you who might want to get it shipped from France). Mind you, this is the newest formulation (last year's had still fragrance and parabens in it):\n\nhttp://www.eau-thermale-avene.es/solares/solar-pieles-sensibles/gama-naranja/leche-spf-50-ninos-100-ml-0\n\nhttp://www.eau-thermale-avene.fr/solaire/protection-solaire/peaux-sensibles-sensitive-protection/lait-spf-50-enfant\n\nThis is the composition:\n\nAVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA). C12-15 ALKYL BENZOATE. DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE. METHYLENE BIS-BENZOTRIAZOLYL TETRAMETHYLBUTYLPHENOL [NANO]. WATER (AQUA). GLYCERIN. BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE. DIETHYLHEXYL BUTAMIDO TRIAZONE. DIISOPROPYL ADIPATE. BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE. CETEARYL ISONONANOATE. LAURYL GLUCOSIDE. POLYGLYCERYL-2 DIPOLYHYDROXYSTEARATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. BENZOIC ACID. CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE. CAPRYLYL GLYCOL. CITRIC ACID. DISODIUM EDTA. GLYCERYL BEHENATE. GLYCERYL DIBEHENATE. HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES. HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL GLYCERIDES. POLYACRYLATE-13. POLYISOBUTENE. POLYSORBATE 20. PROPYLENE GLYCOL. SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE. TOCOPHEROL. TOCOPHERYL GLUCOSIDE. TRIBEHENIN. XANTHAN GUM.\n\nNo parabens, no fragrance, safe blockers, hypoallergenic, non comedogenic. I've run the ingredient list both through the Beautypedia and the EWG database and all products seem safe (perhaps savvier redditters can correct me if I'm wrong). All of them. I'm delighted. Not sure why it is rated only so-so in Avène's French page as there are no comments, but seems good to me! Just to make sure I wasn't getting anything nasty I googled reviews in other French webpages (avis) and it's well reviewed. \n\nNow for wearability: I like it A LOT. It doesn't leave a white cast and it's not oily. It absorbs easily and (so far) hasn't made me break out. I've been using it on face and neck for the past days and so far so good. I like the texture a lot. I don't wear foundation so I cannot tell how good it would work in combination but it's good friends with my moisturizer.\n\nI will update in the next weeks to let you know how it's doing, but it seems I might have finally found my HG sunscreen- one marketed for children! Hey, if it's good for them it should be good for me too :)\n\n",

But I believe the laws in Korea also have changed. That’s also why Skin1004‘s centella ampoule doesn’t contain only 100% centella asiatica extract anymore (it was never the case, they just need to disclose the other ingredients now too).\n\nThe ingredients list on Yesstyle is exactly the same as the one from Rossmann.\n\nI doubt they have different versions for Korea vs. EU/rest of the world (besides the USA).",

XANTHAN GUM\n\n**Special Info:** Comes in a convenient tube with a pump\n\n**Experience:** I ordered this one from Amazon because it was listed as fragrance-free. However, what I received was the fragranced version, and since it was a non-returnable product, I got in touch with Amazon, and they refunded the money and let me keep the product.\n\nRight off the bat, I found the fragrance too much for me. My skin is particularly not sensitive to fragrance, but I try to avoid fragranced products because there are certain smells that I just cannot stand and this is one of those. However, one of my friends said that she doesn’t find the smell like anything at all. Clearly, polarising opinions. So, it might not bother someone who doesn’t have a sensitive nose.\n\nThe texture, as the name suggests, is creamy albeit not super thick. Since I got to keep this product, I thought of using it anyway. The fragrance was really off-putting, but it does dissipate in 15 minutes and doesn’t linger around your nose at least. It has a tiny bit of white cast (probably because of the high percentage of Tinosorb M); however, nothing that a little bit of blending in will not solve. Even for my normal skin, it does feel a bit greasy and heavy; definitely not the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen. However, at no point did I feel suffocated because of it nor did I feel that it’s clogging my pores. \n\nAll in all, it’s a good sunscreen that offers you solid protection and is something that I would like to have with me when I am travelling, or for the days I know that I’ll be out and about. Yes, it’s not cheap per se, but for the protection it offers, I don’t mind the price at all. If only we had the fragrance free option available here, I would make this my go-to hardcore sunscreen. \n\nWRP intermittently",

Mild but cleansing, non-drying for a gel (more of a liquid texture). It’s blue in color due to the copper in it.\n\nDr. Eddie's Happy Cappy Medicated Shampoo\n\nI bit the bullet and ordered this from iHerb (expensive from where I am). It’s really good, I can use it on my face for a couple of minutes and still not get super dry. Calms down the small spots.

But I've used them on other body parts and ohboi do they feel soft. I've used them 3-4 times with 4-5 days in between and they have gotten rid of almost all bumpiness and even lightened a bit an old burn scar. \n\nIf you are interested, I recommend going to Primark as soon as possible, their prices are marked down so they will probably disappear soon from existence. \n\n\nNow, to the info:\n\n**Name:** Skin perfecting resurfacing pads.\n\n**Description on package:** Disques exfoliants. Glycolic acid & Hyaluronic acid. Refines & purifies.\n\n**Quantity:** 60 pads\n\n**Price:** 7€ at first, 3€ now.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n> Aqua (water), glycerin, glycolic acid, sodium hydroxide, polysorbate 20, silicone quaternium-17, sodium benzoate, ethylhexylglycerin, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) extract, decyl glucoside, panthenol, disodium edta, sodium hyaluronate, phenoxyethanol, benzoic acid, dehydroacetic acid.\n\n[On CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8754367767.html)\n\n[Picture of the product + other skincare thingies I bought](https://imgur.com/a/fOT9K3h)\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you ever look at the makeup/skincare section of Primark? Have you tried anything from them?",

I've been using superdrugs for about a year which are supposed to be a dupe for nip and fab (I haven't tried those), and these are nicer. They're slightly bigger and a fair bit softer. I saw slight results with superdrugs but more with these in the small amount of time I've been using them. \nMy skins super dry and dehydrated due to medication and these don't dry me out at all. \n\nI'm a bit bummed out that these seem to be being discontinued with the price dropping twice in a matter of weeks. I wish I'd bought more tbh! \n\nI actually really enjoy primark skincare. I'm using one of their moisturisers and it's lovely. Comes in a fancy glass jar and is £4! Seen a huge difference in my skin using that, it's quite rich and helps a lot with my dryness. Also adore their mists. I've been using their primer mist for ages, it's no frills but it's got glycerin in it. I use it as a finishing spray mainly to take away the look of powders. Their hydrating mist in the green bottle is nice too, I use that all over my body sometimes. \n\nIn a nutshell,  primark is doing very well with makeup/skincare, introducing ingredients like niacinamide  (sp?) And hyaluronic acid. Super impressed for the price.  Worth a try :)",

I believe that this is likely due to one of the main ingredients being Decyl Glucoside which apparently has a pH of around 11-12, and there doesn’t seem to be any pH adjusters listed that would help to lower the pH levels. I just wanted to raise this as highly alkaline solutions are known to be potentially damage to hair, which naturally has a pH of around 3.6. Not saying you shouldn’t use this product if you enjoy it but maybe just be cautious. I used it to wash my hair today and just adjusted the pH of the amount I measured out, so that might be a way to work around it.\n\nEdit: [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4158629/) is some more info on pH and shampoo and it’s effect on hair",

I'm 24 and I have acne-prone combination skin, with a dehydration problem in the winter (I've been trying to rehydrate my skin for a few months... now that it's summer, I seem pretty oily throughout the day so I don't know if that's been fixed or just masked by the humidity).  I feel like I'm getting more cystic acne - normally just one at a time, and basically everywhere on my face has had one (cheeks, forehead, chin, nose bridge etc.) - along with my regular breakouts.  \n\nAs of right now, in the mornings I'm using CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, then moisturising with the CeraVe cream (in the tub), and using Ombrelle SPF 60 sunscreen (only one I could find that didn't have oxybenzone).  At night, I use Philosophy's microdelivery exfoliating wash, a non-alcohol toner if I wore make up that day, and the Cerave cream again.\n\nI went to the dermatologist yesterday for an unrelated issue I have with pilar cysts.  He asked me if I had any other questions which I wasn't expecting (the whole 1 topic per visit thing) so I mentioned that I have issues with acne.  He asked what I'm using - I told him about CeraVe, then he prescribed Clindoxyl Gel for application at night and Vivier Hexam Cleanser instead, then he sent me out the door.  No explanations of why what he was prescribing is better than what I'm using, or really even how to use the gel.\n\nI'm concerned that he told me to get that specific cleanser since his office sells it, particularly since the ingredients list has fragrance/parfum in it, as well as citric acid.  Does anyone have experience with this cleanser?  I haven't yet purchased it.  This is the whole list:\n\nWater/Eau\n\nDecyl Glucoside\n\nSodium Cocoamphodiacetate\n\nCocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate\n\nPEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate\n\nEthoxydiglycol\n\nDMDM Hydantoin\n\nFragrance/Parfum\n\nHexamidine Diisethionate\n\nCitric Acid\n\nThe other question I had is how would I use the gel he prescribed in combination with my nightly routine.  He didn't specifically say, but I assumed I should be using it all over my face, but I've found online that it says to apply to affected areas - does that mean only where I actually have active acne?  It also seems that I'm supposed to use it after cleansing my face, but how does that work with moisturising?  I take it that applying a moisturiser after this gel would be pointless.  \n\nI do plan on speaking with a pharmacist once I fill the prescription.  Knowing myself, I need to think out the whole issue before I know what questions to ask - otherwise I just walk out and then go.. wait, what?  I hope this doesn't qualify as seeking medical advice.  If it does, I'll remove the post.  I'm just trying to figure all of this out!  Thanks for helping me out!",

If you still have questions, call the office. \n\n\nThe cleanser could be helpful.  Hexamidine diisethionate is a preservative and antiseptic [source[(http://www.minasolve.com/molecules_view.asp?n=17&mi=18).\n\n   Does the office give samples?

However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

Slow healing Generally have some clogged pores/comedones plus a couple hormonal nodules every month. Usually some ongoing PIH+PIE (red-brown acne marks) from that.\n\nAllergic/reactive to strongly fragranced skincare, shea butter, MCI/MI (a relatively uncommon preservative). Mineral oil and lanolin suit my skin a lot better than plant oils.\n\n♦️ **Climate:** Mumbai. Hot and humid summers.\n\n♦️ **Current routine:**\n\n☀️ AM: \n+ Acne Squad Kick-Start Cleanser\n+ DIY vitamin c serum ([details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/eIi64ptr8k)) with glycerin and green tea extract added in to make it hydrating\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream [(review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/QCyo55E2rI) with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder (I skip the powder if wearing sunscreen, otherwise it causes pilling)\n+ Vilvah Melt-in-Milk SPF30 ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/hIPvg9vFiC)) if facing windows indoors or stepping out briefly, Vilvah SPF50 if spending time outdoors. Skip if entirely indoors.\n\n🌙 PM: \n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n+ Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid Face Serum (or a skip day if I feel my skin needs it)\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder mixed in (also over the lips)\n+ 100% lanolin as an occlusive balm - dabbed on the lips, healing acne spots, and (if sleeping in AC or feeling like my skin is sensitised) a thin overall layer by rubbing between the palms and gently pressing all over the face.\n\nNote that I built up to this routine of actives by introducing them one at a time, over the course of several weeks.\n\n♦️ **Age:** Early 30s\n\n♦️ **Usage timeline:** just under a month, every morning.\n\nThe brand directs you to use it daily, AM/PM, which is a bit confusing - does that mean twice a day? 🤔\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coconut Acid, Fragrance, Terpineol, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-6, Citric Acid, Salicylic Acid, PEG-150 Distearate, Thymol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylhydroxytoluene, Sodium hydroxide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Saccharide Isomerate, Linalool.\n\nNotably, contains an unspecified percentage of salicylic acid (looks like 0.5% if we speculate that phenoxyethanol is 1% and the ingredients are in decreasing order) and what they call their \"patented Thymol T Essence™\" which is a botanical extract that has antimicrobial properties.\n\nIs sulphate- and paraben-free, does contain fragrance, linalool, terpineol and thymol as potentially sensitising ingredients.\n\n♦️ **Claims and expectations:**\n\n>A gentle, sulphate-free cleanser created with Thymol T Essence™ & Salicylic Acid, clinically proven to reduce acne causing bacteria & soothe acne in 3 days. Restores moisture leaving skin hydrated with Pentavitin™ molecules.\n\nThe \"soothing acne\" and whole Acne Squad approach with their stages of acne was what got me interested, because yeah, when you're acne-prone it's a cycle that is naturally always ongoing. That seemed realistic to me, I appreciate that. I had been using a 2% salicylic cleanser in the daytime (Zitcare foaming face wash) and was curious to see if a cleanser with less salicylic that had a different antimicrobial action would be more effective and maybe work better for my sensitive skin? \n\nThis proved to not be the case 🙃\n\n♦️ **Price:** MRP ₹325 for 100ml (always available at reduced price of under 300)\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\nThe texture is like most other foaming cleansers that come in a tube, but not super thick. It's a clear gel that makes a soft and fine foam when rubbed between damp hands. Does not lather a lot, but enough to satisfy those of us who need the foamy feeling 😂\n\nIt has a fresh, herby-spicy fragrance that is characteristically from thyme. Quite mild, doesn't linger at all and only lasts for a few seconds when massaged on a wet face and rinsed.\n\nThose who like the smell of tea tree, rosemary or similar green fragrances would like it. Maybe even people who like minty/menthol face washes. I personally really enjoy a herby fragrance, so I enjoyed using it every morning ☺️\n\n♦️ Packaging - a very cute lilac tube. Looks and feels great, but at least initially, the products tends to run out and it dispenses too much just with gravity. It's better to open it with the cap upwards and then flip it down to dispense. A small detail, but mildly annoying at first.\n\n#✨️Effects\n\nFoams quickly and applies very smoothly on a qet face - no dragging at all. The foam only lasts a few seconds after application on the face, and quickly disappears.\n\nThe result is a nicely cleansed face that isn't too stripped of oils. Using a smaller amount gives a gentler cleanser, and using more gives a stronger cleanse. \n\nHere's my problem - after about two weeks of using it daily in the mornings, I started experiencing mild barrier damage and redness. Especially around the nose corners (a tell-tale sign for those with sensitive skin). My skin texture became slightly bumpy all over, and I saw a few pinrpick pustules. Initially I figured I'd just dial back the exfoliation, but that didn't make a difference and eventually I stopped using this cleanser. Within two days my skin was back to normal and drinking up glycolic acid like nobody's business 😂\n\nJust goes to show, even sensitive skin is sensitive TO very particular things. I also use acids in my routine, so that might have had some impact, but I personally find that my skin likes acids and is more likely to react badly to botanical extracts in general. Just confirms that 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nI didn't find it affected my acne in any way, but considering my skin's reaction, that doesn't mean much.\n\n#✨️Final thoughts, pros and cons\n\nI actually really liked using this cleanser, and am somewhat disappointed it didn't work for me. I think it's a nice product, something of a level up from menthol type acne face washes of the past. A nice gateway product for men who are stuck on the \"for men\" train to try normal skincare 😂\n\nI think it would probably work quite well for people of all sebum levels, oily, combo, even dry if used in small amounts. \n\nNormal and resilient skin types would probably find it works well. If you're not using any serums or treatments for acne, I think it's worth a shot to see if this cleanser helps.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin I would use with caution, especially if you already know your skin reacts badly to essential oils, since the extracts are key constituents of those. This doesn't guarantee it won't work for you, just a heads up to keep an eye on your skin (like I did - no real harm done).\n\n\n♦️ **Repurchase status:**\n\nSadly, a WNRP. One of those products that I know a majority of people will probably like, but just doesn't suit me personally. Anyway, I think I can just skip a treatment cleanser in the mornings now (and save it for summer mornings, when I have more oiliness).\n\nI'd love to hear from others who have used this product! Searching the sub didn't bring up any full reviews, is why I chose to post, but I know there's people out there using it. See you in the comments!",

Shampoos have been the biggest struggle because her list of allergies includes coconut-derived surfactants, any botanicals from a flower or citrus, benzyl alcohol (pretty much benz-anything), propolis, fragrance mix 1,  methylisothiazolinone, and Decyl Glucoside.  I finally found something that contains none of her allergens, but looking at the ingredients list, I also wonder if it contains anything that's actually going to clean her hair: distilled water, palm kernel oil, avocado oil, olive oil, safflower oil, potassium hydroxide, and sodium borate. \n\nWhat am I missing?? I guess the oils plus the KOH will saponify, but with no surfactants, won't her hair (3A curls down to the middle of her back) be gross??",

        "body": "I struggled with the fragrant ingredients too.  There are other fragrant ingredients beyond the fragrance mix 1 that cause serious problems:  limonene, bergamot, linalool, citrus peel oils.  Not all botanicals from flowers are troublesome though.  Chamomile, for instance, is fine unless you are allergic.  So the first thing you have to do is make a distinction between problematic botanicals/ oils/ fragrances and non-problematic ones.  What are you concerned about is known contact allergens.  And these are listed by the FDA, which follows the EU guidelines.  \n\nHere are newest ingredients in the list plus the ones that were already there:  https://www.cosmeticscare.eu/en/new-allergens/\n\nHere is a coherent explanation of why they are problematic:  https://tisserandinstitute.org/phototoxicity-essential-oils-sun-and-safety/\n\nNow you know that “fragrance” is not in itself problematic.  It *can* be problematic when that fragrance contains any of these ingredients.  \n\nNow, that said, I would recommend going for the most stripped-down products you can find.  I use [free and clear shampoo and conditioner](https://www.vanicream.com/product/free-and-clear-shampoo) and fragfre light hair gel.  I did a ton of research, and these were the three that worked best for me.  Once I started using them, the constant breakouts on my forehead and temple stopped almost overnight.  If you look at the ingredients, you’ll see they are minimal.  \n\nI hope this helps.  I am not suggesting, btw, that all the ingredients on this list *will* cause problems.  But I think it’s a good guide that can help you make better decisions when you are choosing products.  I want to add that developing an allergy to one of these tends to have a cascade effect.  For instance, I was sensitized to lavender, jasmine, and ylang ylang, and also found I couldn’t tolerate linalool, limonene, or other known contact allergens.",

The Dupixent virtually eliminated my “baseline” eczema that was mostly affecting my face. However, I still had difficulty finding skin care products that wouldn’t irritate my skin - so much so, that I did another round of patch testing last year, with an expanded set of allergens I wasn’t tested for the first time, and found out I was allergic to a lot of other stuff (and am still allergic to the overlapping allergens tested on both rounds). Since then, I’ve been going through the painstaking process of testing things again and I actually have been able to find some things I can use! So, like others said, the Dupixent really helped heal my skin barrier, and then avoiding my allergens is helping me find skin products I can use. Good luck - I hope you find stuff you can use!",
