    "body": "Naisipan kong dumaan sa Watsons ngayong araw para bumili ng lotion, dahil paubos na yung ginagamit ko. Nakita ko tong lotion na 'to ng Luxe Organix na naka B1T1 for Php 405, kaya naisipan kong subukan. 2 variant yung binili ko, itong Retinol + Gluta, tsaka yung Niacinamide + Arbutin. \n\nTLDR:\n\nMay microfoaming, malakas ang fragrance, heavier skin feel kumpara sa ibang serum lotions sa Market, mali-mali ang IL, mislabeled dahil imbes na retinol, Retinyl Palmitate ang laman base sa IL. \n\nUnahin muna nating tingnan ang packaging. Sa unang tingin, di nalalayo material sa packaging ng mga serum lotion ng Vaseline. Tho, yung sa Vaseline, rounded yung tabas ng seal ng tube sa both sides, samantalang itong sa LO ay pointed. \n\nSa itsura naman mismo ng laman, off-white na medyo madilaw yung kulay ng lotion. Medyo clumpy din yung itsura pagkalabas nito sa tube, at madali ding mag-break yung emulsion upon skin contact. Malakas yung fragrance nya na dominated ng floral notes. Unang naisip ko nga nung naamoy ko e amoy poon, dahil sa sobrang floral. \n\nMedyo matagal ipahid sa balat, kumpara sa ibang serum lotion na nasubukan ko na. Naka-observe din ako ng microfoaming during application nitong lotion. Ang microfoaming ito yung nagkakaroon ng puti-puting streaks sa balat habang pinapahid ang isang product, kadalasan mga emulsion gaya ng lotion at creams. Ang microfoaming ay dulot ng pagkaka-trap ng air sa product habang ipinapahid sa balat. Kung ikukumpara ko ito sa ibang serum lotion na nagamit ko na (Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Lotion, Smoochkins Nia-Arbutin Nano White Serum Lotion), ito yung pinaka heavy ang skin feel. Hindi ko masyadong na-feel yung pagka serum lotion. And lastly naka-experience din ako ng pamumula at pantal sa braso ko after ko gamitin itong lotion na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list. \n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance, C15-19 Alkane, Stearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Triethanolamine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Glutathione, Polysorbate 20, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Mannitol, Pentylene Glycol, CI19140, Phosphatidylcholine, Retinyl Palmitate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Chloride, Polyglyceryl-10,  Citric Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nHindi na talaga nawala ang mga errors sa IL ng mga local products. Di yata talaga uso ipa-check man lang sa regulatory personnel ang IL na ilalagay sa final layout ng packaging bago ang ipa-mass printing. Para sa product na ito, hindi Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol ang tamang INCI name, kung hindi Cetearyl Alcohol. Next, Polyglyceryl-10, what? Incomplete yung ingredient name. Ang daming Polyglyceryl-10 esters na nag eexist, wag nyo na kami paghulain. (Side Note: Ang Polyglyceryl-10 esters ay kadalasang ginagamit as non-ionic emulsifier sa cosmetics.). \n\nPangalawa kong napansin, CI19140. Ang CI19140 ay isang dye na kilala din bilang Tartrazine Yellow or FD&C Yellow #5. Ito yung nagbigay ng medyo madilaw na kulay sa lotion na ito. Konektado ito sa kasunod kong punto. \n\nIkatlo, bakit Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalista dito sa IL? Kaya nyo ba nilagyan ng Yellow #5 ang lotion na ito para magmukhang may retinol, kasi nakakapagdulot ng paninilaw sa mga product ang retinol kapag ihinalo ito? Ngayon, ano ba ang problema kung retinyl palmitate ang nakalagay, imbes na retinol? Ito kasi yun: maliban sa obvious na mislabelling sa product na ito, mas mababa ang potency ng retinyl palmitate kaysa sa retinol. Sa buong retinoid family, ang mga retinyl esters kagaya ng retinyl palmitate ang may pinakamababang potency, dahil kailangan pa nito ng isang extra conversion step (retinyl palmitate -> retinol). Tandaan, ang mga retinoids, kailangang ma-convert into retinoic acid para ma-activate ang retinoic acid receptors natin sa balat at makuha ang benefits. \n\nRetinyl esters -> Retinol -> Retinaldehyde -> Retinoic Acid\n\nKada conversion step, bumababa ang potency ng isang retinoid, kaya sa kaso ng retinyl palmitate, na isang retinyl ester, eto ang may pinakamababang potency. \n\nMay peptides din pala itong lotion na ito: Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9 at Acetyl Tetrapeptide-11.\n\nAng acetyl tetrapeptide-9 ay isang signaling peptide na nagbibigay ng message sa fibroblasts sa ating dermis na magproduce ng collagen (specifically Collagen Type 1) at proteoglycans, na mahalaga para mapanatili ang structure at mapanatiling tight (hindi sagging) ang balat natin.  Nakakatulong din itong mabawasan ang appearance ng fine lines sa mukha, dahil na rin sa stimulation ng collagen at proteoglycan production. \n\nKung ang dermis ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, ang epidermis naman ang target ng acetyl tetrapeptide-11. Kagaya ng acetyl tetrapeptide-9, signaling peptide din ito na nagbibigay ng mensahe sa epidermis na mag-synthesize o magproduce ng Syndecan-1 at Collagen XVII. Kapag mataas ang dalawang ito sa balat, nag-iimprove ang elasticity ng balat. \n\nKaramihan ng mga nabanggit na benepisyo ng dalawang peptides na ito ay base pa lamang sa mga in-vitro studies na naisagawa na. Wala pang gaanong in-vivo clinical studies na lumabas kaya medyo skeptical pa din ako sa mga peptides na ito. \n\nTumungo naman tayo lastly sa product claims. \n\n* Retinol + Gluta\n\n* Whitening Serum Lotion\n\n* Lightening\n\n* Firming\n\n* Hydrating\n\n* 24 hr Supple Smooth\n\n* 3X Peptide Youth Repair + Hyaluronic Bright + Ceramide Glow\n\nUnang claim pa lang, sablay na. Wala namang retinol tong lotion na 'to. Pinaglololoko ako nitong LO e. \n\nSa claim na lightening at whitening, medyo duda ako. Mukhang glutathione lang ang pwedeng masabi ng brand na ito na skin lightening ingredient. Pero duda ako sa efficacy ng glutathione na makapagpa lighten ng skin topically. Maraming limitations yung mga published studies tungkol sa efficacy ng topically applied gluta, gaya ng mababang bilang ng participants sa studies at sobrang iksi na study period. \n\nSa claim na firming, mukhang inilagay ito gawa nung mga peptides. Sa hydrating claim, meron namang hydrating ingredients (glycerin, hyaluronic acid derivatives, olive oil, Plukenetia Volubilis oil, tsaka Ceramide NP). Same din dun sa mga sumunod na claims, dahil sa presence ng mga nabanggit na ingredients. \n\n\nFinal words:\n\nHindi ako masaya sa nabili kong lotion na 'to. Hindi kasing lightweight at fast absorbing nung iba kong nasubukan na serum lotions. Amoy poon yung fragrance. May microfoaming during application. Nagkapantal ako sa braso. Mali-mali ang IL. Pero yung pinaka disappointing sa lotion na 'to e yung claim na may retinol daw, pero retinyl palmitate lang ang nasa ingredient list. May paglalagay pa ng yellow dye para magmukhang may retinol. Napakalaking red flag para sa akin ang pagmi-mislabel ng product.\n\nAyun lang. Salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. \n\n",

        "body": "*TL;DR for anyone scrolling past*\n\n* LO Retinol + Gluta uses retinyl palmitate and not retinol, which is a low potency variant of retinol that requires extra conversion steps to get the same effects as retinol. Yellow dye appears to have been added to the lotion to give the appearance of fully evolved retinol being an ingredient as retinol usually makes creams look yellow.\n* The peptides used claim to target fine lines and elasticity, but only proven by in-vitro studies (i.e. in controlled lab environments) vs. in-vivo (i.e. on living organisms)\n\nThank you for this in-depth review, skincare\\_chemist19!

    "body": "I've copy/pasted this text multiple times now and decided to just make a separate post about it (and I admit I want to be lazy and just post a link instead of repeatedly copy/pasting a comment). Some of you may recognize a good portion of this, but I've added some points because I'm trying to make this post as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn order to determine whether a product is water-based or silicone-based, you have to look at the ingredients. -Cone/-methicone, and -siloxane words near the top of the list tend to signal a silicone-based product. Water will be at the top of the list for any liquid product because water makes it liquidy. It doesn't mean that a product is water-based. Without water, the product would not be spreadable/blendable. For example:\n\nMAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microperfecting Primer Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Aqua (Water), **Dimethicone**, **Trisiloxane**, PEG-12 **Dimethicone**, **Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone** Crosspolymer, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Squalane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Lauryl PEG/PPG-18/18 Methicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ceteth-10, Laureth-4, Ethylglycerin, Panthenol, Potassium Sorbate, Polysorbate 60, Parfum (Fragrance), Argania Spinosa Extract (Argania Spinosa Kernel Extract), C12-14 Pareth-12, Hydrolyzed Algin, Dodecene, Sorbitan Isostearate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Tromethamine, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Linalool. [CI 19140 (Yellow 5 Lake), CI 75470 (Carmine), CI 77007 (Ultramarines), CI 77288 (Chromium Oxide Greens), CI 77289 (Chromium Hydroxide Green), CI 77491 (Iron Oxides), CI 77492 (Iron Oxides), CI 77499 (Iron Oxides), CI 77742 (Manganese Violet), CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)].\n\nSee the bold words? Definitely silicone-based! Again, the water keeps it a more liquid-y consistency so it's easily spreadable. It doesn't mean that the product is water-based. Particularly with primers, I can always tell because it has that \"silicone\" feeling. Now let's look at a water-based primer:\n\nLaura Mercier Foundation Primer - Oil Free Ingredients (from Sephora's website): Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Isodecyl Isononanoate, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, C22-20 Alcohols, Squalane, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Esters, Phenoxyethanol, Boron Nitride, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Allantoin Tocopherol Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Hamaelis Viginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Retinyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Polyamino Sugar Condesate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Chlorphensin, Benzoic Acid, Polysorbate 60, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Saccharomyces/Xylium Black Tea Ferment, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Potassium Sorbate, Green 5 (CI 61570), Yellow 5 (CI 19140).\n\nSee how there are no -cone/-methicone or -siloxane words near the top of the list? That means that it's water-based. This primer does contain dimethicone, which is a silicone, but it's relatively low on the list, which means that it contains a very small amount of silicone (ingredients are typically listed in order, beginning with what is in there most and ending with what is in there the least). Thus, because this primer contains much more water (and other ingredients) than silicone, it is water-based.\n\nOil-based foundations are exceptionally rare. After much searching, I finally found one: Alexandra de Markoff Countess Isserlyn Cream Makeup (another is NARS Balanced Foundation, which has been discontinued, so I could not find an easily copy/paste-able ingredients list). Let's look at the ingredients:\n\nWater (aqua), **Decyl Oleate**, **Lanolin Oil**, Propylene Glycol, Talc, Isotearic Acid, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Acetate, Triethanolamine, Fragrance (parfum), Emulsifying Wax NF, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, PPG-12-PEG-65 Lanolin Oil, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben. May contain Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI77492, CI 77499, Ultramarines (CI77007)\n\nYes, water is listed as the first ingredient, but that is to keep the product more blendable. The second and third ingredients (in bold) are definitely oils. Phew! You don't know how many ingredients lists I went through to find that! I swear unicorns are easier to find! ANYWAY, they should play well with silicone-based primers. However, this is unlikely to be of concern to you because chances are you're not using an oil-based foundation (if you are using an oil-based foundation, check your closet for a herd of unicorns).\n\nIn general, you want water-based primers with water-based foundations (or tinted moisturizers, BB creams, CC creams, concealer, or any other base products; I'm just going to keep typing \"foundations\" for the sake of brevity), and silicone-based primers with silicone-based foundations. The two different bases (water and silicone) can cause your foundation to pill when layered on top of each other. In particular, using a silicone-based primer with a water-based foundation on top of it often causes the foundation to pill because the primer creates a silicone barrier. When you try to apply a water-based foundation on top of that, the silicone repels the water in the foundation, and the water in the foundation does not absorb properly into your skin, resulting in unevenness.\n\nPlease remember to moisturize well underneath your makeup (and to give your moisturizer time to absorb fully, meaning your skin should no longer have that \"tacky\" feeling that you have right after applying moisturizer). If you use sunscreen (which you should, especially with summer coming up), you need to let that absorb as well. The base of your moisturizer/sunscreen is irrelevant, because if you allow them to absorb completely, they will not affect makeup application at all. If you begin applying primer and foundation before your moisturizer and/or sunscreen has fully absorbed, they can cause your makeup to break up sooner, which is the opposite of what you want.\n\nAlong the same line, your powder is irrelevant to the base of your foundation/primer. There is no such thing as a water-based powder (it then wouldn't be a powder). If your powder isn't working with your foundation/primer and giving you the look that you want, it is not related to the base of your foundation/primer. Also, not everybody needs to use powder on top of their foundation, so if you're not liking the look, you may consider skipping powder altogether.\n\nAdditionally, you only need a small amount of primer for your face (a very thin layer is sufficient... your face should not feel too slippery). Do not apply too much primer. Water-based primers will absorb into your skin better, but silicone-based primers tend to sit on top of it. Using too much will create a slick film that causes your foundation to slide off much sooner. Remember that it is easier to add more (and I recommend that you add more gradually, little by little) than to take primer off of your face. Over time, you'll get used to the amount you need for your face.\n\nWhile pore-filling primers, such as Benefit Porefessional, NYX Pore Filler, and Too Faced Primed and Poreless, are designed specifically to fill in your visible pores, you can also use any primer to do this (though in my experience, they do not do as well at filling in pores as pore-filling primers, and silicone-based primers work best for filling in pores). Just make sure that you tap the primer into your pores rather than rubbing. Tapping gets the product into your pores to fill them in. Rubbing does not do the same (though you can rub afterward to make sure the surface is smoothed out) and will not give you the same pore-filling results.\n\nFinally, please remember that just because you are using two products with the same base, it doesn't necessarily mean that the products will work for you. Not every product works for every person. You may need to experiment to find the right combination for you. I highly recommend asking for samples, as they are a much cheaper (i.e. FREE) method of trying out a product. You can ask for samples of any product that can be sanitized and put in a small sample jar, such as primer and foundation.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful.

    "body": "Happened upon a guide from a dermatology magazine from ye olde days of circa 2004 which outlined in laymen's terms the core principles of cleansing and moisturizing for different skin types and conditions. These basic key points haven't changed in well over several decades, despite all the gimmicks and new breakthroughs. Thought it'd be an interesting read for both skincare newbies just embarking on their journey and enthusiasts alike. \n\n \n\n# Making the Choice\n\nEvery patient needs to cleanse and moisturize skin properly using suitable cleansers and moisturizers containing the appropriate ingredients. In patients with compromised or sensitive skin, proper cleaning and moisturizing is even more critical. Using too harsh a cleanser or an inappropriate moisturizer can, in many cases, exacerbate certain conditions and can cause contact dermatitis and other problems. \n\nThe plethora of cleansers and moisturizers available today makes it difficult to keep current with new ingredients and their actions — or to guide patients in the selection of these products. In addition, few trials have looked at cleansers and moisturizers and their therapeutic value. \n\n“Dermatologists must understand the ingredients in the products their patients use and what they do to or for the skin. However, the market changes quickly and it is very difficult to keep up,” says Zoe Diana Draelos, M.D., P.A., Clinical Associate Professor, in the Department of Dermatology at Wake Forest University. “They need to keep abreast of this as much as they keep abreast of any aspect of their medical practice by reading journals and going to meetings This aspect of the dermatology practice is just as important as any other since cleansers and moisturizers have a dramatic impact on the skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Moisturizer:**\n\nXerosis occurs when the water content in the skin is less than 10% to 20% — depending on the measurement method, and there is a loss of continuity of the stratum corneum. While moisturizers cannot repair skin, they can help restore the skin barrier and protect the skin as it heals. \n\n“Moisturizers need to stop water loss, decrease itching and burning, and make the skin feel smooth and soft,” says Dr. Draelos. “This creates an optimal environment for healing. Because the skin turns over every two weeks, healing can occur rapidly.” \n\nA good moisturizer should also be hypoallergenic, non-sensitizing, and non-comedogenic. The ingredients in moisturizers are often divided into occlusive agents, humectants, and emollients. \n\nOcclusive agents physically prevent or retard water loss. The most effective occlusive moisturizer is petrolatum. Lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones, such as dimethicone, are also very effective occlusive moisturizers. Applying an occlusive moisturizer immediately after bathing may be an effective way to trap additional water in the skin. \n\nHumectants attract and bind water and can improve the hydration of the stratum corneum. Effective humectants include propylene glycol, glycerin, urea, hyaluronic acid, and pyrrolidone carboxylate (NaPCA). However, high levels of humectants can draw water from surrounding cells and can actually dry the skin further. if not trapped by an occlusive agent. \n\nEmollients soften or soothe the skin by filling spaces between skin flakes and creating a smooth skin surface. They are usually light oily substances, such as octyl octanoate, sesame oil, grape seed oil, or cetyl stearate. Some emollients can also function as occlusive moisturizers. When combined with an emulsifier, the oily emollients are thoroughly mixed with the other water-soluble ingredients in the moisturizer. Emollients are probably the most important consumer ingredient in moisturizers since they provide the smooth skin feel associated with well-moisturized skin. \n\nMoisturizers may contain additional additives such as vitamins E, A, C, niacin, panthenol, peptides, polyphenols, aloe vera, and others. Alpha hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid or glycolic acid, may also be added to decrease cohesion of the excess stratum corneum cells, reducing roughness and scaling. The special ingredients are designed to function as cosmeceuticals imparting unique attributes to standard moisturizer formulations.\n\n Their final efficacy depends on how much of the ingredient is in the moisturizer and how the final formulation interacts with the skin. Despite their benefits, many patients resist using the most effective moisturizers since they often have unappealing characteristics. \n\n“Petrolatum is actually the very best moisturizer available, but it stains clothing, smells bad, and is greasy,” says Dr. Draelos. “Every other moisturizer on the market is trying to achieve the benefits of white petrolatum without the bad aesthetic effects.” \n\nAccording to Dr. Draelos, a good moisturizer should start with an occlusive agent, such as petrolatum or mineral oil, which is not as thick or greasy. It should also include occlusive ingredients that reduce greasiness, such as dimethicone, a type of silicone. \n\n“You might add grape seed, sesame, or some other lightweight oil and emollients, such as cetearyl alcohol,” says Dr. Draelos. “These are oils that can fit between the dry skin cells and make the skin feel smooth and soft.” It is also now possible to synthetically produce ceramides, which are some of the newest occlusive agents to enter the marketplace. \n\nDr. Draelos is excited about some of the newer developments in moisturizers. “The next generation of moisturizers are moisturizers used in a shower. Patients put the moisturizer on in the shower, and then rinse off. This novel technology effectively moisturizes the skin with long-lasting effects and is known as a new category of skincare products known as moisturizes.” *(These are available to us now.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What to Look for in a Cleanser:**\n\nExcessive cleaning can damage the skin by washing out the natural humectant agents, change the pH value of the skin, and cause irritant contact dermatitis. \n\n“Cleansing damages the skin because the soap cannot distinguish between unwanted dirt and intercellular lipids,” says Dr. Draelos. “Synthetic detergents known as syndets are not as effective at removing dirt, but they do not remove as many intercellular lipids and are pH adjusted. A good alternative is the newer body washes that remove dirt, but leave behind a thin layer of petrolatum, especially if used with a puff.” \n\nWhen cleansing, all patients should use warm — not hot — water and bathe for not more than 10 minutes. Cleansing agents should be spread sparingly on the wet skin and, after briefly taking effect, completely rinsed off. \n\n“When looking for a cleanser, most patients should avoid cleaners with parabens, fragrances and detergents. Patients should also avoid detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate,” says Leslie S. Baumann, M.D., Director of Cosmetic Dermatology at the University of Miami. “Ingredients to look for depend on the skin type, but acne-prone patients should look for cleansers with salicylic acid, while those with rosacea would look for sulfacetamide.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Acne** \n\nSome people with acne may try to stop outbreaks and oil production by scrubbing their skin and using strong detergent soaps and rough scrub pads. However, scrubbing will not improve acne; in fact, it can make the problem worse. Astringents are not recommended unless the skin is very oily, and then they should be used only on oily spots. \n\nPatients with acne should use a mild cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide wash), once in the morning, once in the evening, and after heavy exercise. Acne suffers generally have oily skin, but the skin barrier can be compromised by treatment, leading to flaking and itching. \n\n“I recommend skin lubricants in the silicone family like cyclomethicone and dimethicone, which soften and hydrate without oils,” explains Mary Lupo, M.D., a dermatologist in private practice in New Orleans and professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans. “Cleansers should be mild if on treatment, but high surfactant cleansers or those with salicylic acid are good for oily and acne-prone skin.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Eczema & Other Dermatoses** \n\nAny skin disease will benefit from a moisturizer that strengthens the stratum corneum barrier, even blistering bullous pemphigoid. Moisturizing with a good moisturizer is also very important for a disease such as psoriasis. \n\n“Since this is a disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, keratolytics can play an important role in its treatment. Propylene glycol and lactic acid can be sole, or integral parts, of treatment regimens by effectively removing adherent scales,” says Andrea Trowers, M.D., a pediatric dermatologist who has completed a fellowship in pediatric dermatology at the University of Miami. \n\n“Plastic wrap, plastic gloves or plastic shower caps can be used to occlude the affected area after application of a keratolytic, resulting in increased efficacy.” Patients with eczema usually have an impaired stratum corneum barrier so they can benefit from a moisturizer that will help replace cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids. The only skin diseases that generally do not benefit from a moisturizer are conditions that are skin manifestations of internal diseases such as skin cancer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Photoaged Skin** \n\nPhotoaged skin is generally treated with retinoids, which can dry the skin, especially during winter. For these patients, applying a moisturizer is helpful. The best moisturizing agent is petroleum jelly, but it is too greasy for most people, though a creamy version is available that is almost as moisturizing as the original. If other moisturizers are used, they should be the cream versions of the moisturizer. \n\n“Patients with photo-aged skin should avoid detergent cleansers with lots of surfactants. And they should look for added emollients like petrolatum to soothe,” explains Dr. Lupo. “Sodium laurel sulfate and many polysorbates can be very drying. Moisturizers with safflower oils and ceramide complexes are good. Humectants like glycerin are good as well.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Ethnic Skin** \n\nPatients with darker skin tones, often referred to as “ethnic skin,” have special concerns. “Ethnic skin is generally no more or less sensitive than lighter skin and all the same precautions apply,” says Heather Woolery-Lloyd, M.D., Director of Ethnic Skin Care for the University of Miami Department of Dermatology. “However, ethnic or darker skin is subject to certain conditions not usually associated with lighter skin, such as hyperpigmentation following irritation.” \n\nIf a cleanser or moisturizer causes an irritation on a fair-skinned person, any redness heals and the skin returns to its normal appearance. However, a darker-skinned individual may be left with dark brown patches on their skin, which is especially bothersome if it occurs on the face. E\n\nExcessive scrubbing and harsh cleansers in patients with conditions such as rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis heighten susceptibility to irritation that can lead to hyperpigmentation. Those patients should use the mildest cleanser and least irritating moisturizers. \n\n“While it is difficult to specifically predict which individuals will be irritated by a particular ingredient, a dermatologist should make sure that patients use products with fewer known irritants,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Soapless cleansers are generally milder than traditional soaps and are especially useful in patients with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Additionally, traditional soaps combine with minerals in hard water and can leave an unwanted residue on skin and hair.” \n\nPatients with pseudofolliculitis barbae may find that cleansers with glycolic acid offer some relief. In addition, shaving gels with salicylic acid can be effective against in-grown hairs. However, these products can be very irritating and should not be used for individuals with sensitive skin. Another issue with darker skin is the ashy appearance of the skin when it becomes dry. While not necessarily a medical issue, it is still of concern to darker-skinned individuals. \n\n“Patients with dry, ashy skin will find products with lactic acid or urea to be effective,” says Dr. Woolery-Lloyd. “Because they not only moisturize and hydrate the skin, but they also exfoliate the superficial dry scale.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elderly Skin** \n\nSince elderly patients do not produce a lot of sebum, their skin is dry and prone to itchiness. As a result, the elderly need to be especially careful about skincare. They should wash less frequently and should avoid cleansers as much as possible, relying almost exclusively on warm, not hot, water to rinse away surface dirt. Mild soap, such as glycerin soap, should only be used for local cleaning of, especially soiled areas. The elderly should moisturize frequently, especially after bathing when the skin is still moist. Bath oil can also be used, but patients must be careful about slipping. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Young Skin** \n\nMoisturizing is very important in pre-pubescent children since they do not produce a lot of sebum, and they generally get dirtier and require frequent bathing, which dries the skin. “As far as moisturizers, individuals with healthy skin can use most of the products. Just pick a product that leaves skin smooth, not tight or greasy,” says Dr. Lupo. “A combination moisturizer and sunscreen is an excellent choice because you can hydrate the skin and have the added benefit of preventing aging skin and skin cancers.” \n\n“Young children with ethnic skin who have dry skin — especially those living in colder climates — can relieve the dryness and alleviate the ashy appearance by using products like petroleum jelly or even vegetable shortening that has been refrigerated for a cooling effect,” says Dr. Trowers. \n\nOlder children often resist this approach because of the greasy feel, but products such as Cetaphil emollient cream can be almost as effective, with better cosmetic tolerance. According to Dr. Trowers, children of all skin types who suffer from atopic dermatitis often have more bacteria on the surface of the skin. More severe cases can be cleansed below the neck with chlorhexidine, or in milder cases with a product such as Cetaphil anti-bacterial soap, then bathed in a solution of Alpha Keri bath oil. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Understanding the Ingredients:**\n\nConsidering the difference that proper cleansing and moisturizing can make to dermatology patients, it is essential that every dermatologist understand the ingredients that go into moisturizers and cleansers — and the impact that those ingredients have on a patient’s skin. \n\n“Good practice in cleansing and moisturizing can make a significant difference for patients with certain skin conditions and as a therapeutic response to the side effects of medications used for treatment,” says Dr. Baumann. “It is very important for dermatologists and their patients to become familiar with the individual ingredients in moisturizers and cleansers and to know what they really do. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to respond appropriately because your patient has come in with an unfamiliar product, and you are unable to offer sound medical advice.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   \n*Source: The Dermatologist Volume 12,  Issue 6,  June 2004*",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster.

No niacinamide or allantoin in this one.\n\n**Notable Ingredient Overview**\n\n**Ceramides**: Naturally occurring, long chains of skin lipids (fats) that are major structural components of the skin’s outer layers. Skin as a barrier system inhibits water movement via its extracellular matrix, which has a unique composition of 50% ceramides, 25% cholesterol, and 15% free fatty acids. Together, these lipids form what researchers refer to as \"crystalline lamellar structures\". Ceramides are necessary for the skin’s water-retention capacity as well as for barrier repair and cell regulation. Adding ceramides to skin-care products can help to restore the skin’s barrier system.\n\n**Hyaluronic acid**: Component of skin tissue that is used in skin-care products as a good skin-identical ingredient. Hyaluronic acid can boost skin's moisture content, reduce inflammation, have cell-communicating abilities, and help prevent moisture loss.\n\n**Niacinamide**: Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a potent cell-communicating ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging skin. Assuming skin is being protected from sun exposure, niacinamide can improve skin's elasticity, dramatically enhance its barrier function, help erase discolorations, and revive skin's healthy tone and texture.\n\n**Ammonium Lactate:** Ammonium lactate is a mix of lactic acid and ammonium hydroxide. It is used as a skin moisturizer lotion to treat dry, scaly, itchy skin. Those who are using it should avoid exposure to sunlight or artificial UV rays, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. Ammonium lactate makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Skin is more likely to sunburn. Use sunblock and wear clothes when exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Salicylic acid**: Referred to as beta hydroxy acid (BHA), it is a multifunctional ingredient that addresses many of the systemic causes of blemishes. For decades dermatologists have been prescribing salicylic acid as an exceedingly effective keratolytic (exfoliant), but it also is an anti-irritant This is because salicylic acid is a derivative of aspirin (both are salicylates—aspirin’s technical name is acetylsalicylic acid), and so it also functions as an anti-inflammatory.\n\n**Shea butter**: A plant lipid extracted from the karite tree that is used as an emollient in cosmetics. Shea butter is a rich source of antioxidants.\n\n**Ingredient Lists**\n\n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n>\n> **CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Active Ingredients: Homosalate (12%), Octinoxate (7.5%), Octocrylene (2%), Zinc Oxide (3.5%). \n> Inactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate and Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Hyaluronic Acid, Phytosphingosine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n> \n> **CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Lotion**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Mineral Oil, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Trolamine, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Dimethicone 360, Methylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Renewing SA Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ammonium Lactate, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Cetyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 in Corn Oil), Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Methylparaben, Edetate Disodium, Propylparaben, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum \n> \n> **CeraVe Skin Renewing Night Cream**\n> \n> Purified Water, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Glyceryl stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Saccharide Isomerate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 1, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic  Acid, Caprooyl Tetrapeptide-3, Tripeptide-1, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carbomer, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopherol, Allantoin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Phytosphingosine, Dextran, Xanthan Gum\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n>\n>Purified Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetostearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, Niacinamide, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lauric Acid, Zinc Citrate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Arginine PCA, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, EDTA, Sodium PCA, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer\n>\n>**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Cream**\n>\n>Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Petrolatum, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Behentrimonium Methosulphate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nHopefully this information will be useful to people interested in trying Cerave.",

I personally would go for the Be Plain when it's available because it has a simplified formula without the unnecessary plant extracts and flower oils. I think the Be Plain one would be better for oily skin than the Round Lab one. Both of the Hyggee sunscreens look promising, but I'm gravitating towards the Vegan Sun Cream because it is a chemical sunscreen and I have a tan complexion, I don't want to risk a white cast. However, the Real Sun Cream does have an interesting ingredient list and whipped texture (as I can see on Yesstyle)  and I will be looking out for reviews to see whether it leaves a white cast or not and make my decision accordingly. What I love about the Hyggee sunscreens is that they are fragrance/essential oil free, but they still contain alcohol. I prefer alcohol because it allows the sunscreen to set better and be less tacky. If you have oily skin, I would think that one of the Hyggee sunscreens would work better for you because I have a Kolmar sunscreen (Isntree Watery Sun Gel) that is similar to the new Round Lab and Be Plain sunscreens and I definitely wouldn't recommend it for oily skin as it is way too shiny.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream has beet root extract, which made me think of the Krave Beet Shield. Get this, the Beet Shield was also made in Cosmax, same as this new Hyggee one. So I did some digging and found out that the Beet Shield has the SAME exact 5 filters as this new Hyggee sunscreens in the same order. The rest of ingredients are not too similar though, so I do not think they are the same exact sunscreen, as opposed to how I feel about the Be Plain and Round Lab sunscreens, which I do think are almost identical. I do think this Vegan Sun Cream is inspired by the Beet Shield, with maybe an improved formula, since the Beet Shield did not pass SPF tests. So if you are looking for a replacement of the Krave Beauty Beet Shield but with verified SPF protection, get the new Hyggee Vegan Sun Cream!",

    "body": "Because l‘ve been seeing a lot of posts of people with desperately „dry“ hair use a shit ton of oils in order to „moisturize“ their hair and be confused why their hair is still dry:\n\nIf the outside environment is drier than your hair (has lower moisture levels) it is going to pull moisture out of your hair. \nIf the outside environment has more moisture than your hair (humid climate) your hair is going to soak up that moisture (and become puffy for a lot of people) to create an equilibrium. \nYou can combat this mechanism by sealing your hair with oils (which are hydrophobic). \n\nThat means, the only effect oils primarily have is sealing your outer hair shaft (cuticula). If your outer hair shaft is not smooth, oils are going to smooth it out and by this smoothed area it creates a better reflection of light = shinier hair. Oils can also depending on their molecular size penetrate the hair shaft and fill in little holes, making it appear healthier. Oils also prohibit the „travel of moisture“ if there is a an imbalance of moisture (if your hair is frizzy and you live in a humid climate - oils are your best friend)\n\nThat also means, if your hair is dry oils are not going to give a lot of moisture. They are only going to seal your hair and make it softer (because of the smoother surface). You‘ll need cationic surfactants that bind onto  your negatively charged hair (Oils aren‘t charged at all), which are in all conditioners, masks and leave-ins (something like cetearyl alcohol).\n\n\nWhat you can do to combat dry hair: \n\n- when you are applying your conditioner make sure your scrunch it a bit in and distribute it well (not a lot though as your hair is the most sensitive when wet) \n\n- apply deep conditioning masks (avoid heavy protein based masks, they will make your hair brittle if you are in need of moisture), leave it in for 10-15min and then follow up with a conditioner. Use masks every 4-6 washes to prevent hygral fatigue and unnecessary swelling of the hair. \n\n- when you have rinsed out the conditioner, apply a leave-in (l highly recommend as l am leave-in), again, on sopping wet hair and softly scrunch it in. Then scrunch out the excess water with a microfiber towel. It is very important to use a leave-in when struggling with dry hair and you plan on using a blow drier or heated styling tools.\n\n- when your hair is nearly dry or dry apply an oil (l use a silicone based oil with the silicone being an easily evaporating one) and at this point do not use any heat because it would fry your hair",

You've clearly put a lot of work into this post, thank you!\n\nAs mentioned, some oils are able to penetrate the hair cuticle due to molecule size and others aren't. If you're going to apply oil to wet/damp hair it works better in most cases to apply an oil that does NOT penetrate the hair cuticle, aka a 'sealing' oil.\n\nSome oils can help retain moisture, not create moisture, depending on the reason your hair is dry. If your hair is losing moisture due to protein loss, coconut and argan oil prior to shampooing and conditioning can help combat protein loss which will in turn make your conditioning products work better.",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

My skin is looking beautiful in spots. So happy to find something that works. I use a salicylic wash in the shower too, just FYI.",

    "body": "My search for sunscreens continued and, after 1 year, I finally found what works for me just in time for summer! Also, I know that the KBeauty companies have been releasing new American versions in compliance with the FDA. So, I just want to mention that the sunscreens I reviewed below are all the Korean versions, not the American ones (which I have never tried). One way to identify which version it is: the American ones will say \"Broad Spectrum\" on it, while the Korean version will say \"SPF 50, PA++++\" on it. \n\n**Skin Type:** Combination, but easily oily/sensitive with certain ingredients\n\n**Skin Tone:** I would say sand, maybe warm ivory skin tone\n\n**Environment:** Hot, humid\n\n**Anessa Perfect UV Mild Milk**\nThis one has very runny/milky consistency. It's easy to blend to the skin and dries down fast and becomes matte. I chose to try this over the original because the original has alcohol and fragrance in it. This one is very mild, and marked as safe for sensitive skin and babies. It's what I use on my kids for daily use. This was the first sunscreen I tried that didn't break me out. It did give me some shine throughout the day. But overall, it's comfortable enough to wear for daily use.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics**\nI know this sunscreen gets a lot of hype, but it is honestly one of my HG. This was my first emptied sunscreen. I didn't think I could ever find a sunscreen I would love until I tried this one. It's creamy, but not thick, and it feels so nice on application. It's very moisturizing and I can skip my moisturizer in the morning. It does give a dewy look, which I am not a fan of, but once it dries down, it had a semi matte feel which I really like. I can wear it throughout the day without looking like a greaseball, and it didn't break me out at all. I tried the Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen before, and they honestly feel very similar but I reacted to Round Lab. They're both great sunscreens and if you react to one, the other one might be worth a try. \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua Fresh**\nI didn't think Beauty of Joseon sunscreen can get any better, until I tried this! It is more runny consistency than the original. It feels so nice and a bit cooling on application. It is not as dewy and has a semi matte look and feel, which I absolutely love! Even though it is semi matte, it still feels hydrating and not drying. It doesn't make me oily or shiny throughout the day, and I love that this one is alcohol free. I can see myself going back to the original during the winter time though because it is more moisturizing. But for oily/combination skin, I can see how this can work as a year round suncreen. For me, it's definitely perfect for summer!\n\n**Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Sunscreen**\nI've reviewed this before, but I wanted to include it again since I know that most people often can't decide between this and the original Beauty of Joseon. I tried this before I tried Beauty of Joseon. Their consistency and feel are very similar and almost identical. Round Lab does give a slightly less dewy look on application, which I like, but I think they dry down fairly similar, which is a lightweight kinda matte feel while keeping the dewy look. Neither are sticky or tacky. Neither one gave extra shine or oiliness throughout the day. As much as I love it, I did have a reaction with Round Lab Birch. I'm not sure if it's the Birch or the essential oils in it, but I had red bumps (not acne) after wearing it - even though I had no reaction spot testing it on my arm.  So, just be aware if anyone is sensitive to essential oils. The original Beauty of Joseon is oil free. Like I said, they're both great sunscreens and if you react to one, the other one might be worth a try. \n\n**Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Sunscreen**\nThis sunscreen is a matte girl's dream! To be honest, look wise, this was my favorite of them all. It is denatured alcohol free, oil free, and fragrance free. Sadly, it has cetearyl alcohol in it, which my skin just doesn't like. I broke out in whiteheads and had irritated skin after wearing it for an entire afternoon. I really wanted to love this one. It applies so well and it feels so nice on application and afterwards, no whitecast. It didn't make my skin oily or shiny throughout the day. I really wish it my skin didn't react to it. I will say that this is not as moisturizing or hydrating as the Round Lab Birch Juice or either one of the Beauty of Joseon sunscreens, so I feel like I can't skip moisturizer with this. If you have oily/combination skin, and it is not sensitive to it, I would recommend this. If it is sensitive to this, or you're just looking for a more hydrating one yet still gives that nice semi-matte look, I would say go for the Beauty of Joseon Aqua Fresh. \n\n**They're all great sunscreens. But, I know everyone's skin is different and it really matters on which works best for your skin. Still, I love having these options out there. Honestly, Korean suncreen has changed my view on sunscreens. I used to hate wearing them, but now I love it. Hope this review helps!**\n",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\". Pharma product with incomplete ingredients - currently using, will review)\n\n+ Pulp Off-Duty Cleanser - Aloe Vera, Azelaic Acid, and Alpha Arbutin\n\n+ Aqualogica Clear+ Smoothie Face wash\n\n+ Aqualogica Radiance+ Smoothie Face wash (contains menthol)\n\n+ Plum Green Tea Pore-Cleansing Face Wash (contains cellulose beads and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Put Simply Get Your Greens pH Balanced Gel Cleanser \n\n+ Joy Coconut & Coffee Skin Refreshing & Energising Anti Pollution Gel Scrub (contains walnut shell, coffee seed powder, and perfume - wouldn't suggest for sensitive skin)\n\n+ Joy Spearmint & Eucalyptus Mood Uplifting & Skin Softening Stress Relief Scrub (Seems to be a sugar scrub, contains spearmint & eucalyptus essentil oils)\n\n+ VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash (contains mulberry, rose, orange and lemon peel extract and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\n#🐳 Moisturizers\n\n**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea. Also gelatin - not vegan) [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/prsssq/review_of_rahul_phates_hydrasmooth_hydrating_gel/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n+ WOW Aloe Vera Multipurpose Beauty Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Aloe Revital Soothing Gel\n\n+ Innisfree Orchid Enriched Cream (contains squalane, adenosine, betaine, and a polypeptide.

It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\". The tinted version is not fungal-safe.\n\n+ Ekran Soft Spf 50+ PA+++ Silicone Sunscreen Gel\n\n+ CeraVe AM SPF 30 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Heliocare Advanced Gel SPF 50 (broad spectrum)\n\n+ Kiko Cosmetics Daily Protection BB Cream SPF 30\n\n+ Banana Boat Baby Tear Free Sunscreen Lotion Spf 50+ Pa++++ (water-based)\n\n+ Banana Boat Simply Protect Kids SPF 50+ PA++++ (water-based mineral sunscreen)\n\n+ Sandiva One & Done Tinted Sunblock SPF35 PA++++ (purely mineral - contains 24%Zinc oxide, and iron oxides. Also contains sandalwood powder.  Silicone-based, waterless, comes in 4 shades)\n\n+ La Shield Sunscreen Gel SPF 40 Pa+++ (silicone-based, waterless)\n\n+ Z BLOCK Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++ (purely mineral, silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Derma Essentia Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 Gel with Zinc Oxide (silicone-based, 25% Zinc oxide)\n\n+ Sunstop Gold SPF 55 PA+++ Sunscreen Gel (Silicone-based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge GOLD Ultra Matte Sunscreen SPF 50  PA+++ Gel (silicone based)\n\n+ Aurel Derma UVedge Soft Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ Gel (silicone based, only zinc oxide)\n\n+ Vilvah Melt-In-Milk Sunscreen SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone-free!

    "body": "Hello! After struggling for so long to find moisturizers for my extremely clog-prone skin that cannot handle fatty alcohols, I've created a list of moisturizers that are least likely to break out acne-prone skin out based on the lack of common pore-clogging ingredients and ingredients many want to stay away from just in case.\n\nProducts listed have NONE of the following ingredients:\n- cetearyl alcohol\n- cetyl alcohol\n- stearyl alcohol\n- myristyl alcohol\n- oleyl alcohol\n- cereareth-20\n- shea butter\n- mineral oil\n- petroleum\n- plant oils with comedogenic rating >1\n\nProducts are divided between fungal acne safe and unsafe. All products show whether or not they have silicones, too. \n\nNone of these products have ingredients with a comedogenic rating over 1, except some do contain tocopherol as the last or near last ingredient. The amount is so minimal that it's not likely to cause clogging. Still, *please note that comedogenic ratings are not the basis for how your skin will react!!!* Some of these products may break you out, just like some products with ingredients with higher comedogenic ratings may not break you out. Check all product ingredients before purchasing to check for your sensitivities!\n\nSo far, the list includes 57 moisturizers. If you know of any more or see a mistake I've made, please comment! I will update this list accordingly.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Link to spreadsheet is here!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dQy_YKHMEd8Nfhsr32wUMql6o4TuO9CnRNWyli8kLIA/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.\n\nThere are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.\n\nSome companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about preservatives?**\n\nThere's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of \"chemicals\", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.\n\nParabens are actually quite \"natural\" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.\n\n**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAntioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.\n\nFor your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**\n\n[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using \"natural\" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.\n\n*P.S. I don't know if I'm going to make any more of these lists bc there isn't that much interest in these sorts of things anyway, generally.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR THE THANK YOUS!!",

So cheap and so good. \n\nI'm surprised to see so many sunscreens with only PA+++ in the top 10 with 4+ ratings though. Also surprised to see that the top 10 is dominated by mineral sunscreens. Maybe I should try one but I usually avoid mineral sunscreens because they tend to dry my skin out horribly and the problem only gets worse the more I put on. I always look for a sunscreen that has at least 2 out of Tinosorb S, Tinosorb S Aqua, Tinosorb M, or Uvinul A Plus for best UVA protection.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Edit: title should be fatty alcohols not fatty acids but autocorrect thinks for me and sees me type acids a lot so naturally I must’ve meant acids. SIGH. \n\n**WARNING: LONG BUT I HAVE TRIED TO MAKE IT WORTH.**\n\nHey all!\n\nSoooo, years ago, I was a big advocate for the [idea that some people cannot use fatty alcohols](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1y3ql7/simple_tip_for_those_of_us_who_cant_use_fatty/). This was due to my experiences with CeraVe Cream, CeraVe Lotion, Cetaphil Cream, and Cetaphil Lotion, primarily. More, I was using Ziana (.025% tretinoin + clindamycin), which I have a strong suspicion in retrospect was the cause of a form of folliculitis for me (perhaps chemical folliculitis -- there are several types of folliculitis but in this case, acne that is not \"acne,\" but rather born of continuous irritation of the hair follicles). Of course, like *everyone* going through acne, I blamed every skin product I was using except the prescription active that was *designed* to make my acne better. After all, a doctor gave it to me, and a doctor wouldn't give me something that would make me \"sicker.\" \n\nUnfortunately, it turns out that by the time I started to figure this out, it was all way too late. To this day, I have light pitted scarring in places from an 8 month moderate-to-severe zit explosion on my face that never ceased. It has taught me a lot and pressed me to learn a lot about how skin *actually* functions. I was told the entire time I was breaking out that it was just \"purging,\" only to realize what a misnomer \"purging\" kind of is -- implying the skin is holding onto infections waiting to churn out of it's layers rather than comedones -- open or closed -- that are visible, as well as microcomedones that are the beginning of an acne spot but invisible to the naked eye. At the time, purging to me implied that there were acne spots in the deeper layers of my skin waiting to come out. \n\nSo in the process of me flailing, I felt like this class of ingredients that are otherwise harmless were my bane: fatty alcohols. These are stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and cetyl alcohol. After all, they turned up in *everything* that was breaking me out, including the cleansers, so surely it had to be them, right? \n\nFor example, at one point, I was using Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser + CeraVe Cream. What do these products have in common?\n\n**Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser**\n&amp;gt; Water, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, **Stearyl Alcohol**, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Butylparaben.\n\n**CeraVe Cream**\n&amp;gt;Purified Water, Glycerin, Ceteareth-20 And **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Petrolatum, Dimethicone, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauryl Lactylate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Phytosphingosine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.\n\n---\n\nSo being the ingredient hound I am, I connected the dots to \"must be fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives.\" After all, everything else I used had had these ingredients too.\n\n**CeraVe Lotion**\n&amp;gt; Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceteareth-20 and** Cetearyl Alcohol**, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum\n\n**Cetaphil Cream**\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dimethicone, Glyceryl Stearate, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, PEG-30 Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n**Cetaphil Lotion** *note - I believe this used to have macadamia nut oil in it when I used it and has since been reformulated. \n\n&amp;gt; Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ceteareth-20, **Cetearyl Alcohol**, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Dimethicone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate,Caprylyl Glycol, Benzyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer\n\nHappy, I thought, \"This must be it! I solved it!\" So I cut out fatty alcohol products (which, as I am sure many of you know, is a *massive* pain in the ass) and [tried to facilitate others in doing the same](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/). In fact, I feel like I was the primary champion of \"it might be fatty alcohols!\" back when this sub was only 25k people, and being as we were all learning from eachother and trusted eachother, many people trusted me in that assumption. After all, I had the proof (supposedly) to back it up.\n\nSo I used the lightest products, such as EltaMD PM (which is a wonderful product, don't get me wrong!). Unfortunately, my skin was parched *all of the time.* It was just sick. It kept breaking out for years after, bottle after bottle of EltaMD PM. Life happened, I was removed from the mod group for inactivity, and I just kept on with it - disappearing from this sub for a long-ass time.\n\nAnd then I started thinking... *what did I use before my skin started down this road?*\n\nBefore I knew jack-all about skin, I used Olay pretty religiously. Olay Regenerist, in the pot, with the fragrance. Yep. This stuff:\n\n&amp;gt;Water, Glycerin, Isohexadecane, Niacinamide, Isopropyl Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Nylon-12, Dimethicone, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Sodium Peg-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Fruit Extract, ** Stearyl Alcohol**, Polyethylene, **Cetyl Alcohol**, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Benzyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Dimethiconol, Polyacrylamide, Fragrance, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Cetearyl Glucoside, **Cetearyl Alcohol,** C13-14 Isoparaffin, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, C12-13 Pareth-3, Laureth-7, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica.\n\n*\"[Wait a fucking minute](https://media.giphy.com/media/iAYupOdWXQy5a4nVGk/giphy.gif),\"* she thought. \"That shit has cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol and coconut derivatives all the shit I am avoiding. How the fuck did my face not explode then?\"\n\nSo I did something insane: I tried a cream with fatty alcohols and coconut derivatives that was being recommended on this sub at the time (lol). Some of you may recognize this:\n\n**Cheryl Lee MD Ceramide+**\n&amp;gt;Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (Coconut), Petrolatum, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Polyglyceryl -10 Pentastearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Isostearyl Isostearate, Cetyl Alcohol, 1,3 Propanediol (from Corn), C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Niacinamide, Glycyrrhetinic Acid (Licorice Root), 1,2 -Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Gluconolactone.\n\nAnd you want to know something?\n\n90% of my acne healed in a week. 90% of the acne that had been causing me scars and *ruining my fucking life for years* healed in a fucking **week**. I looked back at all the ingredients for all the products that I had avoided and all the ones I had just been able to use fine as a teenager and by fucking god, what did I miss? **Ceteareth-fucking-20** (sans the cleansers -- I still don't know why my skin hated Cetaphil Gentle, but it turns out that it has broken out with every creamy, non-sudsy cleanser ever, so I've resigned myself to using gentle SLES cleansers for life).\n\nI felt like such a massive asshole. \n\nSo that brings me to now, when I decided on a train on a vacation in NYC to start a skin blog. I had spent those years researching my ass off about skin not to even see what a massive fuckup I had made. I had been able to help my BF bring his eczema 80% into control with bleach bath washes and solve my mom's chronically dry skin and my friend's weird case of eczema on his ring finger, but not my own skin. \n\nI came back to this sub after ~5 fucking years (4 of them AFK) and I still see a lot of people avoiding *all fatty alcohols*. I'm making this post to tell you that it might not be all fatty alcohols. It may be cet-20, like me, or it may be those fatty alcohols in combination with other ingredients (combinations of some ingredients can change molecular sizes, some manufacturers use different sources or molecular sized products, like larger or smaller hyaluronic acid, for example). There's so much complexity with skincare, skin, and ingredients that it usually isn't *one whole class of ingredients*. In short: **your mileage may vary**. This is why spot testing is important, one product isn't for everyone, and while ingredient labels are important for weeding out culprits, you also need to do a bit of research on how ingredients work with others to change how they interact on the skin. \n\nSince then, I've spot tested many of the products I flat-out ruled out and 1. it turns out everything with cet-20 does explode my face, 2. it turns out macadamia nut oil also explodes my face (in the cet lotion), and 3. turns out I can use 50% of the things I thought I couldn't (like jojoba oil!).\n\nI'm so happy that many of you have found this sub educational, but **please** consider what you've used in the past (skincare for face, makeup, EVERYTHING) and don't neglect those products when cross-identifying culprits. It changed my life and it might change yours.\n\nSome takeaways, with bullet points because I love bullet points:\n\n* Don't rule out entire classes of ingredients. Skin is super individual and it may be one stupid ingredient.\n* Don't take all of your skincare advice from the Internet, and if you do, try to diversify. Reddit, acne.org, MakeupAlley, medical journals -- get in there and become your own advocate.\n* Sometimes, skin is just an asshole and you won't be able to figure out what it hates. Example: My skin has issues with CeraVe healing ointment and foaming wash, despite them lacking cet-20. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n* Sometimes, what is considered \"good\" or \"best\" for skin isn't good or best for your skin. Example for me: creamy cleansers. They're definitely recommended *everywhere* for *every* skin condition, esp rosacea (which I have), but my skin fucking loathes them all. No idea why, and that's okay.\n* Just because an ingredient is \"good\" for skin doesn't mean it is good for your skin. Example: Me and high % niacinamide = zits. Me and low % niacinamide = k.\n* Just because it's a prescription doesn't mean it can't fuck you up, fam. I thought prescription = good, no problems here, won't cause issues. I have literal scars to prove me wrong. Instead of assuming all is well, **TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR IF SHIT IS UP AND IF YOUR DOCTOR IS LIKE HEY SHIT IS FINE BUT YOU STILL THINK SHIT IS FUCKED, GO TO ANOTHER DOCTOR**. I wish I had done this. Instead, my doc kept urging me to use it every single night. Went to a new doc and he was like, \"Oh no, your skin is very sensitive, that is wayyyy too harsh.\" Listen to your gut.\n* Almost alll skin rules are more like guidelines (except the baking soda, lemon juice, harsh harsh scrubs stuff - that's all still true since they can all throw your skin very out of whack). Example: I do better with light physical exfoliation once a week than AHA any day.\n\nThanks, and I'm sorry for being such a massive, incorrect asshole. I'm doing my best to correct my errors now (and hopefully go to esthetics school though BF is pushing me to do dermatology).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There needs to be someone on the medical side who can vouch for us not being complete loons about our skin. \n\nYes I have to agree with the sentiment of your post.... over the last few years my skin has been freaking out over every little thing. Too hot, too cold, aha, bha, B3, HA, phenoxyethanol the list goes on. \n\nFor 7months I used Tretinoin 0.025% and built up slowly (I thought), the purge happened. Traumatic. Then just unhappy skin.... but it is gold standard for my issues right? My face said no. \n\nAfter becoming ill last year, severely for 6+ months, all skincare and Tret use went down the drain. Just SS once a day, used as moisturiser. Rarely even washed my face in the evening I was too exhausted. \n\nWhat this did, apart from giving me Cc's and what have you. Was a chance for my skin to repair my moisture barrier on my face. Since medication has helped with the symptoms of my illness,  I have been able to use 1 product in my routine with phenoxyethanol as the main preservative, without it giving me painful pustles and nodules everywhere I experienced before. \n\nI have realised that the rash of whiteheads where ever I use a product with HA in and determined was the HA also happens with high levels of BG. So now planning to test a large molecular weight HA serum to see if I have the same issue without the BG. PG is fine... Propanidol is great. \n\nB3 🤔 causes flushing in my skin. And I'm not really interested in trying again.... \n\nBHA, again let me try again at some point. But method of application might be the issue here. \n\nSo vitamin c seemed out of the lexicon for my skin. I now have a silicone based C vit lined up to trial. \n\nFragerance/ essential oils can still mess me up doh. \n\nMoral of this story for me? Concentrate on keeping healthy skin barrier. The rest comes after.... so cleanse (favourite step), treat (calming, hydrating, emollient and then the acne/PIH target), protect. This approach has been working for me so far.",

    "body": "I wanted to share some tips and knowledge in skincare since a lot of the same questions are being asked in most posts here. I am not a doctor. this is all based from experience, knowledge, research, advice from dermatologist and another great sub skincareaddiction. Remember skin care is a personal journey (trust me! i have a lot of trial and errors too)\n\nBasic Routine:\n\nAM\n- cleanse\n- moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\nPM\n- cleanse\n- treat\n- moisturizer\n\nFrom this, you can add items to suit your personal skin care needs. For example.\n\nOily Skin\n\nAM\n- Cleanse\n- Anti redness Toner\n- Spot treat with BHA\n- Oil free, gel type moisturizer\n- Non greasy sunscreen\n\nPM\n- double cleanse\n- Calming Toner\n- BHA\n- Niacinimide\n- Moisturizer \n\nFor dry skin, maybe add more (7x if u like lol) toner or a heavier moisturizer, etc.\n\nYou dont need to put a lot, start with the basic routine then add one item at a time so you know what works, what your skin doesn’t like. Everyone’s skin is different. For example, silicones are okay for some, for some it causes irritation and clogged pores. Some are okay with zinc, some aren’t. Always patch test first and YMMV. Always look for the science  behind it thus its important to research and check reviews. The cosmetic/skincare industry will try to sell you a lot of stuff.\n\nSummary of my other thoughts (references down below)\n- Always wear Suncreen, indoors, outdoors, cloudy day. As long as there is light (UV index of more than 1), there is UVA, blue light, UVB etc.\n- alcohol is a no-no (alcohol, alcohol denat, SD alcohol)\n- fatty alcohols are good (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol)\n- perfume causes irritation\n- Natural doesnt always mean no irritation\n- Double cleanse what? 1st cleanser (oil/balm) to remove make up/sunscreen, 2nd cleanser (at correct PH) is the gel/foam/liquidy type. Remove dirt, make up, spf. Squeaky clean is not the goal. Do not over cleanse. Strip in the bedroom not your moisture.\n- A broken moisture/skin barrier causes skin problem for all skin types (even oily ones)\n- Hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing. (Multi molecular weight) Hyaluronic acid, glycerin are popular plumping/hydrating ingredient. Although some moisturizers can be hydrating.\n- They talk about toner as being connected to Ph level or whatever, toning is just a hydrating step, dont complicate it.\n- Dont over exfoliate, add one chemical exfoliant at a time (either BHA, AHA, PHA, etc). Once your skin gets acclimated then use all the acids, LoL kidding. Be nice to your skin and say no to physical exfoliation (microbeads). 😁\n- Why do they like to exfoliate? Its helps with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and has brightening effect (other notable ingredients vitamin c, niacinimide)\n- Retinol and vitamin C are tricky yet important ingredients. Vitamin C is unstable. Skin care brands often are misleading about Retinol components. \n- Vitamin C easily oxidizes, once you open the bottle or been sitting on a shelf of a long time, exposed to sun and other elements. Its just *poof* a waste, even if its marketed as stable with Ferulic acid, etc. that’s why the L-Ascorbic Acid powder is popular (although not easy to use) but is the most effective version out there. There are other vit c products (cheap or expensive) that are said to be effective and hyped by many, YMMV.\n- most Retinol products are a sham. Just use retin-A or tretinoin (for efficacy) if you’re worried about wrinkles.\n- Some noteworthy retinol products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI\n- Collagen supplements gets metabolized in your stomach before it reaches (if any left) your skin. So you can’t drink beautiful skin but always drink water not sugar, dairy.\n- Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients  that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.\n- Peptides at most are moisturizing. The only science backed up peptide is the one found in TO Buffet + Copper Peptides and NIOD CAIS2\n- Apply skin care beginning with lightest to heaviest; liquid type to cream, last is oil.\n\nPopular youtube beauty/skincare vloggers:\nHyram, James Welsh, gothamista, Liah Yoo, etc. They all can teach you something or two but they are not doctors/experts/chemist. Sometimes they agree on certain products, sometimes they dont. But they push products (does gothamista really use all of those (tons and tons) products?) I bet she uses NIOD CAIS2 consistently though, just a guess. Liah really looks young though (genes?). They are fun to watch too.\n\nFor example, Krave Beauty Matcha is a holy grail for James Welsh but ‘its okay’ for Hyram. Gothamista likes ‘the face shop oil cleanser’ but I seriously cant get over the perfume. But they all like (not sure about Liah) Klairs Soft Airy UV essence and Purito centella unscented sunscreen. Liah does not like alcohol but now, Krave Beet the Sun Sunscreen has alcohol.\n\nRead up on science:\n- Thebeautybrains.com\n- The beauty brains podcast hosted by a cosmetic chemist\n- Lab muffin - written and vlogged by a chemist\n- Beautypedia ingredient list\n- Cosmetic Cop - Paula Begoun\n\nRead, cross check, find references\n\nFinally, big and expensive clinics will ask their dermatologist / aestheticians to sell products. Be aware. Find a good, honest, within your budget dermatologist. Get to know them, be friends with them. He/She can provide you a lot of insights and help, even free stuff.\n\n*if i missed something, got something wrong and/or additional thoughts, please please do make a comment and let me know.

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens® B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens® B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

Nasaktuhan na nakita kong naka-live yung sa Dermorepubliq kaya napagpasyahan kong tingnan ang kanilang mga product. May isang product na nakatawag pansin sa akin: ang kanilang 1% Retinol Serum. \n\nNapukaw ng product na ito ang aking pansin dahil sa taas ng retinol na nilalaman nito. Mataas ang 1% retinol para sa isang leave-on product, ang rekomendasyon nga lang nito sa E.U. ay nasa 0.3% lang (https://health.ec.europa.eu/publications/revision-scientific-opinion-sccs157616-vitamin-retinol-retinyl-acetate-retinyl-palmitate_en). \n\nKaya sinilip o naman sa listing ng Dermorepubliq 1% Retinol Serum, una kong hinanap ang ingredient list nito. Pero laking gulat ko nung makita ko ang ingredient list nito:\n\nAqua, Isopropyl Myristate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Niacinamide, Retinyl Palmitate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Snail Secretion Filtrate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Allantoin\n\nWalang Retinol, imbes, Retinyl Palmitate ang nakalagay. Malinaw na mislabeled ang produktong ito. Hindi ko tuloy maintindihan kung papaano nakalusot sa FDA ito noong nag-apply ito ng cosmetic product notification. 🤦‍♂️\n\nKaya para sa lahat: laging maging mapanuri sa inyong binibiling produkto.

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "I have **combination skin with an oily T-zone and dry acne prone cheeks laden with PIH**, an aftermath of 2020 and some wrong skincare choices. Since I am acne prone, I try to avoid perfume/fragrance, alcohol and essential oils in my products. \n\n*Processing img thx4k3izjnf61...*\n\nI have tried a bunch of sunscreens and these are the **best ones** I have settled on after a long 2 years of trial and error and time/money/effort invested. I have tried to include the swatches of all the four sunscreens and the white cast whereever it was possible (suncros) for the camera to capture. Lets begin.\n\nProduct Name: **Suncros Soft Matte Finish Gel, SPF 50, PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave\n\nAvailability in India: Easily Available in India, offline and online.\n\nIngredient list: Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate.\n\nSunscreen type: Physical / Mineral \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zgtf9w6knf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0796b78286edcc7126df7421f34ae34c3ae1c7c8\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using this sunscreen since almost one year. I used to use UV Doux before this for as long as I can remember, but had to stop using it as my skin got really sensitive and I had damaged my skin barrier. \n\nYou definitely cannot use the recommended two fingers of sunscreen with this one as it gets really heavy and suffocating. I tried layering it in small amounts (maybe just one fingertip at a time), let that settle and then apply another fingertip. I could only do two fingertips with this one. It did work for my extremely sensitive skin at that time and miraculously it was even calming and healing for my active acne and the PIH post acne was really minimal. The texture is in between a cream and a gel as can be seen in the picture. I totally understand why people detest it so much, the heavy suffocating feeling is a put off. I am not going to lie, it is heavy, feels like a suffocating layer on your face and is uncomfortable but you get used to the feeling once you see that its actually working for your extremely sensitive skin when nothing else does. You have to properly blend it in, take a minute or two to actually spread it on the skin. I have tried to photograph the white cast this one gives immediately post application. but once it settles in 30 minutes or so, the white cast is almost negligible and gives a primer finish (I am NC 43-45 for reference). I don't use makeup so I don't know how it would perform under makeup. The reapplication is difficult. I blot my face a lil before I apply this and again it takes a while to settle which is irritating if you are out and about. I could never reapply this more than once. It is sweat proof, tested it in peak of summer. This is the only zinc oxide based sunscreen that did not dry out my cheeks. \n\nAll said and done, I can't seem to make it work as my stand alone sunscreen as two fingertip amount is just not going to cut it when you are on all sorts of actives. Hence, since I have healed my skin barrier now and can use chemical sunscreens again, I use it over my cheeks (an area where my PIH is the worst) layered over my chemical sunscreen, after it completely dries. It's the perfect sweet spot for me and helps with PIH.\n\nRepurchase Status: Holy Grail (HG). Already repurchased twice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Bello Photostable Emugel Sunscreen SPF 40 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Easily available offline and online.\n\nIngredient list:\n\nKey Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol, Ethylhexyltriazone Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyltriazine, Diethyl amino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate.\n\nOther ingredients: Purified water, Dimethicone and Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl phosphate, Ceteth-10 phosphate, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Myristyl Myristate, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic Triglyceride, Pentaerythirtyl distearate, Phenyl trimethicone, Vitamin E acetate, Carbomer copolymer, Disodium Edetate, Trolamine, Sodium polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Methyparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr24pvoaknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f726d323339bee404855990ab043e2a3b051acc2\n\nExperience & opinion: I have been using it everyday since approximately 4 months. The texture is creamy and you have to work it in for like 2 minutes into the skin. Immediately post-application, the sunscreen feels greasy to touch and looks oily but it gets absorbed into the skin in about 10 minutes and leaves a dewy finish which never goes away. I really like the dewy healthy glow it gives me. I can actually use 2 finger amount of sunscreen and it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin tone. If it gets into your eyes, it does sting. I can assume that dry skinned people would loooooove this in the winters. If you are combination or oily, I feel you can completely skip the moisturiser step when using this in summers. Would be perfect for inclusion in a minimal routine in the AM. On reapplication, it does leave a little bit of white cast on the sides of the face where we tend to have the peach-fuzz which will go away with a little bit of rubbing. Overall, this is the best budget sunscreen easily available in India which doesn't make us look like we have dressed up for a meme.\n\nRepurchase Status: HG, WRP. Already repurchased thrice. I will be trying out Photostable Gold SPF 55 in the summer, maybe it will replace this one. If not, I will always come back to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **Biore UV Smooth Kids Milk Spf 50 PA++++**\n\nReview Type: Rave ❤\n\nAvailability in India: Availability is a serious issue. Used to get it from Dokodemo pre-pandemic. Haven't been able to source since.\n\nIngredient list: Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Glyceryl Behenate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Distearate, Sodium Acrylate/​Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Paraffin, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Ceresin, Isohexadecane, Arginine, Lauryl Methacrylate/​Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 80, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dextrin Palmitate, Agar, Petrolatum, Succinic Acid, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT.\n\nSunscreen type: Chemical\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjsnx8acknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e3e74e3ba70e6471b63c4d83bd3d41c2e876eab\n\nExperience & opinion: I had been using it everyday in dry summer days. Where I live is not very humid and that's why I think this one works so well for me. The texture is very aptly described as milk since it feels like a thick emulsion and spreads into nothingness into the skin. I can use the recommended amount of sunscreen with this one and it doesn't leave a white cast at all. It gets absorbed into the skin within 2 minutes and leaves behind a comfortable breathable layer of moisture on your skin. It does not dry down matte. It doesn't irritate my eyes. Its just so perfect for my combination skin even on my oily T-zone in peak summer days.  Reapplication is such a breeze. I have reapplied it in a taxi, in my office, before a meeting without any downtime. I just absolutely love everything about this sunscreen except that I think it has been discontinued and I am crying over the loss of my only true HG sunscreen. If anyone from Biore is reading this, please accept my plea and bring this back into production!!!!!\n\nRepurchase Status: HG forever. Although on the look out yet again for something that would match this one's status!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduct Name: **The Blessing Tree Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 PA+++**\n\nReview Type: Rant\n\nAvailability in India: Available on Amazon.\n\nIngredient list: \n\nKey Ingredients: Octyl Methoxy Cinnamate, Oxybenzone, Titanium Dioxide, Octocrylene, Avobenzone, Zinc Oxide.\n\nOther ingredients: Aqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Diisopropyl Adipate, 1, 3, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Acrylates /​ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylare Cross Polymer, Propanediol, Diethylhexyl Sryngylidene Melonate, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Xylitylglucoside (and) Anhydroxylitol (and) Xylitol, Niacinamide, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Perfume.  That was a task to type!!!!!\n\nSunscreen type: Hybrid\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52ec0gwdknf61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8dd848f71d4a3939aa1b3ea6f13df4428170a9b\n\nExperience & opinion: I have had this for around 1 1/2 years now. But I never had the courage to put it on my face due to the infamous \"perfume\" in the inci list as I had a compromised barrier and could tolerate only physical sunscreens. All said and done, this has served well as an excellent body sunscreen which doesn't break the bank and provides me excellent protection. It is non-greasy unlike the other body sunscreens on the market. The white cast disappears within 5-10 minutes and you are good to get dressed and head out of the house. I apply it on all the exposed areas of my body - neck, upper shoulders, arms, hands (I don't feel guilty reapplying it even with the frequent hand washing as its relatively affordable + acts as a moisturiser for me) and feet. \n\nHowever for the sake of this review, I mustered all the courage I had to try it on the face but alas it did not suit me and caused me CC's by evening. It spreads well, leaves a white cast on skin which disappears in about 5-10 minutes, although the white residue along the hairline just doesn't disappear. I had to rub it excessively, almost rubbed it out to get it out of my peach fuzz! The finish on this sunscreen is not ultra matte and nor is it dewy to touch, its almost in between which is comfortable for combination and oily skin types. I was worried that this might get drying on my cheeks as the day progressed due to the zinc oxide content but it did not get dried at all. While I was typing the inci list, I realised it has Niacinamide in it!!! Yet another amazing ingredient to be present in this sunscreen. All in all, I would say if you don't have sensitive/sensitized skin and are okay with the \"O\" sunscreen filters, this is an excellent sunscreen.  \n\nRepurchase Status: Might repurchase for body. Not suitable for my face.\n\nThis review took me almost a month to write and photograph, but I am ultimately happy with the final write-up. I sincerely hope you enjoy reading this! I have tried to include everything based on the rules of this sub, but still if you have any questions, do hit me up.\n\nI will make another post of the sunscreens which didn't work for me and would include the likes of Cipla Rivela tint sunscreen, Hada Labo UV Perfect Gel, Skin Aqua UV Moisture Gel, Photostable Insta,  Aroma Magic Mineral Sunscreen and The Mom's Co. Mineral Based Sunscreen.",

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

    "body": "I wanted to share some tips and knowledge in skincare since a lot of the same questions are being asked in most posts here. I am not a doctor. this is all based from experience, knowledge, research, advice from dermatologist and this great sub skincareaddiction. Remember skin care is a personal journey (trust me! i have a lot of trial and errors too).\n\nBasic Routine:\n\nAM\n- cleanse\n- moisturizer\n- Sunscreen\n\nPM\n- cleanse\n- treat\n- moisturizer\n\nFrom this, you can add items to suit your personal skin care needs. For example.\n\nOily Skin\n\nAM\n- Cleanse\n- Anti redness Toner\n- Spot treat with BHA\n- Oil free, gel type moisturizer\n- Non greasy sunscreen\n\nPM\n- double cleanse\n- Calming Toner\n- BHA\n- Niacinimide\n- Moisturizer \n\nFor dry skin, maybe add more (7x if u like lol) toner or a heavier moisturizer, etc.\n\nYou dont need to put a lot, start with the basic routine then add one item at a time so you know what works, what your skin doesn’t like. Everyone’s skin is different. For example, silicones are okay for some, for some it causes irritation and clogged pores. Some are okay with zinc, some aren’t. Always patch test first. Always look for the science  behind it thus its important to research and check reviews. The cosmetic/skincare industry will try to sell you a lot of stuff.\n\nSummary of my other thoughts, generalizations (references down below)\n- Always wear suncreen, indoors, outdoors, cloudy day. As long as there is light (UV index of more than 1), there is UVA, blue light, UVB etc.\n- alcohol is a no-no (alcohol, alcohol denat, SD alcohol)\n- fatty alcohols are good (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol\n- perfume causes irritation\n- Natural doesnt always mean no irritation\n- Double cleanse what? 1st cleanser (oil/balm) to remove make up/sunscreen, 2nd cleanser is the gel/foam/liquidy type. Remove dirt, make up, spf. Squeaky clean is not the goal. Do not over cleanse. Strip in the bedroom not your moisture.\n- A broken moisture/skin barrier causes skin problem for all skin types (even oily ones)\n- Hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing. Hyaluronic acid is a popular hydrating ingredient. Although some moisturizers can be hydrating.\n- They talk about toner as being connected to Ph level or whatever, toning is just a hydrating step, dont complicate it.\n- Dont over exfoliate, add one chemical exfoliant at a time (either BHA, AHA, PHA, etc). Once your skin gets acclimated then use all the acids, LoL kidding. Be nice to your skin. 😁\n- Why do they like to exfoliate? Its helps with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and has brightening effect (other notable ingredients vitamin c, niacinimide)\n- Glycolic (AHA) has studies showing help with collagen formation\n- Retinoids fam(Retinol)and vitamin C are tricky yet important ingredients. Vitamin C is unstable. Skin care brands often are misleading about Retinol components. \n- Vitamin C easily oxidizes, once you open the bottle or been sitting on a shelf of a long time, exposed to sun and other elements. Its just *poof* a waste, even if its marketed as stable with Ferulic acid, etc. that’s why the L-Ascorbic Acid powder is popular (although not easy to use) but is the most effective version out there. There are other vit c products (cheap or expensive) that are said to be effective and hyped by many, YMMV.\n- in my opinion, virtually all OTC retinoids/Retinol products are without value. Some can be misleading. Just use retin-A or tretinoin to get the most efficacy if you’re worried about wrinkles.\n- some noteworthy retinol/retinoids products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI\n- Collagen supplements gets metabolized in your stomach before it reaches (if any left) your skin. So you can’t drink beautiful skin but always drink water not sugar, (for some it may be dairy).\n- Retiniods/Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients  that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.\n- Peptides at most are moisturizing. The only science backed up peptide is the one found in TO Buffet + Copper Peptides and NIOD CAIS2\n- Apply skin care beginning with lightest to heaviest; liquid type to cream, last is oil.\n\nPopular youtube beauty/skincare vloggers:\nHyram, James Welsh, gothamista, Liah Yoo, etc. They all can teach you something or two but they are not doctors/experts/chemist. Sometimes they agree on certain products, sometimes they dont. But they push products (does gothamista really use all of those (tons and tons) products?) I bet she uses NIOD CAIS2 consistently though, just a guess. Liah really looks young though (genes?). They are fun to watch too.\n\nFor example, Krave Beauty Matcha is a holy grail for James Welsh but ‘its okay’ for Hyram. Gothamista likes ‘the face shop oil cleanser’ but I seriously cant get over the perfume. But they all like (not sure about Liah) Klairs Soft Airy UV essence and Purito centella unscented sunscreen.\n\nBeauty related topics in Youtube generates more than 700 million views monthly (this is pre pandemic)\n\nAgain, this is only my opinion. I still have bias, i’m human with skin care stuff on my shelf. 😅\n\nRead up on science:\n- Thebeautybrains.com\n- The beauty brains podcast hosted by a cosmetic chemist\n- Lab muffin - written and vlogged by a chemist\n- Beautypedia ingredient list\n- Cosmetic Cop - Paula Begoun\n\nRead, cross check, find references\n\nFinally, big and expensive clinics will ask their dermatologist / aestheticians to sell products. Be aware. Find a good, honest, within your budget dermatologist. Get to know them, be friends with them. He/She can provide you a lot of insights and help, even free stuff.\n\n*if i missed something, got something wrong and/or additional thoughts, please please do make a comment and let me know.

Just use retin-A or tretinoin if you worried about wrinkles.\n* Noteworthy retinol products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI\n* Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.\n\nAre they a sham or not then? You're contradicting yourself with these 3 statements.\n\nEdit: formatting and trying not to sound so obnoxious",

        "body": "A couple of weeks ago I finally did a virtual derm appointment to treat years of hormonal acne and oily skin. The doctor outlined a simple routine for me which roughly follows the one you described, and pointed me toward some minimal skincare products, which I purchased right after the appointment. She also wrote me a prescription for spironolactone (25mg) and tretinoin (0.018%). \n\nWell, the prescriptions just came in the mail this morning and now I'm not even sure I need them because my skin is clearing up so rapidly, just from following a straightforward AM/PM routine with 4 products. I can't believe I put this off for years!! I was wandering in the wilderness for so long, feeling overwhelmed about what to use and how to use it! I wish I'd known it was so easy. D:\n\nAM\n\n* cleanse: [Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin](https://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod2360125&pr_source=email&pr_merchant_user_id=943080654&pr_campaign_id=et_st&dtm_em=28baa22f2a4eef86a8e4d1d08e87bff1&CID=41892463&SFBID=639889&SFLID=17333952&ET_LID=product+image&RID=943080654&CCID=et_tn___order_confirmation)\n* treat: benzoyl peroxide spot cream, if needed (I use generic drugstore brand)\n* moisturizer/sunscreen (this works as both, which is just fine because it's on the pricey side): [Dermalogica Oil Free Matte Broad Spectrum SPF 30](https://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod6490062&pr_source=email&pr_merchant_user_id=943080654&pr_campaign_id=et_st&dtm_em=28baa22f2a4eef86a8e4d1d08e87bff1&CID=41892463&SFBID=639889&SFLID=17333952&ET_LID=product+image&RID=943080654&CCID=et_tn___order_confirmation)\n\nPM\n\n* cleanse: same Cetaphil cleanser as AM\n* treat: benzoyl peroxide spot cream (now that I have the tret I will sub that in here instead)\n* moisturizer: [La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Face Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin](https://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=pimprod2002095&pr_source=email&pr_merchant_user_id=943080654&pr_campaign_id=et_st&dtm_em=28baa22f2a4eef86a8e4d1d08e87bff1&CID=41892463&SFBID=639889&SFLID=17333952&ET_LID=product+image&RID=943080654&CCID=et_tn___order_confirmation) this moisturizer is the TRUTH. It comes in a teeny tiny bottle but you only need a teeny tiny amount to cover your whole face.\n\nAlso, very random but I've found that washing my upper half with Head & Shoulders every once in a while helps to keep body acne at bay. It's also cleared up keratosis pilaris (sp?) on my arms. I've been using [Head & Shoulders Tea Tree & Ginger Root](https://www.costco.com/head-%2526-shoulders-tea-tree-%2526-ginger-root-2-in-1-.product.100652042.html), and it smells absolutely heavenly as a bonus. I've only seen it at Costco thus far but they might sell it elsewhere, I haven't looked all that closely.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps for anybody else who might also be feeling lost in the wilderness about where to start with acne treatment and general skincare. I always knew that you don't need a billion products to keep your skin clear and healthy, and that most of it is a marketing sham to get into your pockets, but I felt so paralyzed in trying to decipher which should be my \"prized few\" products among all of the choices out there that I kept putting off building a routine that would serve my skin in the long run. When in doubt, just make a derm appointment. So worth it.",

I only started to care for my skin when I became 30 early this year, before I would just wash my face with hands soap and only sporadically moisturize it afterwards aaand of course I used to wear sunscreen only at the beach. I know some of you must be screaming internally but believe it or not my skin was not that bad, I basically only had some texture, whiteheads and dullness. Now my issues are more serious and I'm still trying to heal, long story short there were many mistakes: my mom's derm prescribed me a cream that was devastating, a 10% AHA thick one, that not only irritated me but also covered my entire chin and cheeks with CCs. While trying to recover from that I also messed up due to not knowing my skin's needs very well and overusing actives. What I've learned is that I'm extremely prone to congestion, pretty much every product with comedogenic ingredients high up in the list broke me out, and being very oily, I absolutely need light textures and minimal moisture.\n\n**Skin type:** oily, acne-prone and somewhat sensitive.\n\n**Concerns:** acne, inflammation, hyperpigmentation, oiliness.\n\n**Climate:** metiderranean (extremely hot and humid summer up to 40+°C, mildly cold winter, lowest 0°C)\n\n**Routine:** AM BoJ Green Plum Cleanser, Melano CC Premium Essence, toner, Skin1004 Hyalu-Cica Sun Serum; PM Kose Speedy Cleansing Oil, Cerave SA Renewing Cleanser, toner, Skin1004 Pro-Bio Cica Ampoule, Skin1004 Centella soothing cream.\n\nNow time for my reviews, some are completely empty, some I threw away before taking pictures and others are half-way through.\n\n***Beauty of Joseon - Radiance Cleansing Balm***\n\nWhat a treat! Such a luxurious experience, I love everything about it, cleans perfectly every stubborn waterproof mascara, no smell, emulsifies nicely and leaves the skin clean with no film, even without a second cleanse. Most importantly it doesn't clog my pores or break me out. The only problem is the price/quantity, I know it's one of the cheapest but I go through this way too quickly compared to a cleansing oil so I will repurchase when I'm feeling fancier and richer. **5/5 HG but will not buy again at the moment.**\n\n***BoJ -*** ***Green Plum Refreshing Cleanser***\n\nI love it! Cleans my skin well without leaving it stripped, has a really fun bouncy jelly texture, sometimes I lathered it on my hands creating a really soft foam, other times I just slap it on my face. Very pleasant herbal smell, no artificial fragrance or essential oils. The only downside is packaging, I prefer pumps for cleansers. I want to try Isntree's green tea cleanser as well, but I could see myself always using this. **5/5 WRP.**\n\n***Rovectin - Skin Essentials Conditioning Cleanser***\n\nIt's fine. It might be too hydrating for me, after I wash my face I feel like I tend to get oily much faster compared to my other cleansers. It has a little bit of a scent, reminds me of when you enter a pool during winter, but it doesn't bother me. I love the packaging, super convenient, and it's very gentle, I can wash my face how many times I want without aggravating redness and inflammation, so I will finish the 2 bottles I have. I think people with dry skin searching for a gel cleanser would love this. **3/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Isntree - Green Tea Fresh Toner***\n\nNow this is difficult, I'm supposed to love this given my skin type but I have a few gripes. I think it did help me manage oil production but I was expecting more from the soothing/calming claims, I saw none of that on my acne. I also didn't find it as hydrating or refreshing as I was expecting, but I still enjoyed my time with it. I absolutely love green tea so the sensorial experience was amazing, I think I might give it another go next summer (maybe with the emulsion as well). **3.5/5 MRP.**\n\n***Isntree - Onion Newpair Essence Toner***\n\nWatery, but a little more viscous than your average one. This one truly helped me when I was super irritated, it was very hydrating and I saw immediate reduction of redness, especially when I used it for DIY sheet masks. However despite the good results, I can't use it regularly because it's a little bit too much for my oily skin and it always dries with an annoying sticky finish, so I would recommend this to people with combo/drier skin. **3/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Naturie - Hatomugi Skin Conditioner***\n\nAh it breaks my heart, it's watery and light, packs a punch of hydration, makes my skin super soft... but it makes me shine like a disco ball after barely 30 minutes. I gave it to my sister who has a normal skin type and isn't as oily. **2/5 WNRP.** (T\\_T)\n\n***Isntree - Chestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid***\n\nTough one, I love the blurring and smoothing effect I get with this but at the same time I struggle to understand if I'm too sensitive for 2% BHA leave on products. The morning after I use it, I often get some worsening of spots and after these months I still don't understand if it's purging, simply bringing out to the surface what was clogged, or if it's irritation, sighs. So unfortunately I can't rate this.\n\n***COSRX - Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence***\n\nI do get the hype truly, the most hydrating and plumping product I've ever tried. I love the way it makes my skin look and I also felt the anti-inflammatory effects. There is only one problem, I don't understand if it breaks me out. It's hard to figure out when you always have active acne, but I suspect the lovely film of glow it creates actually clogs me and creates the tiniest pustules and little bubble-like thingies on my pores. I will probably still finish it because I'm not 100% sure if it's the culprit, the \"break outs\" are super small and go away immediately and I love the benefits it gives me. **Need more trial or am just in denial/5**\n\n***BoJ - Glow Serum: Propolis + Niacinamide***\n\nToo thick and viscous for my liking, also dries with a sticky finish that annoys me. This is the only propolis product that I've tried and I was very underwhelmed, I didn't see the soothing/calming benefits that so many people attribute to this ingredient. Maybe it's my skin or Boj's formula, either way the only things this gave me were hydration and glow, which fair enough it's in the name, so I'd definitely recommend it to those who seek glass skin. As an oily gal this is too much for me and I have other priorities (acne). **2/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Pyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Barrier Cream***\n\nAh cystic acne city. I was looking for a ceramide product light enough for oily skin and I can see why it's recommended, it's light with a lovely texture (closer to a gel than a cream) and absorbs decently but unfortunately it made me realize that my skin absolutely loathes fatty alcohols and fatty acids like Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate etc. **0/5 WNRP.**\n\n***Pyunkang Yul - Calming Moisture Repair Balm***\n\nDitto, same problems as above but little did I know, there is also another ingredient here that breaks me out a ton but I didn't recognize it at that time. I use this cream on my partner's thighs after work out irritation, because it is calming and soothing for those that don't struggle with my issues. **1/5 WNRP.**\n\n***ILLIYOON - Ceramide Ato Soothing Gel***\n\nDrum roll, it's squalane. This moisturizer gave me the worst skin of my life, I actually felt gross just by looking in the mirror. At least the product taught me that it's not only about comedogenic ingredients but texture and finish matter as well. This never absorbed, it always left this wet, so oily on me, film that kept aggravating my acne, I will try to finish it on my body despite my hate for it. **0/5 WNRP.**\n\n***iUNIK - Centella Calming Gel Cream***\n\nIt's basically water but not very hydrating, so I feel like it really doesn't do much and it evaporates before the ingredients actually have an effect. Also sometimes it left a weird sticky film with it, not to mention that other times I felt an itching sensation so maybe I'm reacting to something? Fragrance? **1/5 WNRP.**\n\n***SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Soothing Cream***\n\nFinally light at the end of the tunnel! I love this one, the perfect gel consistency for my skin, not too watery and not too thick, it absorbs very fast without leaving any stickiness. I was a little worried about the fatty acids and alcohols but thankfully they must be at a concentration that I can tolerate. I feel the calming benefits and it doesn't add any shine, so far I think it's truly the first moisturizer that I like and doesn't aggravate my issues. **5/5 WRP.**\n\n***Beauty of Joseon - Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics***\n\nMy gateway into asian beauty. Like many I had no idea sunscreens could feel so nice and light, it was love at first sight. Another super popular product so I feel like I don't need to say much, for my oily skin it became too heavy once summer came, but it's still a great product I would wear most of the times. **5/5** (WNRP just because I found skin1004 and there are way too many releases that tempt me).\n\n***SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50+ PA++++***\n\nEveryone knows it right? It's super light, spreads like a dream and absorbs quite quickly. No white cast but I'm very fair and it has a radiant finish that might not suit everyone's taste. My go-to moisturizer whenever I'm out of the house, it's so conforting that at the end of the day I feel like my skin actually improved a little. I would prefer if it had a velvet or matte finish (curious to try the haruharu wonder I bought), but it's so perfect for everything else that I just powder my t-zone. **5/5 HG already stocked up.**\n\nWow that was long! Thank you for reading and sorry about the typos or mistakes, english is not my first language.",

Because of this, i would let my friend with similar skin concerns as yours to test out new products and see if she'll like any of them. And when she does like something, then I would recommend the products to other people with oily skin type 😂\n\nThis was a great read. I also 100% agree on the Illiyoon ceramide gel and iUnik centella gel cream. I have very similar experience with them as yours. However your review on the naturie Hatomugi skin conditioner was pretty unexpected. It's not that it was an incredible toner for me or anything cz it didn't seem to do anything for me. But then the part where it exacerbated your sebum was something that I've never heard before. So yeah, that was interesting to me. \n\nAs for the Cosrx Snail Essence, it's a HG of mine for dehydrated skin. But once my skin has healed from dehydration, i just use less of the product. Because the product alone is actually way too heavy for oily skin in hot humid climate.",

So many hyped products leave a thick film on my skin that never absorbs and ends up breaking me out. It’s interesting because my bf and I can try on the same product, and his skin (normal/dry) will absorb it within minutes while it just sits on top of my skin. \n\nI love the Isntree Green Tea Cleanser and highly recommend you try it out! I’ve been using it as my cleanser for the last few months and will 100% restock when I run out. It’s so creamy, smells amazing, lathers well, and leaves my skin hydrated but clean. \n\nI also really love the Haruharu Black Rice Wonder Toner. One of the only hyped products that has actually worked for me. It absorbs perfectly into my skin and leaves me with a nice hydrated glow, and I swear it also exfoliates lightly. For my night routine I layer this with the exfoliating serums I use (lactic acid or azelaic acid, depending on the night) and finish with Naturie Hatomugi Gel, another super light and refreshing layer that dries very down quickly.",

Oh, similar skin type and concerns as well\n\nI like that your HG are also same as mine!\n\nI use skin1004 sun serum as well, but i didn't know it functions as a moisturizer. I use it on top of my moisturizer, which might have been too much. Now im using Dr. G green mild up Sun+ so far and it's working great, being that it's a mineral sunscreen. Apart from that the white cast is slightly annoying, but goes away after a few mins. \n\nFor CCs, how do you handle them?",

    "body": "Garmi aaa gayi haiiii\\~ dhoop badh hui hai aur heatwaves pardhaar chuke hai 🥵🥵 obviously we need sunscreens! I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "Edits: Tried to fix some formatting issues. \n\n—\n\nHi everyone! \n\n[In my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/?st=JIATDG0T&sh=d905c745), I talked at length about the skin condition of rosacea -- what it is, the subtypes, what the causes are, the foundations in treatment (cleansing and moisturizing), as well as treatments and beneficial ingredients. This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

I always have very dry lips, despite drinking plenty of water and using a combo of Laniege lip mask and aquaphor lip ointment. I LOVE lipstick and it makes me really sad that my lips are constantly peeling despite my best efforts. (1) Is this a rosacea thing?

I read your earlier post on Top 10-20 Cleansing Oils & Gels also. \n\nI'm looking to introduce a new cleanser to my daily routine and was playing with the idea of an oil cleanser.  So much choice, but this should make it easier.  Ideally, I'm looking for something without propylene glycol. butylene glycol, essential oils or added fragrance.  And no parabens - was shocked to see Phytomer still incorporating these!  The ATrue Black Tea Cleanser in your previous post looked interesting; simple list of ingredients, although ironically green tea is the first ingredient in the list, rather than black tea!  Aromatica Orange Cleansing Sherbet looks interesting, as does Clinique - so simple but effective.  Have you any idea what Kakadu (reference Sidmool) means??\n\nWhich do you use incidentally?  You are probably more geared up than most to recommend?  Thanks again.  Bev",

Even when i was  in the flight my skin did not dry out at all ! \n\n\n     ▫️The days i used hydrating serums my skin looked so plump and glowy the next morning,  I couldn't stop admiring it XD \n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVES ?\n\n\n       ▫️ Rosehip oil , followed by any moisturiser and slugging . This provides overnight results.\n\n \n\n      ▫️Rosehip oil pretty much provides the same effect and a small bottle of 30 ml runs a really long way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹  COMPARISON BETWEEN MARULA OIL AND ROSE HIP OIL\n\n \n\n\n\n___ |Rosehip oil|Morula oil\n|:-|:-|:-|\nfatty acids*****|more Linoleic acid and less Oleic Acid|more Oleic acid and less Linoleic acid\nantixodiants| |higher in antioxidants\ntexture|lighter / sinks into the skin|thicker / feels heavier\ncomedogenic rating|low|high\nbrightening properties ( scars )|yes|no\nantibacterial properties|yes|no\n\n\n\n 🔸*****\n\n\n\n\n *🔸you have oily or acne-prone skin, you likely have low levels of linoleic acid in your skin and therefore can benefit from a facial oil that’s high in linoleic acid*\n\n\n*🔸As a general rule, if you’re acne-prone or oily, you want an oil that’s high in linoleic acid. Whereas if you have dry skin, an oil that’s high in Oleic acid will help you more*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔹 REPURCHASE STATUS \n\n\n        ▫️ WNRP\n\n\n        ▫️ Its a great moisturiser but rosehip oil provides the same effect , doesnt leave a heavy feeling post application. \n\n\n       ▫️for dry scaly patches i swear by the slugging method",

    "body": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a few short reviews of some AB Hair products. I don't see a lot of hair talk on here, so thought I would add some reviews. I would love to see other people's reviews on hair products. :)\n\n[Deep Conditioner, Shampoo Brush, Scalp Essence, and Styling Wax](https://preview.redd.it/jxsbjdmqg7811.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fa1e18447c09eb79feb82246301255d9da84e7b)\n\n**My Hair Background**\n\nHair texture: Wavy, Fine\n\nHair Type: *Dry*\n\nHair Health: *I am starting to get gray hair. I got my first one not too long ago. Split Ends are taking over my hair. I used a temporary color over 6 months ago that has washed out. My hair was virgin before the temporary color, but I don't know if I can still call it virgin since the color wash.*\n\nScalp Concerns: *Extra dry and sensitive, psoriasis.*\n\n**Too Cool For School Egg Remedy Hair Pack**\n\n[Too Cool for School Egg Remedy Hair Pack](https://preview.redd.it/igz4eiczg7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8aa9cee3e449a134de056a38e76ba904e542f03f)\n\nI bought this for the protein. It was $10.99 on Amazon.  It is a deep conditioner treatment meant to be used 1-2 times a week. It is for repairing hair. It not recommended for normal hair, or protein sensitive hair.\n\nScent: *Sweet like milk and honey*\n\nTexture: *Thick and creamy*\n\nCurly Girl Method Approved?: *No*\n\nSilicone Free?: *Nope, contains* *Dimethicone, Amodimethicone, and Cyclopentasiloxane*\n\nAlcohol Free? : *No, contains Isopropyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, and Stearyl Alcohol*\n\nAfter one use, my hair is softer and feels smoother. After using it, I put my hair in a microfiber hair cap to air dry. My hair dried straight, instead of wavy. My hair looked more shiny and healthier than before. If you are looking to keep your natural hair texture, I don't recommend this product.\n\nSee full Curly Girl Method Ingredient Breakdown [here](https://isitcg.herokuapp.com/Home/Results/9TayIxixVkeoUwqp7FYTgw).\n\n**Shampoo Brush**\n\n[Shampoo Brush](https://preview.redd.it/ny21b01hl7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd0af98c4e7cf87aa0286fa46ad5ad045b6c42de)\n\nI bought this, because I do a lot of co-washes. I wanted to still be able to scrub my scalp clean, even though I don't use shampoo daily. I picked it up at Daiso for $1.50.\n\nThe bristles are made out of a rubber. It doesn't snag my hair, and I am able to brush through without issues. The handle is comfortable. It looks questionable, but for brushing your scalp it is perfect.\n\nMy scalp feels great when I use it. Using it feels like a little scalp massage. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I have noticed that my scalp doesn't feel as \"tight\" anymore. I really think it is helping, and I am glad I purchased it. I love using it, and will continue to use it.\n\n**Edit:** I forgot to mention that the shampoo brush is easier on my arthritic hands. It gives my scrubbing a little more power and doesn't hurt so much. \n\n**A'PIEU Healthy Scalp Doctor Tonic**\n\n[Hair Essence](https://preview.redd.it/1553s3nrm7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3eef80ce12cd882561d123de6c0b13fdbc61d116)\n\nI bought this for my dry scalp. I got it from Jolse for less than $10.\n\nI have been using it for a few months. It is used to treat over-oiled, itchy, dry scalp, and hair loss prevention. It contains Salicylic Acid, Peppermint, Rosemary, Menthol, and Allantoin. It is meant to be used after drying hair every other day. The bottle has a misting cap on it . You mist it directly to your scalp and massage throughout.\n\nOnce applied, it instantly feels cool, probably from the menthol. It does help keep the build up down, and my scalp doesn't have as much dander fallout.\n\nI think this would be better for oily skin. I won't be repurchasing, because I feel like I can find a better product suited for myself. I will use it up, and then try a mist from Innisfree.\n\nI was not able to find the full list of ingredients in English.\n\n**TONYMOLY Make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte**\n\n[Tonymoly make HD Hair Wax - Super Hard Matte](https://preview.redd.it/n5i87lbxq7811.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dceca026f002ac0b7f8e0c10a3433cfd1462733)\n\nI bought this for my husband. He has short fine black hair. He has some thinning and grays. His scalp is oily, and he has dandruff. I purchased this from Jolse for less than $5.\n\nHe does not care for it, but he says it isn't so bad that he will throw it away without finishing it. It doesn't hold as long as it suggests. It holds hair for about four hours. It dries matte. It doesn't leave a white cast, or white flakes. The color of the product is slightly gray. It has a strong scent of talcum. I will not be repurchasing this one, because the hold wasn't strong enough.",

    "body": "^*(last updated 4.5.14: they changed the trader joe's formula, it's off my list!)*\n\nConditioner only washing: washing your hair with conditioner only and cutting shampoo out of your regular routine. This is, as far as I can tell, the gentlest way to cleanse your hair. People with dry, damaged, or brittle hair may find this particularly beneficial, as well as people with very dry, sensitive or oily scalps (over production of oil can be a result of overdrying or irritation). Seems to be able to be adapted for any hair type. \n\nUPDATE: [A pic of my day 2 hair; about 2 months since my last shampoo](http://i.imgur.com/sSSrdLQ).\n\n[From this article on shampoo:](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002407/)  “Many persons feel that they do not have good hygiene unless they bathe daily. Technically, it is not necessary to shampoo the hair daily unless sebum production is high. Shampooing is actually more damaging to the hair shaft than beneficial.\" \n\n*****\n##How \n*****\nI CO-wash every 2-3 days, sometimes 4-5 if I'm using dry shampoo, deep condition my ends once every 1-2 weeks and before shampooing, and shampoo around every 4-6 weeks or when I get some kind of serious crud in my hair.  My scalp is also naturally oily, which means I'm always going to have to cleanse more often than people with dry scalps. When I first started doing it I CO-washed every day and shampooed weekly-biweekly, but the longer I do it, the longer I can go in between. A good dry shampoo can do wonders, too.  \n\n**Method**  \n\n 1. Thoroughly wet your hair, which can take a minute if your hair is low porosity or very thick.  \n\n 2. Get yourself a generous handful of conditioner and saturate your roots with it. Use the pads of your fingers (no nails) to massage the conditioner all over your scalp. Make sure you thoroughly massage every inch. This is easier with your head hanging upside down. Get some more conditioner if you need to, there's no such thing as too much.  \n\n 3. Rinsing after this step then working a second round of conditioner all through your hair is sometimes recommend. I've experimented and find it (personally) unnecessary. I just work some more conditioner into the length of my hair and finger comb it through. When I deep condition this is when I use it.  \n\n 4. Let your hair soak for the rest of your shower. I'll often take a bath and read for a while with the conditioner in my hair. Letting it sit for at least 5 minutes is an important part of the cleansing process; your oil needs time to dissolve into the conditioner.  \n\n 5. Thoroughly rinse your hair, massaging the scalp again as you do. Easier with your head upside down, but I'm not coordinated enough to keep the water from going up my nose so I just tilt my head way back and lift it in sections to help work my fingers through.  \n\n**Tips**  \n\n - Before you start this method, it's a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any build up. There are many ingredients in many haircare products that are difficult to remove and require stronger chemicals.  \n\n - Wash your face or anywhere you're concerned about acne/sensitive skin after you're done rinsing.  \n\n - If you're worried about an adjustment period, start out alternating CO-washing and shampooing with a gentle poo, and slowly increase the proportion of CO-washes.  \n\n - Comb through your hair with a wide toothed comb while the conditioner is in. It's easier to detangle and your hair is more elastic during this phase, which means less breakage, and it'll preserve your natural texture.  \n\n - Scratching/irritating/overheating your scalp causes it to produce more oil.  \n\n - I squeeze out all the excess moisture and let my hair air dry. A lot of others recommend drying with an old tshirt or microfiber towel. Terry cloth tends to rough up your hair and promote frizz and tangling.  \n\n*****\n##Why  \n*****\nThere are multiple ways this method can work to clean your hair. The first is by dissolution, the principle that oil dissolves oil. This is how the oil cleansing method works, which has been very popular in Asia for thousands of years, and historically they've placed a much higher value on hygiene than in the West. This is much gentler than surfactant based cleansing. The oils, humectants, and fatty alcohols in a good CO-wash bond to the oils on your scalp and roots (the soak), distribute them throughout your hair, and rinse away clean with gentle agitation (the scalp massage.)\n\nThe other way CO-washing can cleanse your hair is actually the same as shampoo: many conditioners still contain surfactants. I prefer to go mostly surfactant free, but some of them have certain benefits (just discovered [cetrimonium chloride](http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/curl-products/curlchemist-what-is-cetrimonium-chloride), [it's pretty spiffy](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1ls6zx/advice_on_a_heat_protectant_without_silicones_and/cc4h5r0), though I'm being cautious because there are some [allergen concerns](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/701258/CETRIMONIUM_CHLORIDE/)). Some surfactants have conditioning properties, lift the cuticle and allow it to absorb moisture, and some will lightly coat your hair, lending slip and shine.  \n\nWith this method it's VERY IMPORTANT to **avoid anything that builds up on your hair!** This means checking what's in the products you're putting on your hair and doing your research. **UPDATE:** Check out /u/smbtuckma's [guide on silicones](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) for more info on determining what will and won't work for your totally customizable routine! **Waxes** can build up and make your hair look dirty, particularly if it's fine; they can lend definition to curls though and are not drying. **Fatty alcohols** are emulsifiers (bind oil and water) and help provide slip to a conditioner, something you want, but can cause build up, particularly with waxy sebum, so they shouldn't be too high on the ingredient list; I haven't experienced an issue with them.\n\nQuick list of...\n\nDrying alcohols: Denatured alcohol, SD alcohol 40, Witch hazel, Isopropanol, Ethanol, SD alcohol, Propanol, Propyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol  \n\nFatty alcohols: Behenyl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, Isocetyl alcohol, Isostearyl alcohol, Lauryl alcohol, Myristyl alcohol, Stearyl alcohol, C30-50 Alcohols, Lanolin alcohol\n\n**Ingredients I look for:**  \n\n - **coconut oil** *(will actually penetrate your hair to moisturize, protects protein bonds, but usually very comedogenic; for more info on all the oils I mention check out [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) )*\n\n - **jojoba oil** \n\n - **sunflower oil** \n\n - **glycerin** (humectant)\n\n - **honey** (humectant, can lighten your hair/enhance highlights, be careful if you're worried about preserving your color; in it's raw form has strong antibacterial properties)\n\n - **aloe** (humectant; acidic, which helps remove mineral build up and seal the cuticle; contains protein(amino acids), if your hair starts to show signs of [protein overload](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html)(crunchy, brittle, less elastic) cut back; extremely under studied with highly contradictory information out there, so experiment for yourself and draw your own conclusions)\n\n - **cetrimonium chloride** (cationic surfactant, increases tensile strength when combined with heat)\n\n - **panthenol** (significantly improves shine and manageability)\n\n*****\n##Who  \n*****\nAs far as I can tell, this method can work for pretty much anyone as long as you're willing to experiment to find the right conditioner. My scalp is oily, my hair is extremely fine, low porosity, bleached, dyed, henna-ed, dry, and extremely fragile. This method cleanses my scalp and roots thoroughly and nourishes my length, leaving everything soft, shiny, stronger than it ever has been in my life, and really enhances my natural texture. My scalp also seems to be producing a LOT less oil than with any other method I've tried. I've seen glowing write ups on this method with every hair texture, thickness, and density; from what I can tell it started with the curly community.\n\nThe biggest obstacle seems to be **knowing your hair type** and what works for it:  \n\n - Fine or thin hair is going to need a very light product that rinses very clean.  \n\n - Chemically colored hair will eventually be stripped by oils that penetrate your hair (coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower seed oil) so should avoid those in regularly used products\n\n - Low porosity hair doesn't like too much protein (makes it crunchy, brittle, less elastic; this is specifically in reference to hydrolyzed protein, other types won't absorb) and seems to need an extra boost from humectants to absorb moisture, especially since (if you opt for a surfactant free route) you're no longer lifting the cuticle to help it. Still needs some protein/strengthening treatments,  you have to find a balance for your hair [More on this over at Curly Nikki](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/can-i-over-condition.html).  \n\n - High porosity hair typically loves hydrolyzed protein (you need that word to be in front of the protein ingredient for it to be absorbant) and much more readily absorbs, and loses, whatever you put on it. Needs more attention from products that coat/seal in moisture and smooth the cuticle. \n\n - Wetter/oilier sebum is the easiest to remove and really lends itself to this method.  \n\n - Thicker/waxier sebum might do better with a conditioner that contains more emulsifiers, such as surfactants. Jojoba oil is also a good ingredient to look for, because of it's chemical structure it can really effectively penetrate and combine with what's on your scalp. I've read that build up from fatty alcohols is particularly an issue with waxy sebum.  \n\n*I would love to hear some feedback on waxier sebum and high porosity hair!*\n\n**I do NOT recommend this method to anyone experiencing issues with dandruff.** Dandruff is often a fungal infection called melassazia in your scalp's yeasts. I recommend visiting a doctor or certified trichologist to find out your cause; I've read about successfully treating it naturally with raw honey, coconut oil, aloe, hemp oil, and tea tree oil, but this really all depends on what kind of dandruff you're dealing with, and a lot of the evidence is anecdotal or under studied.  \n\n*****\n##What  \n*****\nCO-Washing:  \n\n - **Mane n' Tail Conditioner** *(wow, gotta say, this stuff might be my new favorite! Contains cationic surfactants (good, conditioning ones), coconut oil, glycerin, and hydrolyzed protein. I've been alternating it with the Trader Joe's conditioner lately, and myt hair has been perceptibly healthier.

        "author": "ihatespunk",
        "body": "So, /u/SnooSnooCookie asked me about a specific conditioner, [Matrix Total Results Color Care Conditioner](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?um=1&safe=off&client=firefox-a&hs=G7g&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=878&tbm=isch&tbnid=1Qc4icCLLeYB4M:&imgrefurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/shopping/DYH0200911KK0158.htm&docid=vQoU3xg8hp02dM&imgurl=http://www.beautyofnewyork.com/upload/2011/matrix-total-results-color-care-soin-couleur-conditioner-10-1.jpg&w=221&h=550&ei=7rktUrOVBIbPkQWjmoCwCA&zoom=1&ved=1t:3588,r:1,s:0,i:80&iact=rc&page=1&tbnh=194&tbnw=80&start=0&ndsp=30&tx=10&ty=102), for COwashing. Here's a break down of it with some helpful resources for you guys.\n\nGenerally, I'll just google the ingredients in a product one by one; eventually you start to remember what's good and what's bad.  I'd say MAYBE it'd be a suitable COwash, but I think you can do a lot better, especially for the price. Here's the ingredients list:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetyl Esters, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Alcohol, Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone, Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Linalool, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Dodecene, Poloxamer 407, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone \n\n -  Cetearyl Alcohol is a fatty alcohol, meaning it's moisturizing. Fatty alcohols cause build up issues for some people, particularly those with waxy sebum. I prefer to see them farther down the ingredient list, things are listed in the order of largest quantity to smallest, but this isn't a deal breaker; lots of frequently recommended COwash are very heavy on fatty alcohols. \n\n -  Behentrimonium Chloride is an emulsifier (binds oil and water), antistatic agent, and mild cationic surfactant. Basically, this means it will both condition and clean your hair. Popular ingredient in co-wash conditioners (I, personally, am super sensitive to surfactants so avoid them, but most people don't have this issue.)\n\n -  Glycerin is a humectant (attracts water) and one of my favorite hair care ingredients. Be careful of it in leave ins if you're in a low humidity climate, without other products or humidity to provide moisture it'll actually attract water out of the interior of your hair. In a co-wash, this helps both clean and moisturize your hair.\n\n -  Cetyl Esters are a wax used to thicken products, waxes can build up on your hair and make it look dirty after awhile. This may not be an issue if you're hair isn't easily weighed down (mine is) and in combination with the behentrimonium chloride. Only way to know is trial and error.\n\n -  Isopropyl Myristate is used as an emollient and helps make a product slippery (a good thing for COwashing), however I'm finding conflicting information on it and nothing solid about it's application to hair. Generally, it's an accepted moisturizer, however there's solid information on it's potential for irritation and clogging pores. There's also some discussion that it can be drying. I dunno. This is a confusing one. I'd just try to avoid it.\n\n -  Isopropyl Alcohol is a drying alcohol. It's difficult to avoid drying alcohols entirely, but good to do if you can. You definitely don't want it this high in an ingredient list. [This page has a handy list of drying alcohols, fatty alcohols, and silicones](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Parfum/Fragrance is the bane of my existence. I'm usually super sensitive to it. It can mean almost anything, companies aren't required to report their personal fragrance blends, so they're frequently drying/irritating. They're also in freaking everything. Damn near impossible to avoid, so just aim for low on the ingredient list.\n\n -  Phenoxyethanol is a preservative, it keeps your product from getting moldy.\n\n -  Lauryl PEG/PPG 18/18 Methicone is a silicone; generally, silicones are the top thing you want to avoid with COwashing. This one, however, is a [water soluble silicone](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/08/water-soluble-silicones-101.html), so it MAY be ok to use with this method. There's really conflicting information about the role that cones play in hair care, some studies say they only simulate the appearance of health and block the absorption of moisture, others say they help protect hair from heat damage and can help act as humectants. The only way to know what works for you is trial and error. I would think that, combined with surfactants, water soluble silicones MIGHT be ok for SOME people. I don't mess around with them because my hair is so easily weighed down. Again, [this page has a handy list of which silicones are and aren't water soluble](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-a-Hair-Product-is-Curly-Girl-Approved).\n\n -  Helianthus Annuss Seed Oil / Sunflower Seed Oil is a moderately penetrative oil, which means usually it's a GREAT ingredient for hair care and COwashing. However, penetrative oils can strip hair dye; proceed with caution.\n\n -  Tocopherol is vitamin E, it acts as a moisturizer and preservative.\n\n -  Linalool is a fragrance and byproduct of essential oils and vitamin E, generally not a concern unless you have eczema and it oxidizes.\n\n -  Chlorhexidine Digluconate is probably being used as a preservative here, it has antiseptic/antimicrobial properties. Some moderate risk for irritation.\n\n -  Citric Acid is an acidifier and preservative. Also removes hard water build up. Moderate acidity is great for hair care, it helps close the cuticle = make your hair shinier.\n\n -  Benzyl Salicylate related to salicylic acid, generally used as a fragrance ingredient. Some concerns about potential for irritation/developing a sensitivity to it over time.\n\n -  Limonene is used primarily as a fragrance in toiletry products; used commercially as a solvent, ie it strips oils. Some concerns about irritation and developing sensitivities to it.\n\n -  Butylphenyl Methylpropional is a fragrance with irritation and endocrine disruption concerns. It's use is heavily restricted.\n\n -  Dodecene is a known skin irritant, appears to be used as a thickener. Primarily used in the manufacturing of detergents.\n\n -  Poloxamer 407 is a gentle non-ionic surfactant. It's also hydrophilic, which means it attracts water molecules. Good ingredient for COwashing.\n\n -  Hexyl Cinnamal is a fragrance with some irritation and allergen concerns. Safe in small amounts (this qualifies).\n\n -  Citronellol is a fragrance with sensitizing concerns.\n\n -  Benzyl Alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with solvent properties, used as a preservative. Not a concern in small quantities.\n\n -  Alpha-Iso-Methyl Ionone is a fragrance with some allergen concerns in large quantities.",

I've had a pretty oily scalp my whole life, and I am used to waking up and starting my day with a shower/washing my hair. I have never been the type that could wash my hair at night and then just get up and go in the morning. But now, I see that as being one of the many perks/benefits of this COwashing method! But here is my question - how in the world do you sleep on your hair so that it is still wearable the next day?? Not referring to the oily hair, which would be diminished by this new hair-washing technique, but the crazy, tangly roughed-up looking hair that I wake up with? Any tips or advice on this? Like I said, I feel silly asking about this, but I cant remember a time where I didnt wake up and shower first thing in the morning before going to school/work, so I've never had to worry or think about \"bed head\".

At what point should I use the clarifying shampoo again? \n\nAlso you mentioned the Trader Joe’s conditioner but they make several, which one do you recommend? Thanks! \n\nCurrently I only clean my hair every other day. Should I be I washing everyday or is every other day cowashing/shampooing ok? \n\nI excersize often and my hair gets very sweaty.

Some retailers have the ingredients list with zinc oxide only, and then the official packaging and website say its a chemical sunscreen (both english and korean), and also, the official packaging also lists fragrance just above carbomer (from the naver posts that i saw), whereas the official korean website ingredients list has fragrance at the bottom of the ingredients list, maybe bc of different ingredients list laws in korea…. lol idk anymore its confusing.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao.

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the '🐳' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\n🔹 **MORNING ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n🐳 Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   🐳Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    🐳Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\n🔹 **NIGHT ROUTINE** 🔹\n\n    \n   🐳Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  🐳Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   🐳Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    🐳Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    🐳Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\n🔵 **CLEANSER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\n🐳 **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\n🐳 **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n🐳 **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\n🐳 **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ✨ *manifestion* ✨ and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\n🔵 **TONER** 🔵\n\n🔹 **DermaFique All Important Toner** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\n🐳 **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\n🐳 **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\n🔵 **SERUM** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (⚠️ensure the dropper doesn't touch your face⚠️) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n🐳 **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\n🐳 **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔹 **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n🐳 **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\n🐳 **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\n🔵 **MOISTURIZER** 🔵\n\n🔹**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice; Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\n🐳 **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\n🔹 **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n🐳 **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\n🐳 **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\n🐳 **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n🔵 **SUNSCREEN** 🔵\n\n🔹 **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** 🔹\n\n🐳 **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\n🐳 **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\n🐳 **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\n🐳 **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\n🐳 **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you! Rest your eyes for a bit,it did endure quite a bit of a strain with this one :P",

It was a recommendation from a Thai friend, apparently it’s super popular in SE Asia. It’s manufactured by the same parent company and has a similar ingredient list with Bifida Lystate as the 2nd ingredient. \nThe only con for me is that it has alcohol in it. But if you’re ok with it then it’s a super good serum for like 1/4 the cost of ANR.",

As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\n# Product Itself (Before Trying)\n\n**At a Glance (before opening)**:\n\n* Product size is 11.5 oz. / 326 g.\n* Product states that it is formulated with no parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, or petrolatum.\n* Product states that it is not tested on animals, is cruelty free, is ethically traded/sustainably sourced, comes from a certified corporation, is family founded, and is created with fair trade shea butter.\n   * [What does \"fair trade\" mean?](https://www.greenerchoices.org/fair-trade-certified/)\n* Product states that it is manufactured in the USA using globally-sourced ingredients.\n* Product jar itself is made from 35% recycled plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Description on Container**: \"Our Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream provides definition with a soft, flexible hold.  Formulated with Manuka Honey, Yogurt, and Fair Trade Shea Butter, this lightweight curl cream also hydrates and helps strengthen hair to reduce breakage while styling.  Experience significantly less breakage when used as the fifth and last step in the Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Directions For Use on Container**: \"After generously spraying hair with the MANUKA HONEY & YOGURT HYDRATE + REPAIR MULTI-ACTION LEAVE-IN, apply to clean, damp hair and work through.  Style as desired and air dry or diffuse to finish your look.  This is the ultimate finish to the Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair regimen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients as Listed on Container**: \"Water (Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin (Vegetable), VP/VA Copolymer, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Carbomer, Honey (Miel), Yogurt Extract, Yogurt Powder, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter, Inulin (Chicory Root), Sorbitan Olivate, Sodium Hydroxide, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Sodium Phylate, Triethyl Citrate, Caprylyl Glycol, Benzoic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance (Parfum)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredient Breakdown (with the help of the \"Is it CG?\" Engine):**\n\n1. Product contains two humectants: Glycerin (Vegetable) and Honey (Miel).\n   1. *Humectants absorb moisture and help balance dry and damaged hair, but humectants also pull moisture from the environment too.  It is advised to use humectants with caution if you live in environments are hot and dry.*\n2. Product contains two oils:  Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil and  Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter.\n   1. *Oils are good at coating hair strands in order to seal moisture, but should be used with caution as they may build up over time (especially if you cowash).  It is advised to use a clarifying shampoo occasionally (about ever 2 weeks) to remove buildup that oils may cause.*\n3. Product contains a conditioning agent: Caprylyl Glycol.\n   1. *In this case, this conditioning agent is working as a film-forming ingredient over the hair.  Conditioning agents are water soluble but have potential to build up over time (can clean with clarifying shampoo, see note in oils for more info).*\n4. Product contains a moisturizing alcohol: Cetearyl Alcohol.\n   1. *Alcohols are generally added to hair products to improve their ability to penetrate hair.  This alcohol is considered a moisturizing alcohol, so it will not dry hair.*\n5. Product contains three botanical ingredients: Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Adansonia Digitata (Baobab) Seed Oil, and Trichilia Emetica (Mafura) Seed Butter.\n   1. *Botanical ingredients are ingredients that are derived from plants.  Botanical ingredients generally help with cleansing, stimulating, nourishing, refreshing, soothing, moisturizing, normalizing, and deodorizing.*\n6. Product contains two preservatives: Benzoic Acid and Phenoxyethanol.\n   1. *Preservatives prevent growth of bacteria and micro-organisms in your product.*\n7. Product has fragrance.\n   1. *Fragrance is generally okay to use on hair.  People with scalp sensitivities or allergies to fragrance should avoid fragrance in products.*\n8. Product *may* contain a protein, but this would be a light protein if so: Yogurt Extract and Yogurt Powder.\n   1. *I am honestly not sure if this is a protein, but when looking up online, some sources do say that yogurt contains protein.  If this is a protein, it is likely a very weak form of protein that would not impact your hair too much (honestly, it would still probably be less protein than the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie, which contains silk protein).*\n\nHere is the full breakdown using the [\"is it CG?\"](http://www.isitcg.com/view/TZFBb9swDIX_CuHDYGMOeu8t8dJ1hyBGUqQY0AttszFRWTRoaYs27L-PyrKiN9N6j_z4-LvwxX1xHAlhJ7yEqAQ79PEN4VE8JfgE3-UcNcBL8ZgGxUDwGQ40Iys8jzzPNEAT1UGjhNNLUdQFW8dnEyqUW4xVDQ0FQk0O1q6XUVwNX13qSdlDeaIzBewcme7U3p3W0MgsLk2kNeydcW2jyoz2Ue4d_6AKHjRygD1bnwP37ONinmmKnhcoG1yCaAVHMrCr5n16thtWDZsYksoyk05xghb1jRnKHEKV34zcmFE7uUL8y6HcMTljvKWxvQTFPrzXrfwcsm09oF_EM8IXPnPAYNgblA67j0hPyv3IzlTbiQL3Jtrha1Sbf-X-D_HNR5dDakbuRRMcRIIxHEU76-0tn9tGRxnYVskXkgsPtmNLPiBpCqNysOifyIBXA6_CqrP13U2bxmyxED1O12xundoxuWttqBSsgIatQU6vwdluaX_yEfMxN-R_Cfew7nmwwSN5uSQzoc-vD4pnRd8TlJb0a5yq4s9f) engine.  I recommend using this engine even if you do not use the CG method because it lets you see what ingredients do what to your hair.  \n\n**Overall Impression Based on These Factors:**\n\nThis is my impression BEFORE trying the product.  Overall, this product sounds like a great replacement for those who are looking for a lightweight, protein-free (at least, from my analysis) curl cream.  I think this product would be a great alternative for those who liked the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but didn’t like the protein and weight that the Curl Smoothie had.  This product does have glycerin in it, which I know some hair types are sensitive to, so that could be a turn off for some people.  This product has a lot of moisturizing ingredients in it, so it will probably benefit those seeking moisture for their hair the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Information About the Hair this Product is Tested on (My Hair)\n\n**Curl type**: 3A \n\n**Porosity**: Medium-High \n\n**Width**: Fine \n\n**Length**: Somewhere between 12-24 inches \n\n**Density**: lower-normal \n\n**Damage**: I may have a little protein damage on my hair (may have overdid it with a rice wash), but other than that it is mostly healthy.  Last cut was a little over 3 weeks ago.  Last clarify wash was a week ago.  I generally have halo frizz around my scalp area which I am currently combatting with the upside-down shower method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Other Products Used with this Product and Application Methods Used\n\n**Note**: All products are CG approved.  These are all the products I used on the day I tried this product.  I wash my hair every other day.\n\n**Pre-Treatment**: dampen hair, detangle with a little bit of the Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt conditioner, scrunch out some wetness, apply overnight oil (sweet almond oil, olive oil, rosemary oil, tea tree oil mixture) and sleep with a processing cap on.\n\n**Shampoo**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Shampoo\n\n**Conditioner**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Conditioner\n\n**Deep Conditioner**: Raw Sugar Healing Power Hair Masque with Avocado Oil + Banana + Coconut Milk + Agave\n\n**Leave-in**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Multi-Action Leave-in\n\n**Curl Cream**: Shea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Hydrate + Repair Whipped Curl Cream (this product)\n\n**Gel**: Kinky Curly Original Curling Custard\n\n**Cast-breaker**: Shea Moisture 100% Argan Oil\n\n**Tools**: WetBrush Wet Brush, Microfiber head wraps (I use them as towels to scrunch), Xtava Black Orchid Diffuser, InfinityPro by Con Air Drier, my hands (for scrunching)\n\n**Method**: Wet hair while leaning forward (back of head facing ceiling and hair pointing down).  Shampoo roots while leaving forward and use praying hands to run shampoo over the rest of the hair.  Rinse leaning forward.  Apply conditioner leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute in product, squish to condish while leaning forward.  Let sit for 2-4 minutes.  Rinse while leaning forward.  Apply deep conditioner while leaning forward and use a wet brush to distribute product.  Let sit for 8-15 minutes.  Squish to condish and leave a little in hair when finishing.  While leaning forward, apply leave-in and curl cream by using praying hands and then scrunching upwards.  Scrunch some of the moisture out of hair with a microfiber cloth, then praying hands + scrunch in gel.  Diffuse with Xtava’s Black Orchid diffuser on low heat low (\"cool\") speed, let hair sit for a couple minutes and scrunch out the cast with Shea Moisture’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# First Impressions After Opening Product\n\nThe smell of the product is quite nice and very low-key.  It smells like the rest of this line if you have ever tried it.  The consistency is almost like lotion (if you have ever used Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, think of that texture/look/consistency).  On a side note, the safety seal was INSANE to take off, so you’ll *definitely* know if someone tampered with your product.  When compared to the curl smoothie, the curl smoothie is a lot more “coagulated” (idk how else really to describe it) versus this product, so this whipped curl cream definitely gives the appearance of being lighter than the curl smoothie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Thoughts During Application\n\nI applied this product while upside down (leaning forward so that the back of my head faced the ceiling and my hair pointed downward) and with near soaking wet hair by running a small amount on my hands down the top of my head first (not raking in).  After that, I applied a little more to my hands and used prayer hands to apply it down the length of my hair.  Something interesting I noticed while doing this was that the cream seemed to soak in immediately, like, in literal seconds.  At first I thought I wasn't using enough product, but as I continued using prayer hands around my hair I noticed that the product melted in all around my head.  When I scrunched after using praying hands, I noticed that the curls seemed quite defined (I had a little wet frizz, but this is nothing out of the ordinary for me).  The smell was very pleasant and didn't bother me at all during the application.  Something else I noticed was that this product didn't provide the same \"slip,\" or slippery feeling, that the curl smoothie did.  This may be because it wasn't as heavy as the curl smoothie, but it did leave my hair with its normal, slightly rougher texture that I normally feel (it felt like how wet hair feels without any product added).  I kind of actually liked this, since to me that was proof that it wasn't going to weigh my hair down and didn't create a film over the hair that brought it down, but I could still tell it was working because of how well my hair was holding a curl while wet.  Overall, I probably used a little over a quarter's worth (maybe a half-dollar coin's worth) of product, which for me is more than I'd use for the curl smoothie but less than I thought I'd have to use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Results\n\n**Before Scrunching:** As I am sitting here letting my hair settle after diffusing, I am looking at my hair and noticing the amount of volume it has now before breaking the cast that I do not normally get.\n\n**After Scrunching:** Holy volume Batman!  So after scrunching, I noticed that my curls definitely look softer than they normally do with the curl smoothie.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing at the moment, so I'll have to see how my hair holds up for the rest of the day.  The cast I had wasn't entirely crunchy, so I may not have diffused for long enough which could also be the culprit, but unknown.  My hair smells sooooo good but is not overwhelming, which is nice.  My hair also feels a lot softer after having scrunched, so it looks like the cream doesn't turn your hair super rough.  [Here is what my hair looked like after I scrunched it (not my closet, sorry for the clutter in the background).](https://imgur.com/a/T08BGx3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Final Verdict\n\n**Disclaimer**: I am only one person, and this is only one product review.  As such, this review is based on my experience with the product and may differ (for better or worse) with other experiences or your own experience.  I hope that this honest review of the product will help you to decide whether or not you think this product will work well for yourself.\n\nMaybe it is still too soon to tell, but I really, *really* like this cream after this first wash.  It didn't make my finer hair feel weighed down after a shower, and I didn't have to be super careful to not overdo it during application like I normally have to do for the curl smoothie.  My hair feels softer and less \"wet\" than it normally does after I scrunch the crunch, which may be due to my gel or this curl cream, but either way I'm liking it.  Now that my hair is crunched, it feels extremely bouncy (like, I'm bouncing in the mirror just to see how it bounces) and lightweight.  I don't know how it will hold up in the elements, since I haven't gone outside, but for now it looks great.\n\nConsidering the price for the amount of product, it seems like a pretty good deal.  The Whipped Curl Cream's container is 11.5 oz (interestingly enough, the curl smoothie is 12 oz, so it looks like someone at Shea Moisture wanted to be funny).  I bought the tub for $12, so it looks like that is nearly a dollar per ounce, which I consider to be good for the price.  I didn't have to use a ton of product to get the result I did, so I anticipate this tub lasting me at least 6 months if not longer.  \n\nThe smell and consistency were great in my opinion.  The product didn't feel \"goopy\" like the curl smoothie and essentially melted into my hair, which I was totally not expecting.  This is probably due to the \"whipped\" nature of the product, as products marketed as \"whipped\" tend to be lighter and absorbed easily.  The smell was not overpowering, and I actually kind of preferred it over the curl smoothie to be honest (after a while, the curl smoothie begins to smell like over scented baby-powder/diapers to me).\n\nOverall, I think this product is *definitely* worth checking out if you are looking for a lightweight curl cream, have used the Shea Moisture Curl Smoothie but feel weighed down by it, or are looking for a curl cream for finer hair.  The price is good, the product looks good, and I am very happy with the results.  \n\nI hope this review may have helped some of you curlies out there!  Good luck on your curl journey :)\n\n# After a Week Update\n\nGood morning y’all!  So it’s been a week since I bought this product and I’ve had some time to see how it performs with my hair.  I’ll start by saying I think that it’s done well for my hair in that it is so lightweight, but sometimes I still find it hard to style my hair without that “coating” the curl smoothie gave me.  I have noticed that I’ve had a bit more wet frizz than normal, which I had a really bad buildup episode so it could be that or this cream, but I’m really not sure.  I’ve still also noticed that my hair seems to become a bit more frizzy when I scrunch the crunch, but I have a funny feeling that that’s due to the new gel I tried and not this cream, but it could be.  Here is a pros and cons list of what I’ve noticed over the past couple days:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. Product is very light weight and clearly does not weigh down my hair.\n2. Product forms wet curls well when scrunched in (but may need a strong-hold gel after to keep them).\n3. Product smells great (I prefer it way more than the curl smoothie).\n4. Price point for product is very affordable.\n\n**Cons:**\n1. Product may not be able to support certain curl types without more hold (I have 3a hair, may work better for wavier hair but this could also be a gel problem).\n2. You will need to use more product than expected to get results.\n3. Product may contribute to wet frizz (my hair had a ton of buildup so this may have contributed too)\n4. This is not a curl cream that you can probably add in and then walk out for the day, it will most likely require a gel to help the hold.\n\nOverall, I’d rate it 7.5/10.  It’s worked really well for my hair, and this rating could go up when I try swapping my strong-hold gel back into my routine and see if it was the cream or the gel that isn’t holding my hair.  The product makes my hair so soft once my routine is done and doesn’t weigh my finer width hair down, but I do have to use more product than I normally did with the SM CS.  I’m definitely going to use up the rest of this jar, and I still highly recommend this to people who are looking for a lightweight curl cream to try.  Unfortunately, there is no sample size containers out there and I did email Shea Moisture asking about samples, but they essentially told me to take a hike so that was a no.  Regardless, if you are able to get your hands on this product, I think it is definitely worth a try!",

        "body": "Thank you so much for your extremely thorough original post, and for the update. Your hair looks great!\n\nI have somewhat similar hair, have been experimenting with products for a while, and have yet to find any holy grail products. Reviews like this help a lot!\n\nI used to have such a simple hair routine, several years ago. I’d occasionally shampoo with T-Gel for scalp issues, but would normally cowash with a conditioner (not CG) and use a little of the same stuff as a leave in, then scrunch with a T-shirt and air dry. Depending on how badly I needed a haircut, I wouldn’t need any styling product until refreshing, and my hair would have good clumpy ringlets up front and a good wave in the back on my short-ish style. But then my perfect conditioner was discontinued. My hair has never looked as good with so little effort since. \n\nIt’s improved a lot since this round with CG, mostly due to this sub. My curls can get curlier and the waves in the back are sometimes curls, but my hair seems really sensitive to both protein and humidity. I’m in the Pacific Northwest, so we can get a lot of humidity! I’m also sensitive or allergic to a ton of scents used in hair products, so that limits what I can try. \n\nSorry to rant all over your wonderful product review. You’ve actually helped with some of my curly hair frustrations because I think I’m going to try this curl cream.",

    "body": "I'm back with another review of a product I don't see too often around here! In case you missed the previous reviews, here are [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/) and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). As always, questions and criticism about the reviews are welcome!\n\n**Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream**\n\nIf you know me, then you know that finding a good moisturizer has been the bane of my existence. I've tried Nivea Soft, Cosrx Honey Ceramide Full Moisture Cream, Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, and FAB Ultra Repair Cream, all within the past few months, and none of them have felt right for my dry, acne-prone, and sometimes dehydrated skin. Nivea Soft changes its ingredients depending on the country, and with the amount I move, I don't want to patch test every time I buy a new tub. Holika Holika was good, but a bit sticky, and I'm wary of the botanical extracts in the reformulation. Cosrx was too greasy, while FAB was too dry. It's a veritable Goldilocks and the Three Bears situation but with moisturizers instead of porridge. \n\nEnter my \"just right\" moisturizer: Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. This is the first moisturizer I'm actually happy enough with to repurchase, and that says a lot about what a great product it is. \n\n**Packaging:** I'm a sucker for Glossier's minimalist white and millennial pink vibe. So it's no surprise that I love the packaging of the two Missha products currently on my shelf. The Total Ceramide Cream comes in a 50ml white metal tube with a small plastic screw-on cap and black text. It would probably look starkly medical if it weren't for the pink bands near the end of the tube that make it vaguely minimalist chic. Do I purposefully nestle this product between my Milky Jelly Cleanser and my pink and white Missha sunscreen? Absolutely. \n\nAesthetics aside, the tube is actually one of my least favorite things about the cream. While it's a nice size, and I appreciate the fact that it's not plastic, it's like a tube of toothpaste in that it flattens out the more you use. I still have about half a tube left to go, but I expect it'll be difficult to get every last drop of moisturizer out. I also have read some reviews where people's tubes ripped open when they got bent. I have a trip coming up in two weeks, and will be interested in seeing how it fares in my carry-on.\n\n**Ingredients:** A cosDNA analysis of this product shows it to be relatively clean. The three acne triggers that pop up are Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, and hydrogenated vegetable oil, which rate 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As for good things, the cream contains three different types of ceramides: Ceramide 3, Ceramide 9, and Ceramide AP, as well as shea butter and meadowfoam seed oil, all of which are towards the top or middle of the ingredients list. So as long as you have no sensitivities with any of the ingredients, this should be a pretty good moisturizer for anyone with dry skin or who is trying to repair their moisture barrier. \n\nOne really interesting thing about the Total Ceramide Cream is that is contains Maltobionic Acid, a PHA. PHAs are chemical exfoliants that are supposedly as effective as AHAs, but without the sensitizing effects, due to their larger molecular structure ([Source](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/exfoliant/polyhydroxy-acid.html)). So theoretically, this cream should have some brightening properties, just like an AHA. I was definitely worried trying this out, because even though PHAs are gentle, the idea of putting any kind of chemical exfoliant into a product marketed for people with compromised moisture barriers made me wary.\n\nHere is the full ingredients list as printed on the side of the box: \n\nWater, Glycerin, Caprylic ICapric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Sorbitan Olivate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Ceramide NP, Phytosteryl/octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide AP, Carbomer, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Maltobionic Acid, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Tromethamine, Lecithin, Trideceth-10, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n**Price:** $14 on Jolse, which works out to about 28 cents per milliliter, making this the second least expensive moisturizer I've tried thus far. \n\n**Use and Performance:** The texture of the Total Ceramide Cream is unlike any moisturizer I've used before. It's closest to the pudding-like texture of the Holika Holika Skin & Good Cera Super Cream, but it's slightly stiffer, and a little less sticky. Its appearance is also a bit translucent--not as opaque as a typical cream, but nowhere near as transparent as a typical gel. \n\nI actually had a really difficult time with this moisturizer the first few days, and thought it was going to be a repeat of my Cosrx debacle all over again, where the moisturizer just sat in a greasy layer on top of my face refusing to sink in. I immediately started frantically googling PHAs and dry skin, because I react pretty badly to glycolic acid, and was worried that the maltobionic acid was the culprit keeping my skin from absorbing the moisture. In the end, I decided to stick with it and give the Total Ceramide Cream a slightly longer trial run before calling it quits.\n\n I'm very happy I pushed through though, because on the fourth day, my face finally stopped looking greasy as the cream sunk in and made my skin soft and moisturized. I think the difference is that I let my last hydrating layer dry down a bit more than usual before applying a facial oil or Stratia Liquid Gold followed by the cream. It might have also been just a weird weather-related fluke, but I haven't had any problems since then. This product leaves me thoroughly moisturized, and it's very rare that I need to reapply it throughout the day, which I've had to do with other moisturizers (I'm looking at you, FAB). My skin definitely looks brighter, but I'm skeptical about chalking that up to the maltobionic acid when I've recently seen some really great progress on my acne and PIE with Finacea. So maybe it's the cream, maybe it's the azaleic acid. Either way, I'm just happy the PHA in the cream isn't getting in the way of its moisturizing abilities. \n\nIn terms of texture, there's no sticky residue left on my face, making it appropriate for daytime use. It leaves a dewy finish, which is perfect because I rarely wear complexion makeup but still like a slightly luminous effect. And speaking of foundation, the few times I've used makeup over the Total Ceramide Cream, I've had no issues with pilling. \n\nThere are a few drawbacks: we recently had a cold snap in the UK, and I found that I had to reapply this moisturizer a bit more than I might have with Nivea or Holika Holika. I've also noticed that if I go too heavy on the azaleic acid, it's not quite enough to help with the dryness either. So it's definitely not for extra dry days, but works well for my skin's usual level of dryness. I've also found it very easy to use too much of this product. I'm used to having to apply large amounts of moisturizer on my face to keep the dryness at bay. However, a little bit of this product goes a long way, and I went through like a third of the tube in only two weeks because I didn't realize I could get away with using less. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream is the first moisturizer that I will happily repurchase (rather than begrudgingly repurchasing Nivea Soft *again* because I can't find anything I actually like). My skin feels happy and moisturized using this product, and I love the way it makes my skin look dewy and fresh. \n\nThis is probably not the right moisturizer for you if your skin is very dehydrated or you're dealing with some exceptional dryness. It's also probably not going to be a good option for people with oily skin, given the dewy finish. However, if you have dry to normal skin and are looking to add some ceramides or a PHA to your routine at a relatively modest price point, then I highly recommend Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream. \n\n**My Rating: 4.5/5**",

It's an introduction to haircare that will help most people, but it may not give you all the results you want or may create atypical effects. If you want a more personalized haircare regimen, check out our guide on [common problem troubleshooting](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1km6ui/troubleshooting_common_problems/), visit our [product recommendations page](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/product_reviews), or post a question thread.\n\nThe basic process for caring for hair is cleansing, conditioning, drying, and then styling. In other words, it is the process of cleaning the hair, protecting it, drying it, and then getting it into the shape you want. Fulfilling you and your hair's needs in these four areas is the objective of a good haircare procedure.\n\n**Cleansing**\n\nMany commercial shampoos have harsh surfactants that degrade the cuticle through abrasion and excessive oil extraction and can even sever protein bonds in the cortex underneath [1][6][9][10]. They function primarily as foamers, emulsifiers (so oils and water can exist in the same bottle without separating), and oil extractors [11]. However they are often used in excess because many people believe in the myth that shampoos with more foam and that leave the hair squeaky clean are better [1][6]. While these harsh surfactants do clean the hair better, our hair doesn't need to be cleaned that well that often. Because of the significant cuticle damage caused by frequent use of these surfactants over time, here are our alternate recommendations:\n\n- buy a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner duo as a starting point. If you’re used to using harsh shampoos, it may take time to adjust to the gentler formula so be patient. \n\n- Try not to wash your hair every day. This strips the natural oils from your scalp that are produced to lubricate the hair shaft and exposes your hair to more damaging agents [6]. However, it is also possible to [exacerbate any scalp conditions you have](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/668qkd/scalpama_we_are_a_team_of_scientists_working_in/) by not washing *enough*. Wash cycles will be a very personal thing, so experiment with different lengths of time in between washes for a couple weeks to see what works for you. On off days you can keep your hair dry, wet and massage it in the shower, or wash with conditioner.\n\n- If this still feels too harsh for your hair, check out [co-washing](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m0g7c/conditioner_only_method_cowashing/). This is a method of cleaning and nourishing the hair only with conditioner and is helpful for people with excessively fragile and dry hair and sensitive scalps. \n\n- If you're co-washing or use any styling products, also use a stronger clarifying shampoo every few weeks\n\nFor more details on different kinds of cleansing, check out [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1vw6sz/big_giant_super_basic_eli5_guide_to_cleansing/) post. \n\n**Conditioning**\n\nConditioners protect the hair by smoothing down the cuticle, which reduces the chance for damage and makes the hair shaft softer, more combable, and more manageable [3][4]. It also reduces moisture loss. Conditioners can be applied in the shower, after washing while hair is wet or dry, and in a concentrated amount as a deep conditioner before washing. You may find benefit by using one kind, or all three depending on your hair's susceptibility to damage (e.g. it's thinner, you heat style, you live at higher elevations with more UV exposure, etc.) and porosity. \n\n- In-shower conditioners are the most common and are often formulated as part of a pair with a shampoo. \n\n- Leave-in conditioners, or conditioners you add after washing, are very helpful if you plan on doing any sort of styling. Look for something light if you have thin hair that is weighed down easily, like a thin liquid or a spray that doesn't have heavy silicones or other conditioners. Thicker hair can stand up to and may even require heavier conditioners like cremes or liquids with more viscosity. \n\n- Finally, deep conditioners typically have the strongest effect, hence their name. If your hair still feels dry or rough, try a commercial or natural deep conditioner formula once every one to two weeks. Depending on the amount of conditioning you're looking for and what ingredients you use, you can put it on for a few minutes in the shower, apply it all over your head a couple hours before a wash, or apply it at night, sleep on it using a shower cap or old towel, and wash it out in the morning. Warming the deep conditioner before application increase penetrative abilities for those who have low-porosity hair (cuticle scales lay tight against the shaft). This is also a good chance to take care of the scalp too with antibacterial ingredients. A discussion of natural deep conditioners is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1m014r/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_1_oils/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1pa93e/info_about_natural_hair_mask_ingredients_pt_2/).\n\n**Drying**\n\nOne of the most common sources of hair damage is heat styling such as hot irons, straighteners, and hot blow dryers [8]. Avoid these as much as possible to avoid the damage they cause (we like natural texture here!). While heat styling may seem like the only way to make your hair look good right now, over time as the condition improves it will most likely look better without the need for heat. *However,* there's some preliminary research that indicates complete air drying also damages the cell membrane complex between cuticle and cortex fibers[5], so here's some drying suggestions to minimize as much damage as possible:\n\n- Towel/shirt drying: Soak up some excess water first by wrapping your hair in a towel for a few minutes, or better yet use a fabric with a finer weave like a cotton t-shirt or satin/silk, as the rough fabric loops on towels can cause friction damage (curlies should visit /r/curlyhair or google \"plopping\" for curl-specific ways to do this).\n\n- air drying: This is best for smoothness and shine, but consider using a protein treatment and/or penetrative deep conditioner from time to time to conserve the integrity of your cell membrane complex and avoid fragility and breakage.\n\n- blow drying: Or, blow dry your hair on a low heat setting after applying a heat protectant with non-volatile silicones, PVP/DMAPA acrylates copolymer, Quaternium 70, and/or hydrolyzed wheat protein as one of the top ingredients [2]\n \n\n**Styling**\n\nStyling regimen is a very personal preference that people tailor to their own unique hair over time, so we won't presume to advise on any specific styling technique here. A few good rules though are:\n\n- avoid products with short-chain alcohols[7]. The short-chain alcohols (SD alcohol, alcohol denat., propanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) are included in products to decrease drying time and make the product spread more easily, but they also dry out the hair by pulling out moisture. Dry hair is more susceptible to breakage, damage, and frizz. \n\n- \"Good alcohols\" on the other hand include lauryl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol. These are long-chain molecules that act like conditioners by smoothing the hair cuticle. Just be careful not to use too much, as that can make the hair feel weighed down and greasy. \n\n- Silicones have the same conditioning effect, but can be more difficult to wash out and therefor can build up over time with undesirable consequences. Read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/) post for more information about silicones. \n\n\nAgain, these are tips to help you start out and aren't definitive rules. Some people may not see as much change as they'd like, or may even see negative effects from this routine. Just remember that change in hair quality is a slow process, so be patient for a couple of weeks if you don't see immediate improvement. If after a while your hair still hasn't changed or has taken a turn for the worse, look at our [other care guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/wiki/beginner_haircare_guides) or post a question on our sub!\n\n------\n\n*cited sources:*\n\n1.

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things.

    "body": "Hwahae: It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

It looks like Laneige recently (?) released a new sleeping mask with centella asiatica extract as its main selling point. At 60mL, it's smaller than the 70mL Water Sleeping Mask. It retails for about 32,000 KRW and so far I've seen it on Gmarket and Testerkorea.

The price is also right at that point where I'm not sure if I want to give it a shot. How about you guys? Anyone here going to go for this?",

The cream is an opaque white whereas the other sleeping masks are more gel like and translucent. It’s definitely not heavy or suffocating thick cream and it’s surprisingly spreadable and not as dense or oily as expected? I haven’t tried it so I’m useless lol but I hope that was some decent product description. I can’t remember if there’s a scent so probably nothing toooo strong. I have oilier skin so I really don’t use creams until the fall/winter. But I’m excited bc I love cica stuff and yeah Liah did hype it up a bit lol",

    "body": "Take a second to look through these photos. Can you tell a difference between the two sides? Which is which? The answer will be in the comments.  \n\nHopefully I got enough pictures with different lighting. These are all different stages of my routine in the morning.\n\n\nSCENT:\n\nIt has been mentioned in this sub that the DT serum smells like pee. For me it has a clean, neutral scent. I would assume those were bad batches. \n\nIf I were to compare the two, I think Kérastase smells better. It also has a pleasant scent that lingers on my hair for a couple hours. DT does not linger, probably because it’s so neutral.\n\nSecond opinion: \nI asked my boyfriend to smell it too without context, he has a more sensitive nose than me. He stated that it doesn’t smell bad, I asked him if it reminded him of anything and he said it doesn’t. I told him that it smells like a clean scent to me and he agreed. \n\nThen I explained the rumor about it on Reddit and he said:\n“No, it doesn’t smell like urine. I am well acquainted” (referencing my dogs lol)\n\nSo do with that information what you will, maybe he’s just being agreeable 😂 but rest assured, you now have two more opinions on the scent. I would say to smell yours before applying to the hair just in case. I’ll update this post if there are any changes as I use it.\n\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nDollar Tree (from the bottle):\nWATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, GLYCERIN, PHENOXYETHANOL, POLYQUATERNIUM-37,\nPROPYLENE GLYCOL, CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, DIMETHICONE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, PEG-20 STEARATE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, FRAGRANCE, C13-16 ISOPARAFFIN, TRIDECETH-6 ACOHOL, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, DIMETHYL STEARANINE, HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, PANTHENOL\n\nKérastase (from their website):\nAqua / Water / Eau ● Dimethicone ● C13-16 Isoalkane ● Niacinamide ● Glycerin ● Polyacrylamide ● Phenoxyethanol ● C13-14 Isoalkane ● Laureth-7 ● Panthenol ● Ascorbyl Glucoside ● Butylene Glycol ● Linalool ● Hydroxycitronellal ● Benzyl Salicylate ● Benzyl Alcohol ● Hexyl Cinnamal ● Citronellol ● Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein ● Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone ● Coumarin ● Hydrolyzed Corn Protein ● Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ● Limonene ● Iris Florentina Root Extract ● Citric Acid ● Ci 19140 / Yellow 5 ● Ci 14700 / Red 4 ● Parfum / Fragrance\n\nOne notable difference in the ingredients is the addition of niacinamide in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is supposed to promote hair growth when used on the scalp. But if you are anything like me, I don’t apply serums all the way to the scalp, I start them from about the middle of my hair through the ends. \n\nBased on this, I do not believe niacinamide is especially helpful in the Kérastase. Niacinamide is probably more helpful in shampoos and scalp products (And now I’m tempted to use a certain DT niacinamide/squalane serum in my hair instead of on my face 🤣)\n\n\nPRICE:\n\nKérastase: $60/3.04 fluid oz, or $19/oz\n\nDollar Tree: $1.25/4 fluid oz, or 31¢/oz\n\n\nTEXTURE:\n\nI put these next to each other on the back of my hand. Kérastase has more of a serum feel, it’s clear/yellow upon application, and it has a little more of an oily texture. DT starts out a little thicker and looks white/creamy at first, then it blends out to be sheer. With both products, I rub them between my hands before applying to hair. \n\n\nMETHOD:\n\nLast night I did my normal shower routine, including a clarifying shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner. I’ve been using this particular duo of products for about 6 months. \n\nI let my hair dry for a couple of hours and applied one serum on each side, washing my hands between applications. Then I put my hair in braids for the night. I didn’t use any other leave-in products before taking pictures.\n\nIn the morning I took out the braids, hand-combed them, brushed through them, and then did some touch-ups to the ends with my curling iron, taking pictures throughout every step. \n\nSo let me know what you think and I’ll put my final thoughts in the comments!

Both sides of my hair look shiny and hydrated. The ends feel great. They are equally manageable. The dollar tree side MIGHT have a little more shine to it, or it could be the angle of my camera.\n\nI seriously can’t tell a difference besides the fragrance (I had to keep smelling each side to make sure I had them right) and the fragrance is not worth $58.25 to me. So you know where I’ll be spending my money.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

I had to test the products adequately before making my mind about them. Other than the products in the picture, I purchased the Milk Protein Shampoo Bar as well. Overall I am very angry at myself for trying these products out.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **0.5% FERULIC ACID, 15% VITAMIN C, 1% VITAMIN E MULTIVITAMIN AGE DEFENSE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, L-Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C, Alpha Tocopherol Vitamin E, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, D Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate)\n\n***My experience:***  This is the product I was the most excited about. Vitamin C is a powerhouse of an antioxidant and has many proven skin benefits. L-Ascorbic Acid is the most potent and studied form of Vitamin C, notorious for being highly unstable. I have used a bunch of Vitamin C serums but it can be really hard to find a well-formulated one, especially in India. I so wanted this to work out. Unfortunately, this serum broke my blemish-free skin-so-good spell (or Copper Peptide - will explain later). My skin was perfect right before the ER haul. After trying these products my skin started to break out left right and center. So after being frustrated with my new breakouts, I decided to check the PH of this serum. To my surprise, the PH came out to be PH 6-7. Vitamin C's work best between PH 2-3.5. I contacted the brand to know what they claim for the PH to be. They informed me the PH for the product is \"PH 2.5-3.2\" on their Instagram handle. I took it up further and after a lot of back and forth. [This](https://imgur.com/a/ihKkY6T) is the reply I received from the brand owner.  The preservatives & PH stabilizers that reacted were not mentioned in the ingredients list. I asked her later why they were not mentioned? I was told that the PH stabilizers and preservatives were less than 0.5% and anything less than 0.5% was not required to be mentioned. I, personally cannot understand that L-AA (15% and highly acidic PH 1-2) could turn a PH of 6-7 with just 0.01% of Ph stabilizers (As per what she claimed).\n\n***Texture:*** Thick goopy. I could sort of see/feel the ascorbic acid particles in the serum. It was clear when it arrived but has turned slightly yellow now.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe). I will not be repurchasing unless I find out the changed and fixed the formula.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Took a picture of the vitamin C serum. It turned slightly yellow now. It was clear when it arrived.](https://preview.redd.it/a5ikili8bjg51.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd81bcb46e515122c37d2f0c79d1440712e1a2f0)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **COPPER TRIPEPTIDE + PHYTO CERAMIDE SERUM**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled Water, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phospholipids (and Sphingolipids, Copper tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.))\n\n***My experience:*** I wanted to include copper-peptides in my routine after Gothamista raved about them. I haven't been able to get my hands on the TO/Niod ones. Let's copy-paste everything about my excitement and the sadness in what really happened with Vitamin C, here, as well. Basically, PH came out to be PH 2-3. The brand claimed it to be around PH 6-7. The owner admitted something went wrong. I discontinued usage. I received this product 2-3 days earlier to the Vitamin C serum. I broke out 2 days after introducing the Vitamin C & the Bakuchiol. I thought it was vitamin C that broke me out but in afterthought, it could be this serum as well. Maybe my skin barrier was ducked because of these, maybe it was an ingredient. Who knows? Interestingly this product mentions the preservatives. Not sure if it is because they are in a % above 0.05% or the brand just decided to put these in the ingredients list on the website.\n\n***Texture:*** Watery liquid, blue in color. Did not sting after application, slightly irritated my eyelids.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** All in all, the product was unstable and breaking me out (maybe).

Bakuchiol can have anti-acne and anti-aging benefits very comparable to tretinoin as per primary studies. However, Bakuchiol is not the same as Babchi oil. A lot of brands claim to be using Babchi oil and that can actually have some side effects. This [article](https://bakuchiol.net/2019/10/14/babchi-oil-versus-bakuchiol/) explains the difference well. Thus I had contacted ER before purchasing to ensure they were using Bakuchiol and not Babchi extract. They claimed they were indeed using Bakuchiol. On the first experience, it had the typical essential oil smell. The fragrance is toooooo much and it lingers. As per the ingredients list on site, it seems like it could be the Tansy oil, which I have no clue a to why it was added. Essential oils provide no benefit other than fragrance. Since I was breaking out I thought it must be this oil at first. So I just used it once and did not use it again till I found out it could be the products mentioned above. After that, I have tried two attempts to use this product. I tried to use it at night as a face oil. The smell lingers and it can be a good thing or a bad thing(depending on your preference). It is definitely not good for the skin. I didn't experience any breakouts but it did not give me any benefits in the short period I tried to use it. The smell was just too much for me. Thus, I tried to use it as a massage oil, pre-cleansing. It worked well initially. However, I started to notice my face getting red and sensitive after a few days so I stopped. I haven't use the oil ever since. I may give it another attempt but the fragrance is a huge turn-off.\n\n***Texture:*** Lightweight, nonsticky, oily.\n\n***Another issue:*** The ingredients list [on the ](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY)[pack](https://imgur.com/a/cQdPBJY) was different than the one online. I mentioned this issue to the owner as well. She did not respond to this issue. Not sure if this was just another error or if this is the correct one actually.\n\n***Status:*** ***WNR.*** Please remove the essential oil from this product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MILK PROTEIN SHAMPOO BAR**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut Oil\\], Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, and Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium PEG-7 Olive Oil Carboxylate, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Benzyl Alcohol & Salicylic Acid & Glycerin & Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hair fall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** I purchased this after hearing a lot of hype around their shampoo bars. This did not increase my hair fall and when it arrived it looked really small but I think a little goes a long way with this one. I think it felt it was really gentle but not suitable for my hair type. It made my hair frizzier and slick at the same time although my scalp and hair both felt clean.\n\n***Status:*** May try another bar better suited for my hair type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **MOIST REPAIR HAIR CONDITIONER**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Distilled water, Glycerine and Water and Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Organic Glycerine, Quaternium-91, and Cetrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Water & Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract & Saccharum Officinarum \\[Sugar Cane\\] Extract & Citrus Aurantium Dulcis \\[Orange\\] Fruit Extract & Citrus Limon \\[Lemon\\] Fruit Extract & Acer Saccharum \\[Sugar Maple\\] Extract, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Benzyl Alcohol, and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My Hair type:*** Low porosity 1c-2a, scalp prone to dermatitis, was experiencing heavy hormonal hairfall during that period.\n\n***My experience:*** On the website, they claim that this can be used on the roots as well. I tried that a few times.  It felt like it left a film on my hair and my hair looked greasy like that, thus I just started applying this on my ends. It does help detangle hair in the shower and it makes hair softer. However once dry, my hair becomes frizzier and tangled after wash. Again, I feel it may not be suited for my hair type. I think people which thick hair might like this.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **DEEP CONDITIONER HAIR BUTTER WITH HIBISCUS, SHIKKAKAI & ARNICA EXTRACT**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\], Theobroma Cacao \\[Cocoa Seed Butter\\], Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Ricinus communist \\[Castor\\] Seed Oil, Cocos Nucifera \\[Coconut\\] Oil, Aloe vera Juice, Arnica Montana \\[Arnica flower\\]extract, Water, Glycerin, Persea Gratissima \\[Avocado\\] Fruit Extract, Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Tamarindus Indica Fruit Extract, Hibiscus Rosa-Senensis Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis \\[Rosemary\\] leaf extract, Tocopheryl Acetate \\[Vitamin E\\], Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Leaf Extract, Water \\[aqua\\].Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol and Salicylic Acid and Glycerin and Sorbic Acid.)\n\n***My experience:*** The website claims that this can be used as a leave-in cream as well but I just used it as a hair mask and washed after 1-2 hrs. It left my hair extremely nourished and soft but really greasy. Even after washing it with a sulfate shampoo by hair were pretty much weighed down. I think this would be good for those with thick hair. I liked it for extra nourishment. I will use this up. I didn't notice my hair falling excessively while using this. The quantity is really little though and I am not sure how many uses you can get if you have very thick voluminous hair.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ORGANIC LIP** **~~SCRUB~~** **STICK**\n\n***^(Ingredients as on Website:)*** ^(Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Organic Cocos nucifera (Coconut Oil, Ricinus communis (Castor Seed Oil, Beeswax \\[Cera Alba\\], Hydrogenated Olive Oil and Olea Europaea \\[Olive\\] Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii \\[Shea Butter\\] and Organic Brown Sugar)\n\n***My experience:*** This product was a complete dud. Maybe I received a lip balm instead of a scrub. Maybe the sugar particles melted. Maybe my product did not have any sugar particles. I rubbed half the product to ensure that they were not buried deep inside. This was just a hard thick balm, not moisturizing at all. It has no scrub particles. This was a major disappointment. I had to contact ER for several days to get this fixed. I have no clue what went wrong with this product.\n\n***Status: WNR***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***OVERALL BRAND REVIEW:***\n\nI appreciate how candid the owner was in admitting what could have gone wrong. Her responses seemed genuine. After much discussion about the unstable formulation, I had to wait a long while before the refund was processed for the defective items. I left reminder emails for the refund which was just very embarrassing. The owner, however, provided me a complete refund for all my purchases which is kind & generous.\n\n***I hate that they did not announce the issues in their batches on their Instagram/website. A batch can have anywhere around 500-20,000 units(approx). If the whole batch was bad, I feel those customers deserve a refund/new product.***\n\nI think the brand is still in the learning stage. I think their hair products may be nice. I can see them working out for some people. The skin care products were a major no-no.  I had a lot of expectations from the brand as they position themselves to be aware and first movers in the Indian skincare industry. I was gravely disappointed to know that the formulas are not well researched and; even though the brand is big on disclosure, they are not purposely going out of their way to list the complete ingredients list. No dyes, colors, preservatives, and ph stabilizers below 0.5% will be mentioned. Their sunscreen has no PA/PPD ratings.\n\nTheir packaging for both the lip scrub and the glass dropper bottle sucks. The bamboo exterior in the packaging is lined with a plastic interior. It makes the caps and sticks bulkier and thus hard to open and close. The brand heavily advertises and markets itself to be a clean/green brand. The bamboo cap packaging just looks like a gimmick though. It serves no real purpose. I appreciate the glass containers and the aluminum pump bottles although. They feel lux. Also, all products are packaged with a lot of newspaper stuffing, which I prefer over bubble wraps. Points for that.\n\nBy their brand marketing, they are trying to cater to both scientific and natural skincare consumers. The owner in a later email claimed that they aren't running the brand for-profit and are very motivated to reinvent the skincare industry. I can see that they are motivated but I cannot see how the brand is not focused on profits. Their products aren't cheap and they have invested heavily in marketing and influencer codes. I can see ER becoming the next JC. I am just sad that my experience was not nice. I hope the brand does try to take feedback and focuses more on quality and formulation. I think the brand has a lot of potential. They have a good marketing team and are developing products that are needed in the Indian market today. All their products look very interesting. I wish they ace their formulations as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: **The brand owner contacted me that they have been getting a lot of hate since my post. I want to shout it out that it's ok to voice your criticism but any kind of bullying is NOT ok. Everyone is welcome to make purchase decisions based on what they seem fit but all our personal thoughts do not need to be aired.** **We are all human.** **Please don't send any hate to the owner. This does not mean I want to stop you from sharing your views/experiences. Just be careful of your words.**\n\n**She also let me know the steps and changes they have made following the event.** [Here](https://imgur.com/X5vr0sn) **is a screenshot of our conversation.**\n\n&#x200B;",

It seems like most of them aren’t even hiring proper chemists and cosmetic formulators but rather reading up on what’s popular abroad and DIYing in their kitchen because they believe the Indian consumer isn’t educated enough to check PH. so thanks for doing that. Also if one batches PH went wrong I hope they weren’t being cheap and informed the other people who purchased from that batch and refunded them. Or else they’re literally endangering those customers skin",

And the bottle of sunscreen was swapped with a bottle of deep ceramide moisturser .\n\nThey even went on saying that they haven't got any single negative review about copper tripeptide and phyto fuse moisturser and i hence I should continue using those two.\nI agreed...as I trusted them...( Another mistake)\n\nAll this communication started on July 28th.2020\n\nFew days back this post on reddit went viral where the owner admitted to the fact that their copper tripeptide serum was unstable . And they will recall the product. The person who wrote that post got refunded in full...\n\nSo now alarmed ...I again sent them emails...but never got any response.\nFinally I sent them DM s on instagram...\n\nWhere after much contemplation they agreed to refund me only for the copper tripeptide serum and not other two products. \n\nBut they still refused to refund me for sunscreen and phyto fuse moisturser stating some internal policies.\n\nI even asked them to arrange for a pick up of all their products from my place and refund me in full...but the owner cut me short amd asked me bluntly if they could go ahead with the refund of only copper tripeptide serum or not. I agreed for the partial refund fearing even that might get stuck.\n\nI am sad,angry , frustrated and feeling a little agitatedand cheated ..\n\n\nDone with the brand EARTH RHYTHM for ever....\nAnd yes I lost 1100 bucks of my hard earned money in the pursuit..\n\nI might be labelled as a hater or someone trying to bring down the brand.trust me I never wanted to do this on a public platform .\nI sent them dms and emails...but the double standards of that brand left me with no choice..they sold me faulty products very well knowing their own shortcomings and then deny me full refund to which I m entitled for as a customer.",

    "body": "Review Day 1/7\nI recently purchased most of the new acne line by Pyunkang yul and I'm pleasantly surprised.\nUnlike the minimal ingredients the other lines have has these products contain a whole list of beneficial ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Licorice Root extract, Niacinamide, a peptide complex as well as many more. The star ingredients for this line is white willow Extract and Forsythia fruit extract. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Toner:\nIt's very watery so great for those with oily skin. It absorbs pretty quickly and has a sweet scent despite it not having any essential oils. After two weeks of using it I prefer the essence toner to it but it did help with the breakout I had and helped with clearing out my pores but it's not hydrating enough for me to see using in the long term. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Facial Cleanser:\nMade with almost the exact same stuff but includes Citric acid and other agents for cleansing the skin. I'm not going to lie I love the cleanser it's so gentle and uses micro bubble technology. You might be disappointed that it doesn't lather well but I don't really care abut that aspect. It's a thicker consistency than their ato cleanser and 500ml cleanser but thinner than the foaming cleanser and has a pH of 5.5-6. My friend tested the pH on her one and she got a pH of almost 5.8. It also doesn't strip me of any moisture i feel more hydrated after cleansing. I'll definitely repurchase when I run out i prefer it over the Cosrx salicylic acid cleanser or my cereve hydrating cleanser. \n\nPyunkang Yul ACNE Spot Cream:\nI got this for my sister but tried some myself I didn't really notice any difference on my skin but my sister who has sensitive acne prone skin saw improvements on her acne. I prefer to my a'pieu pimple patches over it. \n\nThis line is perfect for acne prone sensitive skin while people like me that has combo- dry skin might not like it as much it. \n\nEdit (I think their listed on cosdna if you want to check what is what) : Ingredients for the cleanser\nWater Cocamidopropyl Betaine Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate PEG-75 Acrylates Copolymer Glycerin Disodium cocoamphodipropionate PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Sodium Chloride Copper Tripeptide-1 Allantoin Citric acid Potassium Hydroxide Sodium Benzoate Phenoxyethanol Disodium EDTA\n\nIngredients for the toner:\nWater Butylene Glycol Dimethyl Sulfone Pyridoxine HCl Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Niacinamide Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Glycerin Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\nSpot cream ingredients \n\nWater Pentylene Glycol Glycerin Behenyl Alcohol Cetearyl Alcohol Niacinamide Glyceryl Stearate Dimethyl Sulfone Silica Polyacrylate-13 Polyisobutene Polysorbate 20 Allantoin Madecassoside Asiaticoside Panthenol Pyridoxine HCl Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract Xanthan Gum Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer Forsythia Suspensa Fruit Extract Butylene Glycol Centella Asiatica Extract Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract Glycyrrhiza Uralensis (Licorice) Root Extract Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract Copper Tripeptide-1 Hydroxyacetophenone Myrtus Communis Extract Tropaeolum majus Extract Ethylhexylglycerin Disodium EDTA\n\n*For the cleanser and toner everything has an EWG rating lower than 3 these are all available in sale on style korean for $10 USD and under (shipping was dreadful to Canada its probably good if you live in the US) \n\nEdit x2? I just saw it on yesstyle too and they are doing a sale on the products as well . To clarify i broke out by using the moisture cream from this brand I added those products plus olivarrier products to sooth my skin. I'm planning on reviewing that brand later this week \n",

    "body": "This was my first time using a non-Western sunscreen and I don't think I can come back to that ever again. I already tried a Purito product that worked well for me so I was pretty excited about their new unscented version of the sunscreen. The consitency of the sunscreen is very similar (if not the same) as a light moisturizer. It applied very nicely and was pretty hydrating. I didn't seem to experience any pilling when applied over my other skincare products, so if you do apply makeup over this sunscreen you'd probably be safe. After applying, it left no whitecast (I have a lighter skintone with yellow undertones) or any greasy residue on my face. Most sunscreens I wear leave a gross sunscreen smell on my skin, but as advertised this one left no scent. It also doesn't contain any essential oils like its counterpart, so anyone sensitive skin would have a safer time trying out this version. I would recommend this sunscreen and would purchase it again for myself. If anyone has a question, feel free to ask :)\n\nIngredients:\nWater,Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin,Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate,Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Acrylates Copolymer, Silica,1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide,Dibutyl Adipate,Ethylhexyl Triazone,Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol",

    "body": "Hey guys, I want to put you on to this method because it really helped me to understand what to look for/what not to look for in a skincare product. I worked at shoppers drugmart for a year as a cosmetics specialist, did all the skincare training etc... But let me tell you ... this is what allowed me to give my customers the best advice for their skin concerns, type etc...\n\n**You have to look at the ingredients, they don't lie!!** We've all seen it before, brands love to promise their products are great for sensitive skin, super moisturizing, blah blah and then you take home your new moisturizer and it does none of the things you were promised, or even worse, causes a reaction. **Don't fall for the marketing**, I've seen it so many times where a customer has a specific concern and looks for the first product with bold letters saying \"anti-aging\" or \"brightening...\" I've come to learn that skincare brands are very sneaky in their wording. \n\n**Ingredient lists always list the ingredients in descending concentration**, so take a look at the first few ingredients - are they fillers? are they alcohols? or are they the good stuff? Sometimes companies will advertise a specific ingredient in their product: \"90% pure vitamin c,\" which sounds amazing, but if you look at the ingredients you may find it is one of the last ingredients on the list, meaning that there is barely any vitamin c in the product - the 90% is misleading because it describes the purity of the vitamin c which is great but if there's only tiny amount, you're not gonna be seeing much results. **Cheap skincare brands often have a bunch of fillers and very little active ingredients - thus they can advertise great ingredients in their product, but really they are just selling filler ingredients that wont do anything.** \n\n**I also like to research what ingredients work best for my skincare concerns - then I chose my products based off of my findings.** \n\nWhen I was first becoming familiar with skincare ingredients I had no idea what cetearyl alcohol, glycerin and all those other ingredients were. **I stumbled upon a great tool - there are websites that do all the ingredient reading and analysing for you.** I use [https://incidecoder.com/decode-inci](https://incidecoder.com/decode-inci) \\- you copy and paste the ingredients and the website will give you a short summary with ratings for each one, and if you're curious it also provides explanations on what each of the ingredients are, and why its been given that rating - good, superstar, icky etc...\n\nI started to recognize specific ingredients at work and eventually, **I didn't even have to know the product/brand in order to determine if a product actually works and is right for my customer.** For example, if a customer has dry sensitive skin - I immediately knew to avoid products with denatured alcohol - a drying, barrier damazing ingredient common to many skincare products.\n\nI find skincare can be confusing if you're not familiar with the ingredients. Rather than looking at a bunch of reviews, putting your trust in a stranger's word, or hoping that a brand isn't trying to sell you a bad product - I encourage you to either educate yourself on what is going onto your skin, or if you don't have the time - use a website like me! There are a few others out there, Paulas Choice has one too. \n\nHope this is helpful and if you've got any questions Im happy to help :)",

    "body": "**I hate buying sunscreen.** Outside of a few gel-like sunscreens which I can never find for a reasonable cost, most just disappoint me. I feel like I often have to choose between having the complexion of a sad day, or looking **so** greasy.\n\nMy skin ranges from light-medium to medium-dark. To visualize: I'm Doja Cat when it's cold out and Kerry Washington once I can get some sun - strong golden tones. I tan fast, with or without SPF (though I am very pro-SPF), and have burned exactly once in my entire lifetime. I'm still not interested in putting myself at risk for skin cancer.\n\nI'm not going to claim that this sunscreen will not leave a white cast on people with deeper and darker skin-tones than my own, though I truly hope it works for you. So... here's my review!\n\n**Banana Boat: Light as Air, 50+ SPF UVA/UVB Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Lotion**\n\n* **Price**: $5.99 on sale at Kroger, regularly $10.99 here.\n* **Size**: 6 oz. ($0.99/oz. on sale, regularly $1.83/oz.)\n* **Scented**? Yes, it's pretty noticeable at first but fades (not completely). I'm VERY sensitive to scents (I can't wear perfumes, they trigger migraines), but it's not the usual *Eau de Banana Boat* I expected.\n* **White cast?** None on my skin tone. Absolutely none. It's decently liquid-y for the SPF, and if you apply it more liberally, it can be rubbed in and absorbs fairly quickly.\n* **Greasy**? NOPE. It's not one of those slick sunscreens. Alcohol is the fifth sunscreen, and I'm no scientist, but I suspect this may contribute to it.\n* **Pilling**? None. I tried applying more and more to dare it to pill, it didn't! Usually, sunscreen will build up and 'highlight' my hair follicles/stubble (I have hairy arms and can't be bothered to shave regularly) - didn't happen!\n* **Ingredients**: Water, Diisopropyl Adipate, Silica, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Tapioca Starch, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkyl Methacrylate Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Coco-Glucoside, Chlorphenesin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice.\n\nI read a lot of reviews on here and think \"Yeah, can't relate!\" since a lot of sunscreens with 50+ SPF have white casts, and many AB sunscreens are either intentionally white cast-y or, worse, pink-tinted, which are both a no for me. \n\nI hope this block of text helps another medium-skinned beaut who has been walking around intermittently looking like a tombstone and/or bacon grease. Feel free to ask any questions, I haven't seen much about this sunscreen before, and I've been trying it out for a while now :).",

I myself am white but obviously not enough because the white cast looks horrible, especially if I haven't shaved. And the tinted sunscreens are great, but then their too dark and it can make for some uncomfortable looks out in public. Plus, they cost more per ounce and require more care in application. But then most chemical sunscreens aren't as safe for sensitive, acne prone skin like myself. Several of the supposedly sensitive ones I saw today at Target still had oxybenzone and other irritating ingredients. But this one didn't. So yeah-thanks for the heads up. I'm hopeful about it now!",

    "body": "As the title suggests, this is my current sunscreen collection, and I'll be reviewing the products and mentioning the ones I love and the ones I don't ! (This post might be half cooked, not very organised and all over the place, but it's my first time, so bear with me :P) \n\nSo as I mentioned, this is my first post here (eeep! :D) and initially I thought of sharing my entire shelfie, but I realised that being the junkie/hoarder I am, it'd end up being a terribly long post , hence after much deliberation I decided to post different categories of products separately  (sunscreens, moisturisers, serums etc) and after I'm done with that, I shall be making a post with only the products I use in my  current skincare routine!\n\nWithout further adieu let's get started! Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere. Ingredients are highlighted to point out the position of salicylic acid, as well as presence of drying alcohols and parfum for those irritated by them. \n\nAdditional suggestions, opinions and reviews are very welcome!\n\n* PRODUCT: Boots Skin Clear Deep Blackhead Cleansing Lotion\n\nPRICE: £2.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), **Alcohol denat.**, **Salicylic acid**, PPG-1-PEG-9 lauryl glycol ether, Butylene glycol, Potassium hydroxide, Ammonium glycyrrhizate, **Parfum (Fragrance)**, Dipropylene glycol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Deep Cleansing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.29 for 65 exfoliating pads\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat., Salicylic Acid,** Isoceteth-20, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Hydroxide, Triethanolamine, Allantoin, **Parfum**, **Menthol**, Benzyl Salicylate, Disodium EDTA, Limonene, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Pads\n\nPRICE: 5.39 for 65 pads\n\nINGREDIENTS:Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, **Salicylic Acid**, Hydrogen Peroxide, **Parfum**, Sodium Hydroxide, Dextrin, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT: Clearasil Daily Clear Superfruits Refreshing Pads\n\nPRICE: £4.07\n\nINGREDIENTS: Aqua, **Alcohol Denat.**, Isoceteth-20, Glycerin, **Salicylic Acid**, **Parfum**, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Limonene, Citronellol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Hexyl Cinnamal, Rubus Idaeus Juice, Trideceth-9, Vaccinium Macrocarpon Fruit Juice, Geraniol, Bisabolol\n\n\n\n* PRODUCT:Garnier Pure Active line (various)\n\nPRICE: from £4.99 to £7.99\n\nINGREDIENTS: I can't find an ingredients list anywhere, which is frustrating but as a guide, I remember putting all the Garnier products down because they contain \"Alcohol Denat.\" The packaging lists 2% salicylic acid.

While I could see the improvements, it would feel like my skin was burning. I'm not sure if it's due to the age of the bottle, or just the ingredients, but I discontinued use.\n\nThen I bought *Boots Skin Clear Deep Cleansing Lotion* which is exactly the same as the Blackhead version just with an extra word on the front. It feels just like[ L'Occitaine's Shea Butter Toner](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8adf20777.html) that's alcohol free, but a month in and I don't really feel like it's doing anything.\n\nI used to use Neutrogena a lot and I really liked their grapefruit range, but the *Neutrogena VISIBLY CLEAR Pink Grapefruit Oil-Free Moisturiser* stopped being effective far too quickly. It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily. I felt it was super hit and miss.\n\nWith the Neutrogena Visibly Clear Spot Stress Control Hydrating Spot Treatment, is that just on acne, do you put it on under moisturiser or as a moisturiser?",

My ride or die cica cream that I always need to have in stock. I ran out in March and was gonna buy more on my Japan trip, but couldnt find it in Japan. I didnt really wanna deal with the shipping and tariffs mess with online retailers so I intended to buy it whenever theres a sale at my local Amorepacific/Aritaum store. Regular price is $34, I was hoping to snag it on a 30% sale for \\~ $25, but TJ Maxx selling it for $20 is fantastic. Even Stylevana only has it on sale for $24 right now. I was devastated that this TJ only has 1 in stock. \n\nMini review: Nothing soothes my skin the way this cica cream does it, especially on hotter days.

Reviewing FormulaRX Barrier Relief Moisturiser\n \n* Texture and consistency:  It sinks right in the skin and has a gel like texture. It doesn’t feel heavy nor makes me sweat on application unlike other moisturisers make me do. I loved the fact it’s so lightweight and has the gel consistency.\n\n* Effect/ Result: to be very honest, when I first started using this moisturiser, I felt like it was breaking me out, at one point I even stopped using the moisturiser for a while because I was just upset. I loved the texture so much but had been doubting if it’s breaking me out. But later I realised it wasn’t the moisturiser, it was just my usual hormonal acne. I’ve been using it for 2 months and lately it has been working just fine. \n\n• It has 4% niacinamide, confirmed with brand. I had thought of using it as an alternative to a niacinamide serum, but didn’t show any added visible effects.\n\n* Would not repurchase because: \n1. The price, 699 for a 50 g basic moisturiser?!?!\n2. It does it’s job, moisturises my face. Nothing exceptional about it and honestly the Minimalist moisturiser does the same thing for a lesser price.\n3. It makes my face extremely oily and greasy in an hour. My face looks extremely dull. I wouldn’t use it in day time.\n\n•PROS.\nThe thing I love the most about this moisturiser is its consistency and lightweight feature but then the fact it makes my face oily AF is a bummer :(\n\nCute packaging: I’m a sucker for pastel colours and aesthetics and gohd I love the tube in my skincare cabinet, looks so pretty ✨\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS \nLike I’ve been mentioning again and again, I really wanted to love this moisturiser but the price point and lack of any exceptional feature wouldn’t make me purchase it again. \n\nMinimalist Sepicalm 3% + Oat Moisturizer\n\nReview Type: RAVE\n\nPrice: Rs. 345-349 for 50 g\n\nUsage Time: 4 Months, every night and sometimes day too\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n* It has a creamy texture and is quite a thick moisturiser for an extremely oily skin person like me.\n\n* It does not have any actives and I can layer it on top on any active I use, is the fact I love this moisturiser.\n\n* It is decently priced, would definitely repurchase it. \n\n* I’ve used it under makeup and it has worked wonders since the makeup didn’t cause any breakout or any dryness or flakiness.\n\n* I’ve been using it since July, taking a pea sized amount every-night and still have almost 3/5 left, a little goes a long way for me which makes it super affordable. \n\n* I think it’s safe for me to call it my HG moisturiser. It has never broken me out or caused any CCs or any another issue.\n* Literally soothed me, I had been using pulp vit C earlier which was quite strong and potent, Sepicalm moisturiser came handy every time\n\nCONS\n* it’s thick and greasy\n\n* Does not sink in skin immediately unlike the FormulaRX one. It sits on skin for a while\n\n* Makes me sweat after application \n\n* Cannot use it in day (except under makeup)\n\nWhy do I still use it\n- No matter what texture it has, it has soothed my acne, vit C burn, and improved overall skin texture.\n\n- I love the price point \n\n- I use it at night so I don’t worry about how I look, all I care is how well it works. And it does work for me!\n\nI know we’ve missed detailed reviews on this sub here so here’s one from me, more coming in!\nHope y’all find it helpful :)",

This usually comes in very expensive creams.\n\nMinimalist on the other hand is the basic moisturiser\n\nIt’s a difference in needs and wants regarding which one would be preferred by a user.",

    "body": "I've lurked and occasionally posted on this sub for about a year, and I credit my clear and glowing skin today entirely to the AB suggestions I've seen here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat was my skin like before? I'm 39 and have had tenaciously stubborn acne (cysts, CCs, blackheads, SFs) since my mid-20s, especially around my chin and nose. Nothing would touch it. I've done two rounds of Accutane (cleared it for about a year each time), and used almost every prescription cream (Retin-A, Epiduo, Duac, Tazorac, etc), BP, BHAs and AHAs. I tried several different birth control pills, I drank the spearmint tea, I did everything, and while some things (BHA stopped the cystic acne in particular, but I purged for two months straight) helped a fair bit, nothing really stopped the acne from showing up every single day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo what worked for me? I saw a post about using spreadsheets to track your inventory and started using [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18GtmaRo0ycwecU4uo6ypfripAZwGHHqrIS0JBB006wE/edit#gid=0)\n linked by u/831106. I'm not sure who created it -- THANK YOU u/831106 for posting it!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnything that touched my face went on the spreadsheet. I brought my routine down to a minimum using products I was reasonably confident didn't make my skin any worse. And then I tracked everything. I watched my skin. I alternated products, testing each one for two weeks, one on each side of my face, and wrote down what happened. In the end, what helped the most was testing two products of the same kind at a time, i.e two toners at a time, one on each side of my face. I had a lot of products available to test because my best friend has a cosmeceutical skin clinic and she gives me tons of gifts! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSix months after starting the spreadsheet, I finally identified the ingredients that were breaking me out. For me (YMMV), it was fatty alcohols, mostly cetearyl alcohol. It was an epiphany to realise this, and also a bit of luck. Without knowing it, I'd settled on a night cream and a day moisturiser that happened to be fatty alcohol free, and I'd done a month of testing toners, so I hadn't tested any other creams in that time. And my skin was clear. I then started testing the Joseon cream and another moisturiser and suddenly my face was full of acne again. I stopped the creams, and within three days my skin was clear again. I also realised that almost every cream/moisturiser has fatty alcohols in them. Thankfully AB has more fatty alcohol-free options because it emphasises light layers more than creams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo now I'm almost two months off the fatty alcohols and I haven't had a single cyst, CC, or blackhead since stopping them. I use BHA and AHA every other day, but I plan to start decreasing the frequency BECAUSE I HAVE NO ACNE anymore!! I use Tazorac and Finecea 3x week for anti-aging and to help fade my PIH. My skin is now normal and balanced and so clear and glowy. And it's all because of the information I learned in this sub. Thanks AB! I hope this will give others encouragement to take the time to really drill down into what is causing acne for you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** I tracked all ingredients using a spreadsheet and finally figured out my persistent, 15 year acne struggle was entirely because of fatty alcohols (cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol). My skin is now completely acne free, totally balanced, smooth and glowy. Thank you AB!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy current routine (a combination of AB and western products; moving more to AB as I use up my stash):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Morning**    \n- *Cleanse:* Bioderma Micellar water    \n- *Actives:* Timeless Vitamin C +E with Ferulic Acid; Stridex BHA; PC AHA (BHA alternated with AHA every second day)    \n- *First Essence:* Missha First Treatment Essence    \n- *Hydrating Toner:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide toner    \n- *Serum:* Timeless B5 Hydration Serum    \n- *Moisturizer:* Clinique DDM Gel (fatty alcohol free)    \n- *Sunscreen:* Biore Watery Essence OR Rationale B3-T Superfluid    \n**The Rationale sunscreen is a new type of sunscreen developed by an Australian cosmeceutical company. It is completely different to normal sunscreens (it's an oily serum, not a cream) and is unlike anything I've ever tried. I burn easily, and it has completely protected my face at the height of an Australian summer. I can do a review of it if anyone is interested, even though it's not AB. Best sunscreen I've ever used.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Night**    \n- *First Cleanse:* Clinique TTDO Balm    \n- *Second Cleanse:* CosRx Low pH Cleanser; Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleansing Foam    \n- *Actives:* Tazorac mixed with Finecea (azelaic acid) 3x/week    \n- *First Essence:* Missha First Treatment Essence; currently testing Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum    \n- *Hydrating Toner:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide Toner    \n- *Essence:* Olay Miracle Boost Pre-Essence (niacinamide)    \n- *Serum:* Elizabeth Arden Superstart (ceramides, probiotics); currently testing Sulwhasoo Capsulized Ginseng Fortifying Serum    \n- *Moisturizer:* Rosette ceramide gel is on its way to me    \n- *Heavier moisturizer:* The Face Shop Rice Ceramide cream (this has cetearyl olivate in it, which I seem to be ok with)    \n- *Sleeping pack:* Laneige Sleeping Mask    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow I hope all that formatting works properly!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: This is my first proper post, so I hope it's helpful and relevant to the community. I'm just so grateful for all the information I've learned here.",

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/​Vinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This is an anti-dandruff shampoo and the best I've used so far.\n\nOther than the usual supermarket brands I've used Bioderma Node Ds (Excellent but pricey. Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember. I used up the entire bottle. I think 9ish months?? or more.\n\nConsistency: Normal shampoo consistency, HEAVILY fragranced. It's marketed towards Men, I think, so it smells of Men's aftershave.\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only. I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Like hair type: porosity, coil vs. S-wave, fine vs. course. There are so many things you have to figure out and remember, so it would be helpful to have a place to save it all. \nIt would be really cool if the app let you set up your personal hair profile, add preferences for ingredients, and scan barcodes. I think that would really set it apart from other apps and websites. If you don't already have a name, it could be My Curly Journey or something. \nI would be interested in helping test it when you get to that point! I hope you're planning to put it on the Google play store 😄",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** dry, sensitive, easily dehydrated; not acne-prone\n\n**Climate:** Dry, Northern California weather\n\n**Ingredients that I found out I’m allergic/sensitive to:** lanolin, nickel, triethanolamine, methylisothiazolinone, chemical sunscreen, macadamia nut oil, and snail ☹ (I can’t believe how sensitive my skin is, considering I don’t even have pollen/food allergies that I know of).\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI ventured into AB last year due to my very dry and dehydrated face. I’ve always had dry skin but when I moved from SoCal to NorCal last year, my face became more dry, itchy, and flaky especially when the weather got colder. I loved the sun in SoCal and never used sunscreen on my face (I know it’s bad). I also did not care much about my face and only used water or shower gel for cleansing after using make up remover wipes. I also did not use lotion/moisturizers.\n\nIn the past months of trying out products and reading this subreddit, I have learned so much and realized the importance of low pH cleansers, patch testing, moisturizing, etc. Despite dealing with contact dermatitis a couple times and more whiteheads or pimples than before, and having to restart my routine again and again, I am enjoying this trial and error process.\nHere are some mini-reviews of the products I’ve used so far. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Current Products:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Epielle Facial Cleansing tissues** – I have been using this make up remover wipes for years without realizing that it is made in Korea. It works well with removing most of my waterproof eyeliner before I wash my face. The one in white packaging does not contain alcohol and sodium laureth sulfate. It has cucumber extract, green tea extract, and aloe vera extract, but I think that gets washed off anyways. I use it because it is cheap ($1-$1.50) and it is easily available in Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, and online. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree The Minimum Cleansing Lotion** – This is my current first cleanser. I put it in cotton pads and soak my eyeliner with it. It easily removes the remaining eyeliner residue without making my eyes burn. It leaves an oily feel on my skin, so I use a second cleanser after this. It is great for sensitive and dry skin since it is alcohol and sulfate-free, but it has cetearyl alcohol, which some people are sensitive to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Cow Brand Gyunyu Non-Additive Cleansing Milk** – This cleansing milk is advertised as a make up remover that contains natural palm oil and olive squalene. It is alcohol-free, sulfate-free, and fragrance-free. It is non-foaming and very gentle. It feels “silky” on my skin but does not leave an oily feel. However, it does not easily remove my eyeliner (and that’s why I use make up remover wipes first). This also works as a morning/second cleanser and that’s how I prefer to use it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** – I have only been testing this cleanser for 2 weeks and so far, I haven’t noticed any problems from it. I use this as a second cleanser after Innisfree the minimum cleansing lotion. My face does not feel dry or stripped of oil after using this. It does have a strong “pine-like” smell if you are sensitive to fragrances. Is this really discontinued or not?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kikumasamune High Moist Lotion** – This watery toner smells like sake at first but that smell dissipates quickly (I actually like that sake smell). This is my first ferment product and my skin seems to like it. My skin just seems to absorb the product easily. I use 3-5 layers of this depending on how lazy I am. The ceramides in it must have helped my skin recover post contact dermatitis from Rosette ceramide gel and Cosrx snail cream. It was amazing to see my skin change from dry, red, flaky and itchy to smooth, moisturized skin. As you know, it comes in such a huge bottle so you get so much of the product for the price. The pump on the bottle sucks, so I put it on a spray bottle. I use it on my body too and my legs are no longer flaky this winter. I also just started using this on my scalp after washing my hair as suggested by some on this subreddit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap** – I actually suggested this to my boyfriend who has oily skin and hates using spatula for moisturizers. He loved it! I tried it because I did not have another moisturizer after dealing with contact dermatitis. Thankfully, it is gentle and did not cause burning on my dry, dehydrated, red skin. This and the Kikumasamune high moist lotion helped my face recover and my flaking itchy skin is gone. It is also not as light as I thought because it really keeps my skin moisturized for several hours. I’ve only been using this for 2 weeks, so I’m still keeping an eye for possible breakout from cetearyl alcohol (I haven’t used much products with it) but so far so good. Take note that it is not entirely oil-free. It has lemon peel oil and tea tree leaf oil at the end of its ingredient list (most likely in small amounts).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Acne Pimple Master Patch and Nexcare 3M Acne dressing** – These pimple patches just work so well! I love seeing how it absorbs the pus out of pimples and whiteheads. Cosrx is more expensive than Nexcare 3M but I think they are both very similar and effective.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Beauty Treats face masks** – I got these sheet masks from Daiso for $1.50 each. These masks have no alcohol, parabens, or fragrance and have minimal ingredients. These are soaked with essence, fit well on my face, and very soothing. Honestly, I think there’s not much difference between the different masks of this brand. The ingredients are mostly similar – all of them have hyaluronic acid, arbutin, cucumber extract, green tea extract, aloe vera extract and vitamin E. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**[non-AB] H&B Oils Center 100% unrefined, cold pressed rice bran oil** – I bought this to make sure that I am not going to have a bad skin reaction from rice bran oil since I want to buy the Kuramoto Bijin rice bran oil. So far, I am using this on my scalp and hair after washing my hair. This helps the ends of my hair look silky and less dry.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I will not repurchase:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n•\t**Cure Natural Aqua Gel** - My very first AB product purchase since my first visit in Japan. I wanted to see if it really removes dead skin or if it was just a gimmick. Turned out that it was just a waste of money and I finally stopped using it after realizing that it makes my skin dry and itchy afterwards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**The Face Shop Rice Water Bright Cleansing Foam** – This was my first AB cleanser without enough research. My face felt so dry and stripped after my first use and I immediately stopped it. I later found out that it is a high pH cleanser. Everyone should definitely avoid this product.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX first essence** – I bought this without knowing what a first essence really is. It is a watery essence and it feels refreshing when you pat it on your face. It did not really cause me any problems but I stopped using this because I don’t think it was really doing anything for my skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Secret Key Aloe Soothin Moist Toner** – I thought this was going to be a gentle toner since it really felt like water. It did not feel refreshing, soothing, or moisturizing. It was just like tap water. I stopped using this when I started having mild itching every time I used it. I later found out that it contained snail secretion filtrate, which my skin is allergic to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin** – I am so glad that I did not buy the full size of this toner (which is huge!). It contains so much plant extracts that I don’t even know what my skin reacted to. I only patch tested it for a week but it caused my skin to have red bumps, itching, and whiteheads. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion** – This passed my patch testing but when I used it on my full face after 1 week, my face was the most dehydrated it had ever been. I used this on damp face and layered a moisturizer on it but it gave me whiteheads, dry, flaky, and itchy skin. I’m guessing my dry skin did not like the amount of hyaluronic acid in this. I was very disappointed that it didn’t work for me since a lot of people rave about it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Skin Softener moist** – This hydrating toner was actually amazing. I found out through this product that my face loves ceramides. It made my skin smooth and bouncy, but it is pricier than other toners with ceramides, highly fragranced (like a strong perfume, which I don’t like), and I found out that denatured alcohol was 3rd on its ingredient list. If you don’t mind its price and fragrance, I think it is a good hydrating toner for dry skin.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Etude House Moistfull Collagen Emulsion** – This was the first AB moisturizer I bought because it was highly recommended by Sokoglam. It actually made my face moisturized, my face felt smooth and did not have flaking. However, something in this emulsion was causing me multiple whiteheads around my lips and on my chin (possibly hydrogenated vegetable oil, alcohol, or fragrance?). It also smelled too “perfumey” and there are so much more better AB moisturizers that I wanted to try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**O Hui Miracle Moisture Emulsion** – Something in this product caused my face to feel like it was burning and made my skin flushed whenever I used it. It also left me with dry, itchy skin on the few days I used it. Unfortunately, I cannot find its ingredients anywhere.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Mizon Water Volume EX cream** – This is a blue colored gel moisturizer instead of a “cream” consistency. It was refreshing to use and felt “cool” on my face. It did not provide me with enough hydration though. By mid-day, my face was already dry again and craving for some moisture. I gave it to my boyfriend who has oily face and he liked it as a day moisturizer. It has high alcohol content, so it is probably not good for people with dehydrated skin. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Rosette Ceramide Gel** – This gel felt sticky when I applied it on my face but absorbed after 5-10 minutes. You don’t need to apply a lot of product for your whole face and neck. It initially made my face feel smooth and nicely moisturized. After almost 2 weeks of using this, I thought I already have my HG moisturizer. Then, I noticed that my jaw got itchy. I ignored it, and then my forehead got itchy. The more times I used it, my face got increasingly itchy, but I was in denial that it was the culprit. “My face loves ceramides, so it can’t be this!” Until, I applied it once more and my face got red and itchy just a few minutes after. I developed contact dermatitis possibly from the macadamia nut oil in it. My face was red, flaky, and dehydrated and I was so devastated because this gel has so much ceramides and I love its packaging. YMMV for sure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Advanced Snail 92 All in One cream** – I was hesitant to use snail products because I was worried that I am allergic to it. Despite not knowing if I am allergic to dust mites, I just had a feeling that my skin won’t like snail but everyone raves about snail! So, I bought this and applied it on my right cheek. This is like a thick gel that has a slimy texture. A little amount goes a long way. My face absorbed the product easily too and I was really hoping that this would work for me. After one day, my nose felt very dry and I felt like I’m going to have a cold. I thought it was weird because I spent the past few days at home and was not exposed to anyone who was sick. The next day, I have full on runny nose. Four days later, I still had a runny nose (with clear drainage which is unlike a common cold where you get yellow snot – sorry if this grosses you out) and I had red bumps, redness, and itching on my right cheek after applying cosrx snail cream. I stopped using it immediately and felt relief from Benadryl cream. My “cold” also miraculously disappeared after I stopped using it. Well, looks like no more snail products for me ☹\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Shiseido Senka Aging Care UV sunscreen** - The first day I used it, at the end of the day, my face felt dry and it already gave me red bumps on my cheek, where I don’t usually get pimples. Those red bumps disappeared the next day when I stopped using the sunscreen, so they were not even pimples. This sunscreen actually felt nice to apply on my face though and dried matte, but I honestly won’t try it again.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Canmake Mermaid UV gel** – I thought I’d give an alcohol-free sunscreen a try thinking that maybe the high alcohol content in Shiseido Senka sunscreen made me dry and broke me out. This did not feel oily on skin and also dried matte. There was a very slight white cast but not that noticeable on my skin. On day 2 of patch testing it, my cheek had red bumps that did not look like pimples. These bumps also disappeared as soon as I stopped using this. So, I think I might be sensitive to chemical sunscreen. The search for a face sunscreen continues.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Products I look forward to testing:**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Hydrating Toner** – It contains 5 types of CERAMIDES! and fermented soybean! I got this from Amazon global japan and I just started patch testing it. It is watery but has a thin slimy feel to it. So far, my left cheek is feeling very smooth without flaking, even without a moisturizer on top of it. I really like its packaging too. It comes in a nice glass bottle that makes it feel more expensive than how much I paid for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Innisfree Perfect UV protection triple care cream** – This sunscreen only has physical filters. This just arrived so I haven’t tested it on my face yet. Luckily, I work night shifts and rarely go out during the day so I can avoid the sun for now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** – I have only seen good reviews on this emulsion and I just truly hope this works for me. To be honest, I really want this not only because of the sake ferments but also because of the sake bottle packaging.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Lotion** – I read that this is a better sake toner than the Kikumasamune high moist lotion, so I can’t wait to try it.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Rice Bran Oil** – 100% cold pressed rice bran oil from a Japanese brewery. I haven’t used other oils on my face but I read that rice bran oil is an occlusive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Serum** – I haven’t really tried any other serums but heard good things about this beauty serum. If it will keep my face from getting dry, then I’m all for it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**COSRX Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** – I obviously just want to try more rice beauty products right now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Matsuyama Cleansing Gel** – This is a first cleanser with minimal ingredients and contains soy extract and hydrolyzed soy protein. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n•\t**Muji seaweed shampoo and conditioner** – Well, since I love Japanese products so much, I might as well try a Japanese sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. I will have to drive 1 hour to get to the nearest Muji, but I will definitely get this. ",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

    "body": "Alright, so SkincareAddiction's Holy Grail of moisturizers doesn't work for you. You might have broken out or even developed a skin condition like me (contact dermatitis, yay!). You're desperate, you want to fix this, you are even willing to shell out more than your budget allows just to get rid of it. This post is for you. I'll walk you through the steps of figuring out what went wrong, and how to avoid making the same mistake in the future. \n\n**Why did I break out?** \n\nLet's look at the ingredients in CeraVe's moisturizing cream and run them through CosDNA:\n\n**FYI: skincare ingredients are usually listed in descending order. That is, from what ingredients they contain the most of to the least of. This is important in determining what went wrong with your skin, as it's more likely for the ingredients high on the list to be the irritant.**\n\n**Cetearyl alcohol and ceteareth-20** are fairly high up in the list, and combined they are known irritants. Despite the name they are not the type of alcohol you're most familiar with (drying), but fatty acids often derived from oils. I should mention it is uncommon to have a sensitivity to fatty alcohols, but it does happen, particularly in acne-prone skin. So make a mental note of it. Common fatty alcohols: **stearyl, cetyl and cetearyl alcohol.** \n\n**Caprylic/Capric triglycerides.** These are coconut derived ingredients that work as occlusives. They can cause clogged pores.\n\n**Dimethicone** is a silicone functioning as an occlusive. If you have broken out from silicone-based makeup primers in the past, this ingredient might be worth taking note of as well. \n\n\n**Where do I go from here?**\n\n Now that you have a general idea of some ingredients that could have irritated your skin, you can form a battle plan. First off I want to mention that you should definitely make an appointment with your derm if your skin is so uncomfortable that it is interfering with your daily routine.\n\nI don't want you to fear these ingredients. They are generally beneficial and harmless. What I want is for you to take note of the possible irritants in CeraVe, and when you use another product and have a reaction, take note of the irritants in that. Then you can start making connections. \n\n**Your ammunition:** \n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the site [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/), it is a database designed to analyze cosmetic ingredients. To use this tool, go to the [Anaylze Cosmetics page](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php), paste in the ingredients of a product and click Analysis. This should bring up the ingredient's function and their irritant and acne ratings.\n\n \n**FYI: CosDNA's comedogenic rating system is based on data from old rabbit ear studies. Treat it as a guideline and not the be all end all.**\n\n**The Plan:** \n\n\n* Put on some inspirational music. \n* Pick your website of choice with good shipping rates or whatever you look for in a cosmetics website. I chose well.ca\n* Arrange the products from lowest price to highest if the site has that feature. Write down all the products you see within your budget. \n* [This is my finished list.](http://i.imgur.com/XZLuwsC.png)\n* Analyze the ingredients.\n\n**FYI: While some products may be cheap, they might also be skimpy on the amount of product they contain. It's a little bit deceiving if you're working within a budget. It makes a lot of sense to instead sort things by the price per mL. Sometimes products that cost a bit more but also contain more product are worth the investment.**\n\n\n**Analyzing:** \n\nOkay, so one of the cheaper products on my list is Kiss My Face Moisturizer with Olive & Aloe. I found the ingredients list and put it through the CosDNA analyzer. [This does not look like something that would do well with my skin. ](http://imgur.com/a/rozIJ) \n\nLots of fragrance, lots of plant extracts, and that possible problem ingredient **cetyl alcohol** that we looked at earlier. Notable good ingredients: **allantoin, lecithin, squalane.** \n\nNext one I'll look at is [St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer.](http://i.imgur.com/0J5Ssw5.png) First of all, applying topical collagen won't be beneficial because collagen is [too large a molecule](http://www.smartskincare.com/smartchoices/myths/myth_collagen_creams.html) to penetrate the skin. Secondly, this has **fragrance, dimethicone and cetyl alcohol** which are all on our mental note list. \n\nYou get the basic idea. \n\nThe main thing I want you to take away from this post is how to do your own research. I mean, the reason I messed up my skin with CeraVe in the tub is because I didn't do my research and blindly bought something that is highly recommended on this sub. While a lot of skincare is trial and error, finding what irritates you and doesn't (and you should always patch test), hopefully this guide helps you to make more informed decisions on what you buy. I hope that when someone makes the same mistake I did and breaks out from CeraVe, they'll search the sub and find this post. \n\n**Extra:** \n[Products without fatty alcohols.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/)",

I wanted to share this with everyone and hope that someone out there finds it helpful. Love ya’ll ^~^\n\n(I found [folliculitisscout.com](https://folliculitisscout.com) to be a great database of seb derm safe products, not that only the ones with the green tick in the image are totally Sen derm safe)\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\nTreatment/Routine:\nDo NOT use any oils or fatty alcohols except squalane oil, mct oil without lauric acid and mineral oil. Only these oils and a few essential oils like tea tree oil and Rosemary oil are seb derm safe. Refer to the science behind this in Research down below.\n\nScalp:\n- Aveda rosemary mint shampoo (clarifying shampoo that also contains white vinegar)\n- Selsun suspension shampoo (selenium sulfide 2.5%)\n- No conditioner\n- Comb through squalane oil from Biossance after washing for moisture\n\nUse the clarifying shampoo and selsun only once a week. Wash with clarifying shampoo first and then use selsun. This makes selsun work better as it penetrates the scalp better without all the buildup and dirt getting in the way.\n\nUse Giovanni tea tree shampoo every 2 days and wash twice as it’s really gentle. It contains mild sulfates that don’t strip moisture out your hair. Use very little product the second time.\n\nUse 1-2 drops of squalane oil\n\nFace:\n- Simple kind to skin refreshing face wash (gentle cleanser)\n- Sebamed clear face gel (moisturiser free from oils and fatty alcohols)\n- Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ (Only the one with the green cap is safe)\n\nDon’t use these right away if your just stating out:\n- Cosrx BHA Blackhead (salicylic acid toner comparable to the Paula’s choice bha 2% but Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe so go with this)\n- The ordinary niacinamide 10% \n\nWash my face twice a day with the cleanser and then moisturise. I apply sunscreen once in the morning everyday after moisturising.\n\nTwice a week, use  Cosrx bha and wait for it to dry before applying the moisturiser.\n\nDo not use niacinamide till after one day if you use Cosrx bha as it causes irritation.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nResearch:\nWhat I’ve found is that all oils like avocado oil, argan oil, coconut oil etc. and fatty alcohols like Cetyl alcohol, Streayl alcohol, Cetearyl alcohol feed the Malassezia fungus which is the primary contributor to seb derm and dandruff. All these oils are recommended by skincare influencers for a healthy scalp and hair but don’t work those of us with seb derm.\n\nMost essential oils are also safe but I don’t recommend using anything except tea tree oil and Rosemary oil.\n\n[post pic change](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/set-of-hair-care-products-gm1012364510-272711404)\n\n[simple skincare science](https://simpleskincarescience.com/fungal-acne-malassezia-pityrosporum-routines/)\n\nYou can refer to the above link for a more detailed explanation but I’ll try my best to simplify it.\n\nSo malassezia feeds on compounds in between C-12 to C-24 carbon chain and the oils which are made from compounds outside this carbon chain are seb derm safe, they don’t feed the fungus and are the safe oils like squalane oil, mineral oil, mct oil without lauric acid. Lauric acid should be avoided as it’s formula is C-12:0 which feeds the fungus and makes seb derm worse.\n\nExample: \n[Coconut oil composition (composition and comparison paragraph)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil)\n\n[Composition (the info below)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044790/)\n\nCoconut oil is composed of the fatty acids, caprylic acid C-8:0 (8%), capric acid C-10:0 (7%), lauric acid C-12:0, (49%), myristic acid C-14:0(8%), palmitic acid C-16:0 (8%), stearic acid C-18:0 (2%), oleic acid C-18:1 (6%) and 2% of C-18:2 linoleic acid.\n\nHere all the compounds except caprylic C-8 and capric acid C-10 fall in C12 to C24 category so only these two are safe but only make up 15% of coconut oil together. Other compounds which make up the rest of the 85% fall in the C12 to C24 category so in conclusion coconut oil is unsafe.\n\nExample 2:\n[Tea tree oil (composition and characteristics)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_tree_oil)\n\nterpinen-4-ol\t35.0–48.0%\nγ-terpinene\t14–28%\nα-terpinene\t6.0–12.0%\n1,8-cineole\ttraces–10.0%\nterpinolene\t1.5–5.0%\nα-terpineol\t2.0–5.0%\nα-pinene\t1.0–4.0%\np-Cymene\t0.5–8.0%\nSabinene\ttraces–3.5%\nlimonene\t0.5–1.5%\naromadendrene\t0.2–3.0%\nledene\t0.1–3.0%\nglobulol\ttraces–1.0%\nviridiflorol\ttraces–1.0%\n\nNot a single compound is from C12 to C24 category hence it’s safe to use. Dilute this oil in squalane or mct oil before using.\n\nCheck all products for fatty alcohols and unsafe oils before buying them\n\n- - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -  - - - -\n\nFeel free to drop any questions/suggestions on how to improve this post down below. This is my first reddit post so any input is appreciated :)\n\nEdit: TLDR replaced some products which I found to be unsafe with completely seb derm safe alternatives.\n\n- Replaced Paula’s choice bha 2% with Cosrx bha as Paula’s choice is not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced old sunscreen with new seb derm free one \n- Replaced the Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo with Pyunkang Yul low ph scalp shampoo as Giovanni contained Polysorbate 20 which was not seb derm safe :(\n- Replaced the Pantene lively clean shampoo with Aveda rosemary mint shampoo as Aveda is more gentle \n- Replace The Ordinary Squalane oil with Biossance as it is completely sugarcane based, broke out a little from the ordinary and found a report that The Ordinary sometimes sources Squalane from olives due to seasonal supply chain changes so stick with only sugarcane derived squalane as the squalane olive is unsafe",

        "body": "Story time:\n\nI’ve been suffering from seb derm on my scalp majorly and a tiny bit on my eyebrows and on the face ever since 8th grade. I’ve visited countless derms and high end clinics that prescribed everything from ketoconazole (nizoral) and coal tar shampoos to clobetasol propionate creams. At one point when I was 17 (2019) this derm misdiagnosed my condition as psoriasis and this was one of the darkest phases of my life as I thought that I had this incurable autoimmune disease that only had limited research on it. It’s really hard for a teenager to accept something like this especially when he’s a skinny kid with acne and had a lot of self esteem issues, topping it off with a shitload of dandruff flakes. \n\nAlternating between ketoconazole and coal tar shampoos worked for a while as long as I used them regularly until *drumbeats* 2020. During the covid lockdown my the internet and my mom suggested coconut oil (psoriasis people used it to find relief as far as I remember idk) which made EVERYTHING a lot worse, the shampoos and creams stopped working, my flakes were huge, yellow and oily af (I know ew). I was devastated and started searching for solutions desperately, this is when I found Reddit and many other people suffering from the SAME exact condition which my dumbass though was psoriasis (man I wanted to throw hands with that derm who misdiagnosed me). I started to read and understand more about seborrheic dermatitis and stopped using coconut oil. Tried all the solutions found on various subs like ACV rinse, tea tree oil, not washing your scalp much, washing your scalp way too much, sulfate free shampoos, co-washing and a million different products. \n\nNothing worked and I kept trying until early 2022 and I started my first year o uni, this is when I reverted back to ketoconazole buttttt life’s a bitch and it didn’t work that well anymore, probably due to the deep conditioner I was using at the time. I stopped using it and the flakes exploded like really bad. This was when my friend, who I met in uni and had the same condition as me, suggested this selsun shampoo which totally changed the game. He was using it since like 3 years (once a week) and apparently it never failed him, I found a YouTube video that also said the same thing. Boy he was right that shit is straight up liquid gold and smelled so good (sarcasm duh anything that works this good has to smell bad but I ain’t complaining). I was so so so fucking HAPPY man, literally flexed my clean scalp to all my friends. But wait it’s not all happy ending, lived flake free ever after yet. \n\nThing is selsun worked flawlessly but being a dumbass I wanted to fix my dry hair so I bought various conditioners and leave-in conditioners in late 2022 and the flakes came back a tiny bit and I freaked out but selsun took them way so I kept experimenting. I found out that I had curly hair which was low porosity after researching a bit on reddit, which meant that my hair had a hard time absorbing oils and products which left me with an oily scalp and dry hair. It was recommended on a few places in the curly hair community that people with low porosity hair should wash their hair like 2-3 times a week and use a clarifying shampoo once a week or they faced build up. I was curious cuz this build up may have caused my seb derm as I didn’t wash my hair properly and never used a clarifying shampoo. Shampoos with sulfates were also seen as better for low porosity hair as they removed build up better than sulfate free shampoos and I kept using sulfate free shampoos all this time cuz after 2010s with the rise of cgm sulfates were demonised and were seen as damaging to our hair and I believed the same. I found out that sulfates are actually good and at the same time made another breakthrough where I found out that all oils and fatty alcohols contributed to seb derm as they fed the fungus malassezia so stopped using them and voila I was right, flakes completely disappeared. I also stopped using Cetaphil moisturising lotion on my face as it contained avocado oil and boom clear was clear and the redness disappeared. \n\nThat my dear patient readers was how I wrapped up 2022, ending both the year and the long battle against seb derm. I feel a lot better these days, just good vibes and clear af skin and scalp. Something that I’ve learnt over these last few years is that every single problem has a solution, it’s up to us to find it! *flexes scalp lol*",

Finding the root cause has been a bitch. \n\nKetoconazole cream (pharma grade) worked initially but pooped out after about a year, same with most other pharma and over the counter fixes. \n\nI really, really wish I didn't react to Niacinamide (exascerbates acne), I'm part of that *small* population who does - I don't know whether that reaction is more likely if you have sebderm or not but the shit is in everything, (and arguably for most - for good reason, it's pretty miraculous for many.)\n\nSo question: A lot of people with Sebderm have sparse hair growth and miniturization (sharp, short, very pointed hair that only grows partially and tends to fall out) of their hair at the temples/part/crown. Rosemary oil is known to not only inhibit sebderm but also stimulate hair growth in general as it reduces DHT. Did you have sparcity in your crown to begin with and have you noticed any difference in hair growth on the regions (either face or scalp) with which you applied the oil?",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

    "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to put out a quick review on this mask.  I hardly ever use sheet masks as most of them make me itchy (even the Klairs Supple Prep mask).  Luckily, this one did not and really hydrated my skin, which lasts through the next day.\n\nThese are pretty good!  Maybe even great, depending on your skin's needs.\n\nThey come split into two parts.  The mask material itself is cross-hatched and sturdy.  You can give it a good tug while fitting it on our face and it's no big deal.  Other than that, it feels like regular mask material (cotton).  The fit for me was good.  It was definitely big enough to cover most my (normal-sized) face with a bit to spare.  \n\nVery saturated with the juice.  It's not a creamy formula, just the usual serum style.  And get this...NO FRAGRANCE.  I know many people love the nice smelling stuff, but this one is great option for people who can't tolerate it.  Plus it has tons of ceramides.\n\nIn terms of how long until the masks drys out...well I've never made it that far.  I wore one yesterday for 40min (youtube! stop being so distracting!), pulled it off and it was still soggy.\n\n\n**Ingredients List:** Water, Butylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2-hexanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycereth-26, Propanediol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Panthenol, Betaine, Allantoin, Cellulose, Hydroxyethyl cellulose, Sodium hyaluronate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Ceramide NP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AP, Ceramide AS, Ceramide EOP, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Carbomer, Arginine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Acetate, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Glyceryl Acrylate/ Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n\nOverall, I would rate this mask positively.  It's hydrating and benign...which is what I look for in a mask.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\nGood material\n\nNo fragrance\n\nHydrating AF\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\nCost (USD 3$/mask)\n\n\nEdit: my goodness I need to learn to spell",

    "body": "I am trying to understand what is the deal with Purito and their sunscreens.\n\nThey have two different sunscreens\n\n* Centella Green Level Safe Sun \n* Centella Green Level Unscented Sun\n\nAlthough they have the same two UV filters (one UVA filter and one UVB filter), the formulation is not the same. However, the company claims the exact same SPF and UVA PF results for both sunscreens: PPD of 22.59 and SPF of 84.5 (you can see the videos below). This is very strange as even if the exact same formulation is tested twice, we will not get the EXACT same results.\n\nApart from the fact that they have used one set of results for both sunscreens, which is fairly suspicious, they have disclosed the percentage of UV filters used in their unscented formulation. According to their website: “The PURITO Centella Green Level Safe Sun contains 3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone.”\n\nThis means that they claim an SPF of 84.5 just from 2% of a single UVB filter.\n\nNow in contrast to this sunscreen, we have the Invisible fluid (formerly known as the Shaka Fluid) from La Roche Posay. This sunscreen claims to feature a special technology to “gel and stabilize the droplets containing the filters, thus forming an extremely tight and protective structure”. With this technology on board, the company still uses a good amount of UV filters, namely Octisalate (5%), Uvinul T 150 (4.5%), Tinosorb S (4%), Avobenzone (3.5%), Mexoryl XL (2%), Mexoryl SX (0.495%).\n\nAs in Europe any SPF above 60 can only be labelled SPF 50+, we can only learn more information about this product’s SPF from other countries. In Brazil, it is marketed as SPF 60 when they are able to market products with SPF 70 (https://www.laroche-posay.com.br/anthelios/hydraox-fluid-fps60). So I will assume it has an SPF of 60 - 70.\n\nSo, La Roche Posay must use a special technology and 9.5% UVB filters and 6.495% of broad spectrum filters, i.e. a total of 16% of filters blocking UVB (8 times more filters) to get a lower SPF.\n\nEven the filter used by Purito at 2%, is used by La Roche Posay at 4.5%, i.e. more than double.\n\nNow for the UVA protection, La Roche Posay claim a PPD of 46 as opposed to 22.59, but still there, they use 10% of UVA filters as opposed to 3%. So, they are using more than 3 times the amount of filters to achieve double the PPD value.\n\nIs it possible that the formulation of the Purito is so special that they can use 8 times less filters to get a higher SPF???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Safe Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dibutyl Adipate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Silica, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract (4315 ppm), Hyaluronic Acid, Tocopherol, Sorbitan Olivate, Glycery l Stearate SE, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t\\_UCgNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZy0t_UCgNk)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Centella Green Level Unscented Sun**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Glycerin, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene , Acrylates Copolymer, Silica , 1,2-Hexanediol, Niacinamide, Dibutyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Olivate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sorbitan Stearate, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Disodium EDTA, Adenosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol\n\nPPD = 22.59 and SPF = 84.5\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOQJzdQaiF4",

Of course filter concentrations don't say everything, different grades of mineral filters, coatings and inactive ingredients can influence the SPF a lot. So you can't determine the SPF solely based on filter concentrations, but going from on average 15-25% needed for SPF50+ to 3.6-5%, I mean it's at least something that jumps out and makes me curious. It's the first time I see a sunscreen with such a high filter efficiency. I hope Regardsurlescosmetiques or someone else will test the Purito Comfy and Green Level, although it's of course difficult to say how reliable these in vitro results are, maybe it will give some insight.",

Honestly, there are ways to make them work, like applying no moisturizer or less moisturizer underneath and allowing them to dry for a while before applying makeup.

        "body": "I think this is a really interesting topic, and I did a bit of digging, and here's what I think, however I preface this that I'm not a professional here.\n\nIt could be due to the way the sunscreen was manufactured(like how it was mixed), as Lab Muffin Beauty Science describes in [her video](https://youtu.be/aTNcbLHZusc?t=333), she explains that the manufacturing process is just as important as the actual UV filters used. \n\nLike the Purito suncreen, the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 also uses the same UV filters and I believe is manufactured by the same lab, and again, Lab Muffin Beauty Science explains why she thinks that product is protective enough [here](https://labmuffin.com/sunscreen-reviews-klairs-mecca/).\n\nAnother idea is that the sunscreen has a hefty amount of niacinamide which has [photoprotective properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20354654/), and since SPF is a ratio between the amount of UV required to cause a burn sunscreen protected skin and UV required to burn unprotected skin, it means that SPF doesn't measure the actual SPF absorbed or reflected from the UV filters themselves but rather whether or not your skin will burn. It also looks like La Roche Posay sunscreens do not contain the array of antioxidants that the Purito one does, because antioxidant plant extracts may [enhance the SPF value](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177626/).\n\nAn interesting note, while looking at the La Roche Posay sunscreen from the Brazilian website the Google translation says that it is water and sweat resistant, which is interesting, because in Australia, we have the same product but it does not have any water resistance claims.\n\nTaking all this together, in my opinion there might be differences in how the products are manufactured which would play a very big role in the tested SPF, but also the ingredients other than the UV filters would affect their SPF. \n\nThat would be my take on it.",

Ultra elegant, yet SPF50+, PA++++ (ok, it only means PPD >16, but still)... something doesn’t quite add up, even factoring in the amount of alcohol that goes into the some of them. If high protection EU sunscreens have taught us anything, it’s that (currently) you can’t have high protection without harming (to some extent) the elegance of a sunscreen. And in many cases a good balance has been found (eg Shaka Fluid for a lot of people), but I’m really skeptical of these ‘seemingly perfect’ sunscreens from Asia because the SPF-branding is less regulated and the results just don’t seem to align with what Europe offers.",

So if we take it that it’s SPF is indeed 60, and if the UVA is 46, wouldn’t that mean the Invisible Fluid would have a Boost Star rating above 3 since the SPF and UVAPF are much closer to one another, compared to say the P20? We don’t have a Boots Star rating for the Invisible Fluid (as far as I know), but the Ambre Solaire Fluid, which we are assuming is very close to the Invisible Fluid, only has a Boots Star rating of 3. If it did have the same protection as the Invisible Fluid (SPF60 & PPD46) shouldn’t it have a higher star rating? I don’t like the Boots system, as I think it is confusing and misleading, but it got me thinking. Also I have been using the Garnier Ambre Solaire Advanced Fluid since March and it’s great (briefly went back to Shaka/Invisible Fluid, but prefer the more matte Garnier), so I hope it has a similarly high UVA protection.",

    "body": "My foray into skincare began around July last year when I decided I wasn't happy with my skin and wanted to do something about it. Initially I researched foundations, but none of the products I tried evened my skin to my satisfaction, which is when I found /r/SkincareAddiction. Here, I learned that my skin was dehydrated, more than likely due to using Dove bar soap and BP on my face and zero moisturizer every day. :) My skin has changed so much since I started and I am finally ready to review some products I have been using and maybe help others find their way.  \n**Disclaimer** This is my first Reddit text post, I'm really hoping the formatting turns out the way I anticipated.  \n\n**Where we started:**  \n* 25/F/FL; combo/oily dehydrated skin with mild acne, some PIE, sporadic CCs and occasionally painful nodules usually on my forehead, chin, or temples. Noteworthy: I have been on oral contraceptives since I was a teenager and switched to Skyla in 2015. I don't believe my acne is hormonal, but since I've always had some sort of hormonal birth control it's hard to tell how much it has affected my skin.  \n\n\n* No real routine, just washing my face with bar soap in the (scalding hot) shower, using a Neutrogena BP mask to annihilate acne. I was under the (false) impression that since my face was oily I certainly wouldn't want to add moisturizer!  \n\n\n* Mostly concerned with the nodules I was getting because they were big and painful and took forever to heal. Admittedly, I am a skin picker and just recently I realized this is probably the cause of the nodules because the two that I have dealt with recently developed in spots that I had messed with just a few days before.  \n\n\n**Level one: Build a routine.**  \n* At this point, I read everything. EVERYTHING. I spent a couple of months just researching products, learning about skin types, and poring through threads on SCA. I put down the BP mask and bought Neutrogena foaming face wash and CeraVe PM. This was around September when Irma hit and I was without power for a few days, but still managed to keep my fledgling routine. \\o/\n\n* Unfortunately, I felt that CeraVe PM was contributing to a new outbreak of whiteheads around my mouth, where I don't normally get whiteheads. I wound up replacing it with Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow which I LOVE. More on that later.\n\n* I also incorporated Neutrogena Sheer Touch sunscreen around this time, but that gave me small breakouts as well and I just didn't like the way that it sat on my skin so I decided to put sunscreen on hold while I did more research.\n\n* While incorporating these products into my routine I tried my best to follow SCA's advice and start slow, one product at a time, and patch test first. I don't really feel that patch testing helped me determine if a product would break me out, as I wouldn't notice any difference in the area I patch tested but then within a few days of trying a new product on my whole face I would see an increase in whiteheads in strange areas. It sucked, but it's alright since the breakouts were mild and didn't take long to appear so I knew fairly quickly that a product wasn't working for me. I still recommend patch testing for sensitivity purposes.\n\n**Level 2: Sunscreen and acids.**  \n* Finally, after months of reading, I felt ready to take on an acid. I settled on CosRX BHA Blackhead Power liquid because it was purportedly more mild (and less expensive!) than other options and I felt that I should start gentle. I picked this up from Ulta in early December and used it every three days for 4 weeks. During that period I don't feel like I had a purge; I kind of expected my acne to go into overdrive but it didn't really get any worse. After the 4 weeks I started using it MWF. \n\n* I also bought Skinfood's Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel from Amazon, but shipping took about a month so I was able to incorporate it well after the BHA.\n\n**Level 3: Skincare God.**  \n* *Just kidding.* So here we are in mid April and I have repurchased the Neutrogena cleanser once (although I switched to hydrating instead of foaming), Peach Slices moisturizer three (!!!) times, Skinfood sunscreen once, and am 1/3 of the way through the CosRX BHA. Let me tell you, I am SO much happier with my skin. \n\n* My skin is more bright and even and I have had much fewer blemishes than I used to, which I would attribute equally to a marked decrease in picking. Taking better care of my skin and working towards a goal makes it easier to keep myself from messing up my progress, although I still have setbacks during times when I am very stressed out, but I try not to let that discourage me.\n\n* Oil production WAS down, but a couple of weeks ago I tried to incorporate Cosrx Ultimate Moisturizing Honey Overnight Mask at night for added hydration, but it wound up drying me out? Additionally, I am running dangerously low on Peach Slices Moisturizer and could not find it at any of my local CVS locations so I have been rationing it while I wait for more to come in the mail. :'( \n\n* From here, I want to try to find a more hydrating cream for nighttime and an easily accessible drugstore sunscreen because currently it takes the Skinfood 2-4 weeks to come in so I have to make sure I order it in advance. I also REALLY want to try Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA, but I am waiting until I get back from vacation next month before I incorporate a new exfoliant. Finally, someone talk me out of buying something from the Dr Jart Cicapair line because I'm not quite sure what it's for but I really want it.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for those still figuring out what works for their skin, as I know I felt completely overwhelmed when I first started. I am still interested in experimenting with new products but I feel that I have a really solid routine as it is so I am content to wait until I am in a better situation financially to mix things up.\n\n**Current routine**  \nAM: splash with water  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSkinfood sunscreen  \n\nPM: cleanse with Neutrogena  \nCosRX BHA MWF  \nPeach Slices moisturizer  \nSometimes a sheet mask when I'm feeling fancy (I really like Ariul Seven Days masks)  \nVaseline (not so much lately after I read a thread here about Vaseline potentially trapping bacteria if your face isn't cleansed properly)\n\n**Reviews**  \n* Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser: Not much to say here, but from what I have read that is good to say about a cleanser. It took a little time to get used to not having that tight, \"squeaky clean\" feeling that I got using the foaming cleanser, but ultimately I think this has been better for my skin. I have had my eye on Glossier's Milky Jelly cleanser for MONTHS but I can't bring myself to buy it when I am pretty satisfied with how this has been for my skin.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetearyl Glucoside, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n* Peach Slices Citrus Honey Aqua Glow: Light gel formula, sinks into my skin really well. I am still a bit oily toward the end of the day, but I have kind of resigned myself to the fact that that may not fully go away. Maybe when I start incorporating a more hydrating night cream it will help. Either way the slight oil doesn't bother me much and I really like this moisturizer.\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide NP, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol*\n\n* Skinfood Aloe Watery Sun Water Gel 50+ PA+++: Very happy with this sunscreen, although the oil control is hit or miss. Some days when I apply it after moisturizer it has a nice, almost powdery finish and I forget it's even there. Some days I'm more oily but I'm still figuring out what the cause of that might be. I don't wear foundation so I can't speak to how this sits under makeup but I do wear a little blush and I can still see it at the end of the day. When I apply it I pat it around my face and then rub it in, there is a slight white cast at first but for me it disappears very quickly, however, I am fair skinned.\n\n*Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Octyl Salicylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Peg/Ppg-10/1 Dimethicone, Lauryl Peg-9 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Titanium Dioxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Propylene Carbonate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Fragrance, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, Tocopherol*\n\n* CosRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid: I use three pumps MWF and occasionally a tiny amount to spot treat nodules. Overall I feel like it helps existing acne heal more quickly and keeps it from getting to that huge, inflammatory state. It applies and dries down very nicely and I typically wait 15-20 minutes after application to apply moisturizer. I didn't realize until recently that it has niacinamide, which I had thought didn't agree with my skin because it was also in CeraVe PM, but I think it has really helped lighten my PIE, particularly a spot on my forehead that I really went to town on last year and it was a pain in the ass to heal.\n\n*Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Water, Butylene Glycol, Betaine Salicylate, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Arginine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol*\n\n**Links that I found helpful along the way**  \n[Try a gentle hydrating cleanser -- even if you have oily skin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7j6juf/psa_try_a_gentle_hydrating_cleanser_even_if_you/)\n\n[Routines which involve inadequate cleansing, high moisture, and heavy occlusion are risky...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/86twai/psa_routines_which_involve_inadequate_cleansing/)",

(This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %. Very good moisturizer for the body.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther commercial products you can find SEPIWHITE in:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Black Opal skin care products**](https://blackopalbeauty.com/collections/skincare): They have multiple.

It's completely unfragranced but the product itself smells a little... Mouldy? I knew it smelt bad from reviews but I wasn't expecting it to really smell that unpleasant. I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade. I do use this after TO Niancinamide so hopefully the peptide brighteners work together!",

    "body": "About a month ago, I picked up the Trader Joe's Nourish Oil-Free Antioxidant Moisturizer.  Note that TJ's also sells an intensive moisturizer, which contains oil.\n\nIt's a watery lotion that is light yet moisturizing.  If I apply too much, it feels annoyingly wet on my skin for about a minute until it dries.  After that, it is perfectly comfortable.  Since it's summer here, I don't need a heavy moisturizer.  I really like this and would definitely buy it again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/6AvUUKs)\n\nPros:\n\n* Inexpensive at 6 oz for $6\n* Contains a bunch of different antioxidants\n* Lightweight\n* Fragrance-free\n\nCons:\n\n* Antioxidant concentration might be low.  Many are listed after the preservatives.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just unknown.\n* Clear container might let light in, which might make the antioxidants less effective\n* Pump might not be super sturdy?  I knocked mine off my counter and the pump came off.   I was not able to get it back on, so I had to transfer the lotion to another container.\n\n\nIngredients:  Water, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate-60, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Cetearyl Glucoside, Sodium PCA, Ethylhexyglycerin (Preservative), Shea Butter Fruit, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Xanthan Gum (Thickener), Tocopherol (Antioxidant), Sorbic Acid (preservative), Soluble Collagen, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B5), Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C Palmitate), Pomegranate Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Extract, Coffea Arobica (Coffee) Seed, Chamomile Flower/Leaf Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sorbitan Stearate, Phytonadione (Vitamin K1), Menadione (Vitamin K3), Hydrolyzed Silk, DMAE (Dimethylaminoethanol), Copper PCA, Retinol (Vitamin A), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A Palmitate), Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q10),Thioctic Acid (Alpha-lipoic acid), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), Polysorbate-20, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Phospholipids\n\nPossible dupe?  [Skin Resource MD Oil Free Antioxidant Facial Moisturizer](https://skinresourcemd.com/collections/face-moisturizers/products/oil-free-facial-antioxidant-moisturizer#goto).  The packaging and ingredients look similar enough.  The ingredients are not listed 100% the same, but it seems that it would at least be very similar.\n\nI hadn't seen a review on this moisturizer here before, so I thought I'd write one.

Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide™ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide™), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

In my local salon K18 is cheaper so that would be my preferred way to go if I was assured I wouldn't be putting my hair at any disadvantage vs. Olaplex 1 & 2.

    "body": "**Skin Type:** Combination with Oily T zone\n\n**AM Routine:** Rejuglow Face Wash<Minimalist Vitamin C<BOJ Ginseng Toner<CosIQ NMF moisturizer<Isntree Real Eye Cream<Formularx sunscreen \n\n**PM routine:** Rejuglow Face Wash<Olay Retinol Serum<BOJ Toner<Isntree Eye Cream<Pyungkal Yul Moisturizer \n\nIt's that time of the month when I'm saying goodbye to certain skincare products after trying them out. Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I’m a long-time lurker and first-time poster on this sub.\n\nI’m 29(F) and my skin type is fucked up (dry cheeks, oily T-zone, with a recent bout of hormonal acne along cheekbones and jawline).\n\nI use Epiduo that has adapalene (0.1% w/w) + benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% w/w) and Glyco-12 cream (glycolic acid 12%) in my PM routine (alternatively, with a break day in between each treatment). In the AM, I finish up my skincare routine with Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ and touch up with a sunscreen stick every two hours or so (I go over the same area 3-4 times with the stick for optimum protection).\n\nLike most people, I struggle with sunscreen reapplication because, honestly, it’s a pain in the ass. I’d rather put it on once in the morning and then forget about it for the rest of the day. However, as I’m currently battling hormonal acne and PIH brought on by PCOS and the fact that I stopped taking oral birth control pills, I’ve been subjecting my face to some pretty strong actives like adapalene and glycolic acid. And, I’ve also recently had some warts removed from around my eyes and on my neck via cauterization. Given these treatments and because I spend a lot of time outdoors, I knew I had to become more diligent with sunscreen reapplication to prevent sun-related hyperpigmentation. And since I’m lazy af and don’t like touching my face often, I turned to sunscreen sticks. Please note that I do not know much about the ingredients, but have listed them below for reference. Here is my review of the three sunscreen sticks I’ve tried so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4v40q0j04t91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57160c139b133d631630407c20ffca566e08110b\n\n**1.** **TOCOBO Cotton Soft Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1240\n\n**Experience and opinion:** I really had high hopes for this one, I saw so many good reviews online. To be fair, its not a bad sunscreen stick. It glides on the skin easily enough, and sinks into your skin to give a matte powdery finish. But, it has a strong (imo) scent. It’s a linen-y kinda scent, which I just don’t like. This scent even lingers for quite some time after application, which makes it even more annoying. Honestly, I don’t care about fragrance in skincare as long as I like the fragrance, and I just don’t like the fragrance in this sunstick.  Another con is its shape, which makes it hard to use under the eyes. Overall, if you don’t mind the fragrance, it’s a decent sunstick.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP, I can’t get over the smell.\n\n**2.** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1480\n\n**Experience and opinion:** My absolute favourite and current HG for reapplication! You can see from the picture that the writing on the packaging has faded because I’ve handled it so much. It has no fragrance, just a faint chemical scent which dissipates quickly after application. It takes a few seconds to warm up on your skin, after which it glides oh so smoothly. It has no white caste, and has a matte satin-y finish, which I LOVE. A little bit tacky to touch immediately after application, but sinks into your skin in a few minutes and becomes barely noticeable. Best part: its tear drop shape!! This makes such a difference, it makes it so easy to touch up under my eyes and around my nose.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WRP absolutely I love it so much!!\n\n**3.** **Avène SunsiStick KA SPF 50+**\n\n**Ingredients:** Octyldodecanol, Polyethylene, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Hydrogenated Microcrystalline Wax, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water (Aqua), 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Oxothiazolidine, Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Tocopheryl Glucoside.\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Box of Color for INR 743.\n\n**Experience and opinion:** This was the first ever sunscreen stick I purchased and it made me almost give up on all sunsticks. It has a chemical-y waxy kind of fragrance but my biggest qualm with this sunstick is its texture and finish. It has a Vaseline-kinda balm-y texture that just sits on top of your skin and looks like you’re slugging during the day. Needless to say it gives an oily finish, not even dewy, which looks awful on my skin type. Its extremely transferrable and gets all over your hands if you happen to touch your face. I despise it and I’m not sure how I’ll use up the product.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP never ever, god I hate it.",

    "body": "i've reached the point in the semester where i would rather procrastinate than study, so i've been spending a lot of time on reddit, especially in this subreddit! i really enjoy giving advice and researching/googling things for other people, but i've been noticing lately that i've been offering the same pieces of advice or asking for the same clarifications, so i thought i would draft a post like this. i formatted it based on similar guides i've seen in other subreddits. i hope this is an okay thing to post - if it would be better for me to message the mods about something like this, just let me know!!\n\n     \nthings to ask yourself before posting!\n-\n\n**have you utilized the subreddit resources?**  \nread through the meta post; read the FAQ, beginner's routine, and other sidebar posts and wikis; take a look at the resources linked from the sidebar posts. most simple questions regarding general skincare or routines are answered in the sidebar links.\n\n____\n\n**did you search the subreddit?**  \ndo a search for a few keywords related to your question. there is a very good chance that someone had the same question as you and asked it before!\n\n____\n\n**would your question fit into a weekly thread?**  \n**\"no stupid question\" wednesdays** - if you're embarrassed about asking a simple or basic question, post it in this judgement-free zone!  \n\n**examples:**   \n>why do i need to moisturize?  \n \n>what is sunscreen?   \n\n>can i wash my face in the shower?\n\n**troubleshooting thursdays** - for questions specifically addressing a concern with your skincare routine. if you want someone to critique your routine, or you need help building a routine, or you have a question about a specific product or part of your routine, post here.   \n\n**examples:**\n>where should i add a BHA into my routine?  \n \n>does the order of these products look correct?  \n\n>what in my routine could be causing clogging?\n\n**simple question/off-topic fridays** - if you have a quick, simple question (such as a yes-or-no question or something that can be answered conclusively in a few sentences) or a question that you don't feel merits its own thread, it goes here. also, if you have a question or comment that you want to share with the r/sca community that doesn't really have to do with skincare, you can post that here too!  \n\n**examples:**  \n>can anyone recommend a good non-minty lip balm?  \n\n>should i be concerned about the ingredients in this product?  \n\n>what is everyone's favorite pie recipe?\n\n____\n\n\n**are you asking for medical advice?**   \npeople in this subreddit cannot diagnose medical issues, suggest prescription remedies or other controlled medical treatments (including dietary advice), or act in lieu of a medical professional. it is also not in anyone's best interests to ask people in this subreddit to critique or validate the advice you receive from a doctor. an open, anecdotal discussion of treaments for various conditions or of experiences with medical professionals is appropriate, but you should not take those discussions as sources of medical advice.   \n\n**asking for medical advice (bad):**\n>what is this rash on my butt? pics included.  \n\n>should i take accutane?  \n\n>what topicals should i ask my derm for at my appointment tomorrow?\n\n**not asking for medical advice (fine):**  \n>what should i look for when choosing a derm?  \n\n>just got diagnosed with rosacea, can anyone else share their experiences with it?  \n\n>considering accutane, has anyone else taken it for body acne?\n  \n\n\n     \n\nthings to include in your post!\n-\n\n\n**your current skin situation:**  \ndescribe as best you can your overall skin type - is your skin oily or shiny? is it dry or flaky? dehydrated? do you have enlarged pores, blackheads, or sebaceous filaments? are you prone to acne, irritation, clogging, or other issues? it's best to be as specific as possible! provide any other information about your skin that affects your skincare choices or would affect recommendations, such as allergies, ingredients you know you have a bad reaction to, etc. it's good to give a little bit of history here, but the briefer you are, the more people will read through your whole post.\n\n**bad:**\n>my skin is oily but sometimes dry and also acne prone. it gets clogged or irritated by some lotions.\n\n**good:**  \n>my skin is dehydrated but starts to look oily throughout the day if i'm not wearing makeup. i break out easily, usually from stress or hormones, and i know cetyl/cetearyl alcohol leads to clogging for me. i'm also sensitive to sulfates.\n\n\n____\n\n**your current routine:**  \n list all of the products you currently use - as in, what you have regularly used over the last few weeks or so. this is usually easiest to format if you just list your am and pm routine separately, with the products in the order that you use them. remember to include makeup, and note any non-skincare products that could effect the area(s) you're concerned about (eg. toothpaste if you're dealing with irritation around the mouth, hair products for breakouts along your hairline, etc).\n\n**bad:**\n>AM: cleanse, apply cerave moisturizer, apply sunscreen.\n\n**good:**  \n>AM: cleanse with cerave hydrating, apply a thin layer of cerave in the tub, let that sink in, then apply eltaMD physical.\n\n\n____\n\n**what you need help on:**  \nwhy are you posting? what specifically do you want advice or recommendations for? this can be a specific problem you're trying to treat, a skincare goal you're trying to achieve, or an effect that you would like to see from your routine. do you want specific product recommendations? if you have tried other methods of treating your problem or achieving your goal, explain that here.\n\n**bad:** \n>i have acne on my face. \n\t\n**good:**  \n>i keep getting breakouts (like clogs and small whiteheads) in the area of my right cheekbone. i've tried spot treating with BP, but it's not helping. i haven't changed my routine recently and it's not on the side that i hold my phone on. what could be causing this? and can anyone suggest other spot treatments to try?\n\n      \n\nother things to consider\n-\n\n - if you need advice on something specific that is tangentially related to skincare, there may be another subreddit that could offer better advice. questions about shaving, for example, can be posted in /r/wicked_edge. check \"related subreddits\" in the sidebar!\n - include as many relevant details as possible, but also try to be as brief as possible. if your post is lengthy or difficult to read, you may get less of a response. if you find yourself typing over three long paragraphs or so, consider editing things down or reformatting some information into lists.\n - include pictures if you think people need to actually see the issue to help you (remember - don't ask for visual diagnoses) and the pictures are clear and high-quality. a blurry, over-cropped cell phone picture of an unidentifiable skin-colored smudge is not much more helpful than no photo at all!  \n - this is more of a general reddit tip: **if you are posting pictures of your face or other identifying information, consider using a side account.** keep accounts with identifying or sensitive info and photos of yourself separate from the accounts you use to troll /r/askreddit. there have been some issues surrounding this in larger subreddits that regularly involve people posting pictures of themselves (such as /r/makeupaddiction and /r/femalefashionadvice). as /r/skincareaddiction continues to grow, let's keep this a safe place for discussion!",

    "body": "I’ve tried many creams and hydrating serums/toners over the years, but consistently the best one at plumping and hydrating and overall being a sponge to water has not been a face or body product but a hand cream. The LRP Cicaplast hand cream absorbs water like crazy (probably because of the 30% glycerin), plumping up the skin instantly (especially if you apply it to wet skin). It’s also got 4% niacinamide, as well as shea butter and dimethicone to complete the cream (so it’s not just a humectant-style product). It works fine alone but I like to layer another cream on top overnight to really pack in that moisture in my dry climate, my favorite combo with it being Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cream.\n\nBecause it’s made for the hands, it seems to be formulated to not be too greasy or tacky as well.\n\n(I’ve heard people say similar things about using the Neutrogena Norwegian Formula hand cream on the face, which also has high percentage glycerin—I think 40%.)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\nAQUA/ WATER ∙ **GLYCERIN** ∙ BUTYLENE GLYCOL ∙ CETEARYL ALCOHOL ∙ **NIACINAMIDE** ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE ∙ **BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER / SHEA BUTTER** ∙ **DIMETHICONE** ∙ PEG / PPG-18/18 DIMETHICONE ∙ GLYCERYL STEARATE SE ∙ SODIUM POLYACRYLATE ∙ CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ∙ PHENOXYETHANOL\n\nEdit: I wouldn’t suggest using this as an AM moisturizer. It’s got quite a thick ointment texture—great for overnight moisturization, but not great for using under sunscreen and makeup and such.",

But I’m gonna do it anyway…I think out of all the sunscreens I have tried/reviewed (this will be number 16) I haven’t had one recommended and pushed in my direction more than the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun. And on paper…I 100% understand why.\n\nThis is the first K-Beauty sunscreen that I have used that doesn’t contain fragrance, essential oils, and has absolutely no white cast…all in one product. The first time I applied this sunscreen I thought “No way…absolute magic.”. The look and feel of this product really reminds me of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence. But, I find the Purito to be lighter and a bit more creamy/milky (if that makes sense LOL). The Klairs Airy UV Essence is a bit more jelly-like and thicker…although honestly the difference is very minimal.\n\nAnother quality I love about this Purito Unscented Sun is the fairly concentrated blend of Centella Asiatica. 5 different forms of “Cica” are here including Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, and Asiatic Acid. I found this blend (along with the Niacinamide also found here) to help in reducing redness/irritation from a few blemishes and the introduction of Curology/Tretinoin into my routine. \n\nAnd finally, while the scent is very similar to that of the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence…its a bit more mild/approachable. If you remember, I compared it to super glue or artificial nail glue (but not as intense). My first week using the Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun had me feeling very impressed. It seemed to be doing all the things that I loved about the Klairs Sunscreen but with a lighter feel and at a more affordable (per OZ) cost. I was totally ready to do my happy dance…until I decided to go for a walk/jog without my sun hat LOL!\n\nI posted about it in a few places (so you might already know the story LOL)…but after 57 minutes outside with my forehead exposed (just the Purito Sunscreen on) and I had a fairly noticeable tan line where my head wrap stopped just along my hair line. Honestly, to say I was shocked and a bit disappointed by this was an understatement. I’ve been working so hard to keep my skin away from UV exposure to give the Tretinoin/Hydroquinone as good of a chance to reduce my hyperpigmentation as possible. It really felt like a step back to see this kind of result. \n\nOver the course of the next week (up until today)…my skin just seems to have darkened a bit. Between the combination of being near windows, getting the mail/walking the dog, and having my mask off as I drive to and from places…the Purito Centella Green Level Sunscreen just doesn’t seem to offer as much protection as other products have. I don’t think there has been another sunscreen I have used that I can say this about. Other products may have been greasy, smelly, or white-cast inducing…but they all did the basic function of screening the sun LOL!\n\nNow, this isn’t to say that this product doesn’t have the ability to work. Korea has some strict standards and testing in place so this product is by law…SPF 50+ PA++++ if it’s allowed to be sold as such. However, there are so many other factors that can play into the efficacy of sunscreen once it’s on.\n\nMy sweaty face while exercising, putting on and taking off my face covering, and just daily life will absolutely take a toll on the efficacy of my sunscreen...I get that. But this product from Purito seemed to degrade and become less effective faster (on my skin) than other products I have used including the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and other “non-waterproof” products. The Klairs in particular came with me on early spring hikes a few times where I was sweating my fat butt OFF (LOL!)…without issue.\n\nOne last thing that kind of tipped me off to the Purito Centella Green Level’s tendency to not get along with my skin was the amount of stinging it caused to my eyes. I have had this happen with other chemical sunscreens…but I felt like it was particularly constant and hard to keep at bay this time around. Usually, by keeping a product a fair distance from my eye line or patting on some physical sunscreen to create a “wall” around my eyes will do the trick. But, this product seemed to find its way to my eyeballs every time LOL!\n\nSo, moral of the story. Is this a “bad” sunscreen…probably not. It’s been tested to provide SPF 50+ PA++++ and I’m sure that it does a fine job for most people. But, depending on your habits/lifestyle…it might not be the best fit (just like anything else). I’m not here to scare anyone into thinking that this product will 100% cause them to burn or tan or spontaneously combust (LOL)…I’m just saying that I’d rather pass on this product in favor of a sunscreen that more accurately fits MY needs. Your experience with this (and any other product) will vary. Right now, that would be the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence.\n\nI love, love, love that people are so passionate about their SPF. While it sometimes makes it hard to feel comfortable talking honestly about SPF, sun protection, skin damage, and even disease caused by sun exposure…I feel like keeping an open/honest discussion about it is important. Especially for those that might be learning about the importance of sun protection for the first time. \n\nRegardless of how intense my “tan line” was…the fact that it was there is a problem for me. Any amount of tanning, skin tone change, or burning is your skin’s response to damage…bottom line. Skin doesn’t do it for fun or know that you prefer that color in the summer time LOL! And you know…some of us will take that knowledge and continue to get our summer tan on. While I don’t love that…I understand it (I mean was the exact same way not too long ago). I just hope that people at least acknowledge the risks and really think about the long-term consequences before heading outside without sun protection. The worst option is to see posts like this or hear warnings and ignore them/pretend you’re the exception. You’re not…no matter your background of skin tone.\n\nAlright, thats it.

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I’ve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren’t very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I’ve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don’t seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven’t had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I’m happy to help! :)\n",

The price is 18,600 won, which is about $15.50 USD. (If you're buying it in the US, the price will likely be a bit higher due to shipping costs). In addition to what's listed in the title, the serum contains 67% centella asiatica extract.\n\nThey don't state exactly how much panthenol is in the serum, but based on its position in the ingredients list, there must be between 1-5% in there. (In Korea, ingredients must be listed in order of amount unless it's less than 1%.) The only thing that would make this better is if they included n-acetyl glucosamine to boost the niacinamide, but alas, we can't have everything.\n\nFull Ingredients: **Centella Asiatica Extract** (67%), Butylene Glycol, **Niacinamide** (50000ppm), Glycerin, Water, **Panthenol**, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, **Madecassoside** (10000ppm), **Asiaticoside** \\+ **Asiatic Acid** \\+ **Madecassic Acid** (10000ppm total), Citric Acid, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, **Polyglutamic Acid**, Methylpropanediol, **Hydrolyzed Algin**, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate**, **Allantoin**, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sorbitan Olivate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Arginine, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

I discovered the 3W Clinic sleeping packs on TesterKorea's site for very reasonable prices (+weight based shipping) and to my delight the ingredients list had cetyl alcohol instead which I do not have a strong comedogenic reaction to. [The packaging is shown as white on the site](http://www.testerkorea.com/Product/3w-clinic-snail-mucus-sleeping-pack-100ml) but I received [a pink jar](http://koreacosmetics.eu/1701-thickbox_default/3w-clinic-snail-mucus-sleeping-pack-100ml.jpg).\n\nThe texture is a thick transparent gel. It is quite sticky, especially if you use too much. I suggest practicing a little restraint in application and letting it sink in for at least an hour before going to sleep. The jar is going to last forever. It is clearly fragranced but I can't really identify the scent. There is a subtle underlying citrus note but the rest is a mystery.\n\nI used the sleeping pack on half of my face for a couple of weeks to see if it's doing anything. It is currently the only snail product in my routine since my Secret Key Snail Repairing Essence ran out and it is definitely making a difference with redness (I have mild rosacea). I don't think it's doing anything for my PIE although [their promotional materials](https://cdn.hermo.my/hermo/Uploads/2015/01/images/6ed8a458-a7f3-499b-8435-da184cbbf31c.jpg) stress that point. As for general skin condition the difference seems to be minor. The sleeping pack side does seem a barely registerable amount more moisturized and interestingly also barely registerable amount less shiny. Then again, with sleeping packs the effect seems to be slow and cumulative, and it is definitely doing *something*. I'll continue using it as my skin definitely likes it some snail.",

The Non Comodogenic label isn't regulated, anyone can slam it on their product, and many of these products contain pore clogging ingredients.\n\nCeraV is absolutely amazing for many people and does not clog everyone's pores. But for people with oily or acne prone skin, most of the time, it will. That isn't the case for everyone so if it works for you that's great! But if you're acne prone you may not want to take the risk or may not realize it could be Cerav clogging your pores. \n\nMost Cerav products contain Cetearyl Alcohol, and Cetearth-20, which are both comodogenic ingredients, and even more comodogenic together. These aren't the only likely clogging ingredients. \n\nNot only this but there are MANY posts of people saying Cerav clogged their pores, especially causing closed comodones. And there are many other people posting confused about why they still have acne, or more acne, when they have full Cerav routines.\n\nSo I just wanted to put it out there, this label is not regulated, and CeraV seems to mostly work for people with dry skin. Their salicylic range seems to be formulated differently. Most of their moisturisers say they're for dry skin, but because they say Non Comodogenic, they give the idea that acne prone people should use it.\n\nIt will still work for some! But just because it works for you doesn't mean it works for most people. So if you're acne prone, just be aware of this! \n\nI can confirm myself too that when I used Cerav on my oily parts, it caused deep acne, but when I used it on my dry, it didn't cause any. This means it isn't Non Comodogenic.\n\nEdit: Yes I see the spelling error. I don't think it's important.",

    "body": "So I recently read [this](https://simpleskincarescience.com/urea-for-skin/) blogpost detailing the benefits of urea. And they sound pretty all-around *amazing*. \n\nExcerpt from the blog about urea: \n> Urea is mainly known and used in dermatology for its keratolytic and hydrating properties. In other words, it hits the skin with a double whammy combo by both gently **exfoliating and moisturizing at the same time**. \n\n> Urea is part of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) of skin, which is made up of 40% amino acids, 12% sodium PCA, 9% glycerol, and 8.5% urea (among other things). (3) These are all hygroscopic (water-holding) substances, that are essential for maintaining the health, function, and hydration of the stratum corneum. (4) \n\n>What’s super awesome about urea is that it works on both an external and cellular level! In other words, when applied to skin is decreases TEWL like most other moisturizers and whatnot, but it has an extended effect on the inner workings of skin. \n\n\n\nBut I've never really heard of urea on this sub, and that's what made me curious. Are there any urea creams in AB? For example, I happened across Cerave's new psoriasis cream with the second ingredient as urea:\n\n> **Active Ingredient:** Salicylic acid 2%\n**Inactive Ingredients:** Water, **urea**, glyceryl stearate SE, cetearyl alcohol, butyrosperum parkii (shea) butter, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, **niacinamide**, laureth-9, limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, PEG-100 stearate, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil, behentrimonium methosulfate, 1, 2-hexanediol, C12-13 alkyl lactate, dimethicone, tasmannia lanceolata fruit/leaf extract, **ceramid 3, ceramide 6-II, ceramide 1**, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, tocopherol, hydroxyacetophenone, hydrogenated olive oil, glyceryl stearate, disodium EDTA, sodium lauryl lactylate, xantham gum ,carbomer, **sodium hyaluonate**, sodium hydroxide \n\nBut that's pretty much the only urea based cream I've really seen around me... (I caved and slathered it on as a guinnea pig so we'll see how it goes). Have any of you tried an AB urea cream though? (including the hada labo mentioned in the post)  Or heard of one? If so, what were your experiences? \n\n",

    "body": "This is a pretty long review that I have been adding to and compiling for a long time, so please bear with me. Hair and climate details are:\n\n**Hair and scalp type:**\n\n3A/2C curls, very dry and course strands, low-porosity, silicone and protein sensitive, oily scalp. I am not sensitive to fragrance, and find the fragrance of these products very mild. However that might be different for other people.\n\n**Climatic conditions:**\n\nHot and Humid.\n\n**Age range:**\n\nTwenties.\n\n**Usage timeline:**\n\nThe Moisture Duo have been my favourite styling products for about two years now.\n\nThe Protein Duo was bought approximately a year ago and has been used intermittently for 6-8 months since then.\n\nThe Wash-Day products were also bought at around the same time, and I have regularly used the Cleansing Shampoo and the Conditioner every wash-day since.\n\n# ✨Wash-Day Bundle✨\n\n# 🔹Cleansing Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua),Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-73, Fragrance, Apple Cider Vinegar, Disodium EDTA, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Oil, Polyquaternium -10, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick gel that lathers into a thick foam.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nIt is sulphate-free so it is only mildly cleansing. If you are not prone to a lot of build-up and don’t have dandruff, this is good enough. Does not strip off moisture from the hair strands and doesn’t dry out the scalp either. I use this as my regular shampoo and use a sulphate shampoo every once in a while to clarify any build-up since this shampoo isn’t enough for me.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nEven though this is a cleansing shampoo, the website clearly states that this is not a Clarifying Shampoo. They actively encourage using a sulphate shampoo if you are prone to build-up, which I thought was a refreshing change from the usual marketing of sulphate-free shampoos.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n## 🔹Everyday Moisturising Shampoo\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua) Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Cetrimonium Chloride, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Fragrance Polyquaternium -10, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Citrus Aurantium (Neroli) Oil\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Mild to no lather.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit while massaging into hair, completely washes off on rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI did not like this shampoo at all. It didn’t clean my scalp well at all and the strands felt weirdly brittle after washing. It isn’t hydrating enough to use without following up with a conditioner. However, if I am going to be using a conditioner anyway, the additional step is pointless for me. It might work for someone who needs extremely mild cleansing, but it is not for me. I stopped using after 2-3 washes at most, and switched full-time to the cleansing shampoo alone. Though the fact that this shampoo has proteins might be contributing to my dislike of it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase.\n\n## 🔹Hydrating Deep Conditioner\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Quaternium-87, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Phospholipids, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/​Palmitate, Polyquaternium-73, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Avena Sativa (Oats) Extract, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Tamanu Oil, Honey Extract, Goji Berries Oil, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/​Leaf Oil, Capryloyl Glycine, Cysteine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Low to medium slip.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays a bit even after rinsing.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis conditioner is protein-moisture balanced, and this is the max protein my hair will tolerate. It doesn’t have a lot of slip, so if you are someone who detangles with conditioner, this one might be difficult to detangle with. My hair is always dry, and it felt softer immediately on the first use with this. It does tend to make hair a little greasy afterwards. But after adding styling products, it works out for me so I don’t really mind the greasiness. I have also used it as a deep conditioner and kept it in my hair for 30 minutes and then washed off. It didn’t make much of a difference in comparison with leaving it in for 5 minutes like I usually do, so I didn’t bother to do that again.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nFMC says the conditioner can also be used as a leave-in conditioner, though I have never tried this myself, and do not plan to try either.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Protein Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Leave-in Cream\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Dicetyl Phosphate & Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Panthenol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Polyquaternium -7, Phenoxy PEG-4 Laurate/Palmitate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium PCA, Hydrolysed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Corn Protein, Polyquaternium-68, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Ceramide, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Fragrance, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Lauroyl Wheat Amino Acids, Nigella Sativa Seed Oil, Leptospermum Scoparium Branch/Leaf Oil, Disodium EDTA, Magnolia Grandiflora Bark Extract, Taraktogenos Kurzii Seed Oil, Capryloyl Glycine\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick lotion consistency. Thins out a little on emulsifying.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHeavy fragrance that lasts for the whole day. This is the only FMC product whose fragrance is too much for me.\n\n**Review:**\n\nI purchased the Protein Duo when I was still experimenting and figuring out the needs of my hair. I very quickly realised that my hair is protein-sensitive and this cream does not work for me. Thankfully I had only bought the 50g travel pack. It is very protein-heavy, not very hydrating. If your hair is already healthy, this may work well. However for very dry hair, this will not provide enough moisture.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nI know now that the cream doesn’t work for me in regular usage. However I do keep the 50g tube around for the rare moisture-overload days to give my hair a little boost of protein. I only need a tiny amount for that purpose, so the tube is going to last me a very long time.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n1/5. Will Not Repurchase. Didn’t work for me, might work for someone else.\n\n## 🔹Defining Hair Gel\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Polyacrylate-2 Crosspolymer, Phospholipids (and) Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Polyquaternium -7, Polyquaternium-73, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Vanilla Planifolia Bean Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nVery sticky, thick gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is a very strong-hold gel. It is a part of the Protein Duo, but it isn’t as protein-heavy as the leave-in cream. Even with my protein-sensitive hair, I was able to use it occasionally on days when I wanted some serious definition. If I used it 2-3 times consecutively, it caused protein-overload. Overall, a nice gel that gives pretty good definition and hold. I haven’t bought it again, though I might do so once my current hoard of gels is finished.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n3/5. May repurchase sometime.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Moisture Duo✨\n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Hair Butter\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Salvia Hispanica(Chia) Seed Extract, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Quaternium-87, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Panthenol, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Glycerin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, PEG/​PPG-8/​3 Diisostearate, Astrocaryum Vulgare Kernel Oil, Tocopherol, Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil, Mauritia Flexuosa (Buriti) Fruit Oil, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-73\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThick white cream. Emulsifies into a thinner non-sticky cream.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nMild fragrance that lingers around for a few hours, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis one is an extreme boost of hydration. It is a heavy product, and tends to make hair greasy if too much is used. Since my hair is very dry, this works really well to keep it considerably soft and frizz-free. It doesn’t help me a lot with definition though, I don’t feel my hair is more defined on the days I use this butter as opposed to some other leave-in cream (usually the green Arata styling cream). Since it is heavy, it might weigh down wavy or fine hair. But for tighter curl patterns and/or coarser drier hair, this is great.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. But for better definition, I prefer always using the gelly with it.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased. \n\n## 🔹Curl-Quenching Flaxseed Gelly\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\nWater (Aqua), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Extract, Sorbitol, Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Salvia Hispanica (Chia! Seed Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Oil, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-73, Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Fragrance, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Vinegar\n\n**Texture, Consistency details:**\n\nThin to medium, non-sticky gel.\n\n**Fragrance:**\n\nHas mild fragrance. Stays for a few minutes, then fades away.\n\n**Review:**\n\nThis is protein-free and quite hydrating honestly. Has a lot of slip, so it is a nice experience to style. It doesn’t have a lot of hold. Curls last for a day or two maximum, and that is after all protective measures like a satin pillowcase, satin scrunchies, etc. If long-lasting curls are not a goal for you, and you don’t mind refreshing more frequently, I would highly recommend this. The Moisture Bundle would probably be my most highly recommended FMC products.\n\n**Miscellaneous Notes About Product:**\n\nThe product label mentions that it can be used as a one and done styling product. I do use it as my sole styler sometimes, and it works out fine.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n5/5. Have repurchased.\n\n# \n\n# ✨Miscellaneous Notes About Fix My Curls✨\n\nFix My Curls website used to have the full ingredients list of their products on the product pages prominently displayed. However during their recent website update, they have replaced it with Key Ingredients. So, minus points for that from me.They do have a photo of the back label in the product images, which shows the ingredients, but I feel that is not good enough. I prefer having the ingredients easily accessible. \n\nThey always have some kind of sale, discount offers, freebie offers, etc on their website. A lot of Indian Curly Hair Influencers also have affiliate codes for FMC. If you are planning to buy anything, I’d recommend comparing prices from the official seller on Amazon and the website during sales. I would have included other platforms like Nykaa, Foxy, Purpple, etc, but they are pretty much always out of stock or very highly priced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# ✨Frequently Asked Questions✨\n\n🔹How do I find my curl type/porosity?\n\nI used [this quiz](https://www.naturallycurly.com/quiz)!\n\n🔹How do I know whether my hair needs moisture or protein?\n\n[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/mzhv17/haircare_guide_to_proteinmoisture_balance/) might help.\n\n&#x200B;",

Thank you for the reviews.\n\nI've seen FMC go upto 35%off on kindlife & 30%off on their own website.\n\nEdit - I have fine 2a wavy hair, & medium porosity from what I can tell. I'm hair dumb tbh. I use FMC leave in cream, hair mousse & defining hair gel & quite like them as they don't weigh down my hair while making them soft enough. Provide moderate hold & don't make them look crunchy. \n\nI agree with your assessment that they don't provide much moisture. So sm1 with Frizzy or dry hair would need other more rich / moisturizing products.\n\nThe leave in cream & mousse are my more used products, I haven't quite figured out how to use the gel properly yet.",

    "body": "Before I boarded the plane in Northern California, I was flipping through my Facebook when I was served an ad for a new Paula's Choice product: the [Azelaic Acid Booster](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds). Of course, as an azelaic acid devotee, my interest was piqued. I flipped through the ingredients and quickly realized I had used this product before, shipped and sold to me from the EU in the silver packaging of the [RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html#2). \n\nUp until recently, you could have this product shipped to you from the EU, but as someone pointed out to me about a month back, you can no longer have this product imported into the US. This was fairly upsetting, as the product works quite well (better than The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid suspension, in my experience) and combines AzA (10%), BHA (2%), _and_ skin-brightening licorice root - a wonderful combination for fighting acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation at the same time. I've already seen some people asking about this new product, so I figured I'd so a quick review on it in case you are considering taking the plunge!\n\n* * *\n\n##Product Overview\n\n================\n\n[PHOTOS OF THE PRODUCT](https://imgur.com/a/1Hge05D)\n\nFirst off, I wanted to show the ingredient list alongside the new ingredient list for the Azelaic Acid Booster, [which is now being sold on the US Paula's Choice website](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds). \n\n\n**US - Azelaic Acid Booster Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Water (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n\n**EU - RESIST Skin Transforming Multi-Correction Treatment Ingredients**\n\n&gt;_Aqua, Azelaic Acid (skin brightener/antioxidant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (texture-enhancing), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (hydration/skin replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (texture-enhancing), Glycerine (hydration/skin replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture-enhancing), Glyceryl Stearate (texture-enhancing), Dimethicone (hydration), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Propanediol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (Beta Hydroxy Acid, exfoliant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Sclerotium Gum (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\nThe ingredients are exactly the same, just arranged differently past a certain point. This is probably due to the FDA's packaging requirements (specifically the Fair Packaging and Label Act of 1967), which requires that all ingredients in order of concentrations up to 1% be listed in order of concentration, rather than the actual formula. Similarly, the EU regulates that ingredients must be listed in descending order by weight, up to 1%. \n\nAdmittedly, I have not purchased a tube of the Azelaic Acid Booster, so I can't tell you for certain that it has the identical feel and results, but I do feel pretty confident in assuming that it is the same product formula for both.    \n\n* * *\n\n##Ingredient Breakdown\n\n\nThere are extensive benefits to azelaic acid (AzA), but in general, AzA is an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial ingredient that is frequently used in acne and rosacea treatments, especially with sensitive skin types that are more prone to irritation from ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (BP) and tretinoin (Retin-A). In one study I cited, 20% AzA combined with glycolid acid (AHA) has been shown to be just as efficacious in treating mild-to-moderate acne as .025% tretinoin. In another study, it was shown to be as effective as 5% BP as well as 1% clindamycin. \n\nIt is also bacteriostatic, repressing the ability of bacteria to reproduce, which may be why it is anti-inflammatory. In addition to these characteristics, it is also a tyrosinase inhibitor, with a special affinity for abnormal melanocytes, making it ideal in treatment of melasma or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). In fact, it is much safer and typically more preferred to hydroquinone, which is a skin lightener that tends to target all skin cells and has created concerns due to potentially causing tumors in mice. In an open study comparing 20% AzA twice daily to 4% hydroquinone, it showed to be just as effective if not more effective than the hydroquinone in reducing mild melasma. \n\nThis formula also contains 2% salicylic acid (BHA), a derivative of salicin. It is oil-soluable, making it more effective at penetrating to the areas most effected by acne. Like it's cousin, AHA (frequently found in the forms of glycolic or lactic acid), it helps to break apart the corneocytes that do not shed properly, which ideally prevents breakouts from occurring. It is not as photo-sensitizing as an AHA and in many people it is not nearly as irritating, even being characterized as \"soothing\" or \"anti-inflammatory\" (perhaps due to the fact that it serves as an active metabolite of asprin). Unfortunately, according to the 2016 \"[Guidelines of Care for the Management of Acne Vulgaris](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897386)\" from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, \"clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of salicylic acid in acne are limited.\" \n\nThis product also contains licorice root extract, which I talked a bit about [in my review of Kikumasamune Sake Skin Lotion](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8vxh46/review_review_and_ingredient_breakdown/). Licorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant – with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). “The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.” It should be noted that in the US packaging, licorice root appears after Salicylic Acid in the ingredient listing, which is 2% of the formula, so we can assume that the licorice content is less than 2%.\n\n* * *\n\n##My Experience\n\n\nI went through about half of the tube of this product before shelving it, as I felt like it aggravated the erythema in my rosacea, as most BHA products do. I've always avoided the areas around my nose, where I get the most flushed, and with this product I did have to apply the product there to deliver the benefits of AzA to my rosacean-prone areas. \n\nIt does have the exact same side effects as Finacea, tingling and itching upon first use (this eventually goes away, but is much worse if you are new to AzA), but this felt very assuring to me that it contained the amount of AzA that it is advertising (10%). \n\nIt also feels quite similar to Finacea Gel, but perhaps a bit smoother and spreads a touch easier. It also has a very Finacea-esc scent that is difficult to describe if you've never used azelaic acid products before. It is not strong by any means, nor does it linger, but I am very attuned to the scent after years of using Finacea. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have much acne these days to tell you whether or not it is ideal for acne, but I did feel like my pores looked a bit clearer and smoother while I was using it, though not markedly better than when I use 2% BHA Liquid. Nor do I have much scarring and hyperpigmentation to be able to say for sure whether this formula helped with lightening any dark spots. \n\nOther than the erythema, my skin did not have any issues with the formulation, and felt no more hydrated or irritated than when I use my regular Finacea. It did feel much more efficacious than the Ordinary's Azelaic Acid 10%, which I used briefly a couple of months back. To compare, the Ordinary's AzA is suspended in a very powdery, primer-like silicone formula, which I wasn't the biggest fan of. I also didn't feel like it really _did_ much, and I didn't feel any of the itchy tingle of the AzA on application. \n\nAll-in-all though, if you do well with BHA and are looking to add AzA to your routine, I think this is a wonderful product. \n\n\n* [To Purchase in the US](https://www.paulaschoice.com/10pct-azelaic-acid-booster/775.html?ftlt=branded&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_branded&amp;utm_campaign=sitelink_azelaic&amp;adid=277156189668&amp;addisttype=g&amp;c3apidt=20868919338&amp;CASLID=120196850000133286&amp;CATRK=SPFID-1&amp;CAAGID=21602268800&amp;CATCI=kwd-9808655660&amp;CAPCID=277156189668&amp;CADevice=c&amp;gclid=CPGw8Kmjp9wCFcFMgQodftUMig&amp;gclsrc=ds) \\- $36 USD + Shipping for 1 fl. oz\n\n* [To Purchase in the EU](https://www.paulaschoice-eu.com/resist-anti-aging-skin-transforming-multi-correction-treatment-with-azelaic-acid-bha-m7750.html) - € 36,00 ($41.97 USD) + Shipping for 1 fl. oz.\n\n* * *\n\n## Sources\n\n*   [Disruption of the transmembrane pH gradient--a possible mechanism for the antibacterial action of azelaic acid in Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/)\n*   [Induction of Renal Cell Tumors in Rats and Mice, and Enhancement of Hepatocellular Tumor Development in Mice after Long‐term Hydroquinone Treatment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01783.x)\n*   [A Guide to the Ingredients and Potential Benefits of Over-the-Counter Cleansers and Moisturizers for Rosacea Patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168246/)\n*   [Dr Dray - Azelaic Acid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARIK9RdXPJ0)\n*  [Milady Skin Care and Cosmetic Ingredients Dictionary,  2014, M.

    "body": "The r/wetshaving community loves artisan soaps.  Barrister and Mann, Chiseled Face Groomatorium, Declaration Grooming, Noble Otter, Oleo, Siliski, Southern Witchcrafts, Summer Break, Wholly Kaw.  All that.\n\nIn fact, one could make the argument that the biggest differentiator between this specific community and [other online wetshaving communities](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/your-3-favorite-soaps-2019.579118/page-3#post-10492168) is the brand loyalty that r/wetshaving has for its artisans. This brand loyalty phenomenon has been discussed and analyzed much over the years here and [other forums](https://old.reddit.com/r/curatedshaveforum/comments/ex8jii/users_of_forum_discuss_pricing_on_forum_which_has/fgc4e1v/?context=3) with a range of opinions on the cause and effect: [consumerism run amok, plain and simple](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f9yqbj/titans_of_wetshaving_history_charles_roberts/fj3b6wk/) OR [a natural consequence of gravitating toward communities where your experiences more closely mirror the other users there](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8t14q7/) OR [a blessing, but mostly a curse for the artisans themselves](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/e20yu6/do_fanboys_impact_your_purchasing_decisions/f8uc2aq/) OR [toxic fanboyism and fundamentally unfair to those artisans that aren't considered reddit house brands](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/7p6jn2/dealsnew_products_tuesday_jan_09_2018/dsj9ill/).\n\nWhatever the reasons and consquences for the brand loyalty/fanboyism, one thing's for certain: if you come to r/wetshaving to read product reviews, [you're reading at least 90 percent artisan product reviews.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AReview)\n\nMy opinion is that is a good thing on balance. Fanboyism aside, I think, objectively speaking, soap artisans are doing the most interesting and novel things in wetshaving, and that's notable and *should* be noted by reviews and discussions. In the year 2020, how much more can be said or discovered about TOBS (it's shitty so [stop using it FFS](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/f2hr9y/help_with_creams_soaps_after_shaved/fhcm5sx/)), Proraso (much better than it gets credit for here, much worse than the floor-tarp-and-bukkake parties  r/wicked_edge, Marshalls, and TJMaxx throw for it), Tabac (ghastly and gross, but works great as a soap base so long as you've lost your sense of smell/have a TBI/like to bang octogenarians exclusively), Arko (the urinal puck smell is overstated, and if you must -- but why must you? -- just air it out for a few months and it's perfectly usable), Mitchell's Wool Fat (boring on smell, finicky on lathering, and not worth the trouble even for [people who *claim* to be experts on lathering it](https://youtu.be/mVKu1oZWfww)),  or Williams Mug Soap (no, Gary, your [spreadsheet](https://www.badgerandblade.com/forum/threads/eleventh-annual-one-blade-in-february-challenge-2020-edition.581120/page-13#post-10591149) is NOT helpful)?\n\nSo [Santa Maria Novella](https://buy.smnovella.com/index.php/men-s/shaving-cream-tabacco-toscano-7030915.html?___SID=U) sorta falls into that r/wetshaving dead zone of products that gets mostly ignored by reviews and SOTDs (minus a few notable users who have drunk this particular brand of tobacco Toscano-flavored Kool Aid).  It's not artisan, it's not hip, it's old school, it's European, it's pricey, it's more B&B/TSN/TSD/CSF than it is r/wetshaving.\n\nAnd indeed the prevailing thinking in regards to SMN on this sub and its predecessor sub have been largely negative. IMO. IMHO. IME. YMMV.\n\n[Exhibit A: RaggedClaws](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wet_Shavers/comments/2tmzcv/xpec_and_santa_maria_novella_discussion/co0gv7x/)\n\n[Exhibit B: $have$core](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/)\n\n[I've been meaning to get around to this review for quite some time.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/cvdj6l/review_santa_maria_novella_crema_da_barba/ey3r401/)  Because this nonsense is a crime.  But, alas, my fabulous and glamorous life just got in the way.\n\nWe'll get more into the Ruds review specifically below, but SMN appears to have a lot going against it on first blush. For one, it's 71 GD American dollars. Over $80 after shipping -- though to be fair, it's 7.4 ounces of product in the tub rather than the typical 4 ounces of American artisan product ($10.81 per ounce shipped compared to, say, Wholly Kaw Siero's tag of $8.75 per ounce, shipped...but still quite a bite out your chips).  Two, the [ingredient list doesn't look all that impressive.](https://www.mensbiz.com.au/santa-maria-novella-shaving-cream.html)\n\n> Aqua, Stearic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Parfum, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Camphor, Menthol, Allantoin.\n\nNo tallow? No butters? No milks? Is...is this vegan? Eww, gross.  And coconut oil based? Double eww.  And camphor and eucalyptus. Like Proraso? Naw, dawg. I'm out, right?\n\nRight?\n\nRight?\n\nIt doesn't make sense on paper.  Why would this be good?\n\n\nEven the backstory on the company is weird.  \n\n[According to the website](https://buy.smnovella.eu/ENG/about-us): \"Santa Maria Novella was established by Dominican monks shortly after their arrival in Florence in 1221. The friars began cultivating medicinal herbs in their gardens to prepare medications, balms and ointments for\ntheir convent’s small infirmary.\"\n\nThey continue: \"Following the Italian government’s confiscation of the church’s assets, in 1866 the pharmacy became a state owned enterprise; nevertheless it was transferred to Cesare Augusto Stefani, nephew of Officina’s last monastic director.\"\n\nSo setting aside the little bit of minutiae that, no Italianxirs, monks and friars [are NOT the same thing](http://priestvocation.com/difference-between-monks-friars-priests-and-brothers/) and the words aren't interchangeable, the whole thing sounds absurd.  [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), inventor of Occam's Razor, father of modern epistemology -- not [episiotomy, mind you, common mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy) -- was a friar, lived out with the people, tended the flock.  [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther), famous for fucking up the entirety of Christianity, lived in the monastery with his bros when he was a monk. For fuck's sake, Santa Maria Novella, were they friars or were they monks? Hmmm?\n\nBut at any rate, the monk vs. friar thing notwithstanding, how did a line of shaving products get started? \n\nSo we got Middle Age monks, living a life of poverty and celibacy, scribing ancient manuscripts with quills, cooking up tinctures and herbal remedies for gout and unbalanced blood humors from the bounties of their herb garden and shit, and then one day one monk looked at another monk and said \"I got it, Giuseppe. We'll make shave cream\"? And that's what they did right up to the point that proto-fascists ganked all the their shit and put them out on the streets? And then later the fascists sold their shit back to a monk's nephew?\n\nSo many questions.\n\nWas the Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in the original monk recipe? \n\nCan you grow Tetra-Di-T-Butlyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate in a monastic herb garden? \n\nDo Italian monks study chemistry?\n\nAnd if they did, don't you think it'd be fair if the University of Notre Dame would give them a full academic scholarship? \n\nBecause how would that not be fair?\n\nBut then they'd have to uproot their lives and move from the monasteries of Italy all the way to South Bend, Indiana. Talk about culture shock, my god. But on the other hand, you just KNOW Friar Tuck would straight own your ass at beer pong in a fraternity house full of Notre Dame undergrads.  But that still wouldn't work, logistical nightmares and what not. Unless, of course, Notre Dame could offer on-line classes. \n\n*Hey Alexa, do monks use computers?*\n\n[Whoa, they do.](https://www.trappist.net/) Maybe this could work.\n\n\nYeah, so it's weird.  And it doesn't look like it should be worth a damn. One would be forgiven for thinking it was something like overpriced Italian Martin de Candre by monks. \n\nAnd back to the Ruds review. Our faithful r/wetshaving correspondent had this to say about SMN:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is an easy loader. It is not a very thirsty soap and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble whipped cream. Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are very good. There are many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave is good, but a proper post shave routine will be a must when using this soap. Overall this soap doesn’t knock my socks off but provides enough for a serviceable shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ShaveScore of 84. For similar lather performance I suggest Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.\n\n\nKephkinh or Wild West Shaving Company? Ouch. I don't know what either one of those two things are, but it can't be good.  I'm assuming this is akin to saying to someone \"for a face similar to yours, I suggest taking a look at either Bruce Vilanch or unmasked Kylo Ren or James Brown's domestic violence mugshot.\"\n\nBut ackshully I see the problem.  Emphasis all mine. To wit:\n\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base is ***an easy loader.*** \n\n\nNo, sir.  \n\n\n> It is ***not*** a very thirsty soap\n\nNo, sir.\n\n\n> when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ***whipped cream***.\n\nNo, sir.\n\n> There ***are*** many soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering.\n\nNo, sir.\n\nIn fact, I own very few soaps slicker than SMN. \n\n\nWere I to fix Ruds' review, it would go like this:\n\n> I rate this as mid firm and the soap base ~~is an easy loader~~ requires a fairly heavy load and a little more effort than you're probably expecting.  Load it like you'd load Wholly Kaw Donkey Milk. Don't hate-bang it, but definitely get in there, work those hips, and throw some lather around. Don't be lazy. It is ~~not~~ most definitely a very thirsty soap that you should either Marco Method, [SkidMarko Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/87rjn5/welcome_wednesday_and_simple_questions_newbie/dwfopr2/) or [Pajeet Method](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/dwcjs9/why_your_lather_is_terrible_even_though_you_think/), and when dialed in, the consistency of the lather will resemble ~~whipped cream~~ a wet, damn near drippin' mess . Slickness in terms of both primary and residual slickness are ~~very~~ elite-level good but decidedly on this side of Milksteak and Excelsior and Siero, but still slick as Rick. There are ~~many~~ precious few soaps that are noticeably slicker than this offering. Post shave ~~is good~~ doesn't matter one single bit, you waterheads, ~~but~~ and a proper post shave routine ~~will be~~ is a must when using ~~this~~ any soap because soap is soap and not some magic moisturizing substance. It'll dry you out, just like every other soap. Use lotions and shit to combat this. Stop being weird. This isn't hard.   Overall this soap ~~doesn’t~~ knocks ~~my socks off~~ the pussy out like fight night, ~~but~~ and provides enough for a ~~serviceable~~ superb shave. As such the Crema da Barba receives a ~~ShaveScore~~ PooterScore of ~~84~~ of [\"gyeah\".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCTN30-YOCQ&feature=youtu.be&t=21) For similar lather performance I suggest ~~Kepkinh or Wild West Shaving Co.~~ you just stop trying to compare every single soap against every other soap with weird metrics in an increasingly unwieldy database of numerical scores, and just live your life, you know. Twist cabbage off instinct. Blunts and broads, tits and bras, menage-a-tois, sex in expensive cars. In other words, enjoy your morning shave for yourself. For your own, personal face. For you own personal neck-meat. For your own, personal man-cans. \n\nAs to the scent, it's not at all like Proraso. Interested in the soap, but don't want to spend $80 and discover you don't like the scent?  It smells exactly like [this.](https://groomatorium.com/products/razorock-santa-maria-del-fiore-lozione-dopo-barba?_pos=1&_sid=b386af327&_ss=r)   This is one of the few times it's okay to lean on RazoRock (though *do* buy it from The Groomatorium, if you're able).  It's spot on. But definitely skip the RazoRock Santa Maria Del Fiore soap. It smells great, but the soap base itself is straight flaming garbage, homie, and despite the claims, it's nowhere close to SMN, the genuine article's, performance.\n\n**Disclosure**: [I paid for SMN with my own money via a 4-way tub split...which is a great way to buy this if you have 3 other close-knit bros or friars or monks you can get with.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wet_shave/comments/84w3ns/santa_maria_novella_split/) You don't need 7.4 ounces of soap at $80, do you? But 1.85 ounces at $20? Now you're talking sense, my friar.",

    "body": "Hey ScA! I recently lapsed on my skincare routine, so I decided that I should do a review of my main products as I add them back into my routine. This review will be mainly overall experience, with some recent insights. I have more products that I have used in the past, but I decided to only review ones I have a lot of experience with so far. The only product I don't have reviewed from my routine is the Advanced Retinoid - as I just reintroduced that back into my routine in the last week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n*AM*\n\n1.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n2.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n3.\tTO Niacinamide over whole face\n4.\tApply TO Caffeine to under eye\n5.\tFormula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free moisturizer over whole face\n6.\tIf using sunscreen, use Etude House Sunprise\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*PM*\n\n1.\tIf wearing makeup, I use baby oil to remove\n2.\tCleanse with Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser and green tea konjac sponge\n3.\tTone with Thayer’s Witch Hazel in Rose Petal\n4.\tPaula’s Choice 2% BHA Gel to whole face – wait ~20 mins to sink in\n5.\tTO Retinoid Advanced Retinoid 2% over whole face\n6.\tMoisturize with Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Info about my skin/general experience trying out products:**\n\n* VERY oily t-zone, normal cheeks, normal-to-dry jaw line and around mouth; light-to-medium skin tone\n* VERY VERY CC-prone, mainly on my forehead (some on chin). This is mainly due to not being consistent with my routine (especially simply washing my face with a cleanser, which is the minimum I need). This can also occur from moisturizer.\n* No issues with acne, except a few whiteheads around my menstrual cycle\n* Most cleansers I have tried are either a) not strong enough or b) too strong\n* Main skin concerns: Oil control, reducing appearance of giant nose pores, preventing CCs, even skin tone, healthy aging\n* Slowly trying to reduce the number of products I use for all the things (not just skin care) that contain fragrances\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Be Berry Ready Foaming Cleanser](https://imgur.com/a/uAvebDj)\n\n***Product Type:*** Cleanser; specifically purchased because it is **sulfate free** (my body hates sulfates)\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Rubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Juice, Coco-Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Peg-50 Shea Butter, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Morinda Citrifolia Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Juice Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Fruit Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Benzoic Acid, Sorbic Acid, Red 33\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance free**; **Sulfate free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; AM: use with konjac sponge; Fragrance is actually pleasant, doesn’t linger; consistency starts off creamy, but foams very easily\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is amazing, and has been a major game-changer for me when it comes to cleansers. I’ve never found a cleanser that worked long-term before this one. A little goes a long way with this stuff – it is a very efficient clean. My face feels so soft afterwards. While it is strong enough to get rid of all my oil, it’s not so harsh that it makes my skin tight.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** In terms of function, none that I can think of. Only downfall (IMO) is it is not fragrance-free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4.5/5 stars, I’ve gone through over 4-5 bottles of this stuff and I will keep it in rotation until I can find a functionally similar product that is fragrance-free\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Thayer’s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner](https://imgur.com/a/OwCREGs)\n\n***Product Type:*** Toner; purchased because of how many people liked it on ScA\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~0.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Purified Water, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend (Hamamelis Virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Fragrance (Natural Rose), Citric Acid, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** ***Not fragrance-free***; Liquid consistency; potentially irritating, depending on your skins relationship with witch hazel\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Despite the smell (see below), this stuff works pretty well. I always feel like this enhances my *clean* feel following my cleanse, but it also leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I always follow-up with moisturizer, but I can definitely tell when I don’t use it, especially in my dry areas.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** **I HATE THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF!** Come to find out, I hate the smell of roses (I’m weird, I know…) but seriously. This stuff smells like a rose pooped in some water and then sold it on the side of the road on a hot sunny day. It’s terrible. If you are remotely disinterested in the smell of rose, do not buy this.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5 due to smell. Will repurchase the fragrance-free version in the future\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%](https://imgur.com/a/Tuo5otO)\n\n***Product Type:*** Purchased to reduce redness/even skin tone and to control oil; side-benefits: helps prevent CCs\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mild medicinal smell**, doesn’t linger; Somewhat-sticky consistency; Absorbs quickly\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** I keep this in rotation mainly because it helps control my oil. Even if I use this stuff without my mattifying moisturizer, it helps prevent the massive amounts of oil that my skin normally produces. It helps keep my skin an even texture and tone, as well. I’m not 100% sure if this is solely responsible for preventing my CC (doubt it, since I use BHA), but I’m almost certain it’s contributing at the least. This product has been one that I have been most consistent with besides my cleanser and what little redness I sometimes develop (mainly due to allergies or weather) has been under control.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Functionally, none. This stuff does what it’s supposed to. I just hate the dropper packaging, personally, of most TO products. It’s hard to get the little bits out of the bottom!!\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, have repurchased 2+ times; will be replacing with skinlex’s version to avoid buying more products from Deciem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [The Ordinary Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG](https://imgur.com/a/roT93Vy)\n\n***Product Type:*** Active for reducing appearance of eye contour pigmentation\n\n***Cost:*** **$* - ~$7.00 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Aqua (Water), Caffeine, Maltodextrin, Glycerin, Propanediol, Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside, Gallyl Glucoside, Hyaluronic Acid, Oxidized Glutathione, Melanin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Xanthan gum, Lactic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Propyl Gallate, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Benzyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; Watery-to-thick consistency (from the glycerin, probably); no noticeable smell; yellow-ish in color\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I’ve been using this stuff for a little over a year, and honestly it does absolutely nothing for my eye contour. I don’t have much puffiness, but I do have decent enough under eye darkness where I wanted something to help. This does not. It does help reduce the appearance with some small, visible blood vessels around my nose, but it’s only a temporary effect thereby reducing redness. \n\n***Bad stuff:*** It doesn’t really work for what I wanted it to work for.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 1/5, WNRP.\n\n*Does anyone have any suggestions of what I can do with what I have leftover? I’d love to use it for something else if it’s functional!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Formula 10.0.6 Seriously Shine Free Mattifying Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/rQeCSUV)\n\n***Product Type:*** Daytime moisturizer; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$2.75 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Ceteareth-20, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Silica Silylate, Behenyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Fragrance, Boron Nitride, Bambusa Arundinacea (Bamboo) Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Maltodextrin, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Not fragrance-free**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; very thick consistency; absorbs quickly; powdery/soft finish\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** Another game-changer with my oily skin. Using this moisturizer during the day saves my face from producing oil. Even if I sweat a little bit, it controls oil. Normally, without it, I’ll start producing oil within a few hours of cleansing. If I use this moisturizer, I’m relatively oil-free all day, except around my nostrils. This is also a strong enough moisturizer to keep my dryness at bay, even during the wintertime (and where I live gets very cold during the winter).\n\n***Bad stuff:*** The smell is pretty bad (probably the bamboo), but honestly I get used to it and the smell goes away quickly. My friend said it smells like wet dog... haha but I don't notice it anymore since I've been using it for so long.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, only because it’s not fragrance-free. Will continue to repurchase until I can find a fragrance-free alternative.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++](https://imgur.com/a/kXZLXCa)\n\n***Product Type:*** Sunscreen; oil control\n\n***Cost:*** **$** - ~$6.40 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Zinc Oxide, Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Dipropylene Glycol, Titanium Dioxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Viscum Album (Mistletoe) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Carex Humillis Root Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Pinus Sylvestris Leaf Oil, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Malpighia Emarginata (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Echium Plantagineum Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cardiospermum Halicacabum Flower/Leaf/Vine Extract, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil Unsaponifiables, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Peg-10 Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Magnesium Sulfate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Methicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Octyldodecanol, Dimethicone, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Caprylate, Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Cellulose Gum\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Mineral sunscreen**; **Not fragrance-free**; **Mild whitecast**, but absorbs well; **Drying**; mattifying/oil-control like a boss; pleasant scent; not waterproof\n\n***Length of use:*** 9-12 months\n\n***My experience:*** Due to drying my skin out, I only use this product when I have to. I don’t wear SPF most days (work inside, very little exposure to sun during the day), but I do wear this when I’m running errands and/or trying to control my oil more than I can with the moisturizer mentioned previously. This stuff works really well to control oil – the best of any product I’ve tried so far. Wears well under makeup, as long as my dry skin is kept controlled. Some minor white cast, but with my skin it absorbs and isn’t visible (even when I’m tanner) – but may not be the same on someone with a darker than medium skin tone.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** This product is very drying. It works SO WELL on controlling oil, but it zaps any amount of moisture out of my dry spots. To the point where I have to counteract the dryness in my PM routine. Do not recommend for people with sensitive skin, or dry skin.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 3/5, due to drying and not being fragrance-free; Will continue to repurchase until I find an alternative that controls my oil as well as this does, if ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Gel Exfoliant](https://imgur.com/a/X9YEexN)\n\n***Product Type:*** Chemical exfoliant; meant to prevent/reduce CCs and help with overall skin texture\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$8.80 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Methylpropanediol, Butylene Glycol, (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Phytosphingosine (skin-renewing), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Vitis Vinifera Seed Extract (grape extract/antioxidant), Camellia Sinensis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (green tea/antioxidant) Epilobium Angustifolium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract (willow herb/skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH-adjusting), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **Fragrance-free**; **BHA**; thick consistency, absorbs slowly\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** This stuff is AMAZING! It attacks any signs of CCs overnight, and can easily clear my CC-prone forehead within a day or two. I use it almost every day as a preventative. My face has been noticeably clearer and smoother thanks to this product. Also, it visibly reduces the appearances of pores - this combined with the retinol I use has been an amazing in reducing their appearance.\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Smells chemical, so may be off-putting to some people. Absorbs slowly, so you should leave room in your routine for that.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 5/5, WRP. I am going to be trying to the liquid version (I got it on sale), but if this works better for me over the liquid I will come back to it\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***Product:*** [Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Moisturizer](https://imgur.com/a/BDGVfpd)\n\n***Product Type:*** PM moisturizer; light-weight\n\n***Cost:*** **$$** - ~$9.50 USD per oz\n\n***Ingredients:*** Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/vinyl Dimenticone Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethaqnol, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethiconol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, C12-14 Pareth -12, Sodium Hydroxide, Blue 1\n\n***The nitty gritty:*** **NOT Fragrance-free**; **Contains silicones**; **Contains fatty alcohols**; **Contains hyaluronic acid**; Very light-weight moisturizer.\n\n***Length of use:*** >1 year\n\n***My experience:*** I love this product. It was the first moisturizer I tried when I embarked on my skincare journey, and I am so thankful I found it. This is the first moisturizer I used every in my life that didn’t break me out or lead to a forehead full of CCs. I’m in love with this stuff! It is light enough for my super oily spots (which is not due to being dry, it’s just oily…) and is strong enough for my dry spots. In the winter I use a little extra HA serum over my whole face and it works like a charm. I’ve been dabbling with some oils as well, but so far I haven’t found it necessary in the summer because this moisturizer works so well!\n\n***Bad stuff:*** Nothing, just that it’s not fragrance free.\n\n***Rating/Repurchase:*** 4/5, because of fragrance. Will continue to RP until I can find an alternative that I can afford and is fragrance free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading, everyone! I hope this is helpful, as I use some products that you don't see a lot around here (as well as some you do...). This is definitely a more simplified version of my routine, but that may be a good thing, as I'm noticing the same effects as to what I was seeing before despite reducing the number of products I use!",

    "body": "**Skin type:** Oily, sensitive (easily inflamed), acne-prone, minor-moderate PIH and PIE, very slow healing - and if course, prone to fungal acne\n\n**Age:** 30\n\n**Climate:** Hot and humid\n\nA year ago I made my first post on this sub, [FUNGAL SAFE PRODUCTS and routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). \n\nThe comments and messages I got from that post were really heartwarming, because struggling with malassezia, whether it's folliculitis (\"fungal acne\") or seborrheic dermatitis (\"seb derm\") is fucking FRUSTRATING 😂 And it can feel like this absolutely tragic, lonely cursed thing - like acne, but more confusing. As with having sensitive or very acne-prone skin, or allergies to common skincare ingredients, it also just sucks, not being able to use what feels like almost EVERY skincare product that's popular or trending or just interesting. It's like being left out 🤷🏽‍♀️ It was pretty cathartic to hear from people that the post gave them something, at least someplace to start. So they didn't feel like they were just thrown in the deep end of some unsolvable mystery. \n\nThankfully, since that post I've learned of more products (and new products have come out) that are malassezia safe. It's been great being a part of this community from the day I found it. So I wanted to keep paying it forward, make the struggle a bit easier if I could ☺❤\n\n#Ingredient list checker\nI now suggest FolliculitisScout over Sezia. Isn't as easy on the eyes, but Sezia doesn't flag things like cetearyl alcohol, which as per the latest update on the [legendary SimpleSkincareScience blog page on fungal-safe ingredients](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) does feed the fungus. I will say - depends on where your skin is at. If your malassezia is mostly under control, cetearyl alcohol *may* be fine for you. As with everything in personal care - it's pretty personal 😂 YMMV! \n\nThis is my current fungal-safe skincare routine, with mini reviews! 😆\n\n#Morning\n\n🌸  **Amazon Brand - Solimo Micellar Water** *(₹199 for 200 ml) *\n\nUnfortunately the unscented version (that I'm still using) is no longer available, and it's available in Wild Lily and Lemon scents, which I haven't personally used. I put this in a foaming pump bottle and use the foam on a DRY face. After massaging it it, I add water and massage a but more before rinsing. This technique is what I like for a gentle morning cleanse. I don't think it makes much difference whether I use the Solimo or the Garnier micellar water I mentioned in my previous post 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n🌸  **DIY vitamin C \"serum\"** \n\nI use the Body Cupid aloe gel as a base, and store it in the fridge. The Body Cupid aloe gel is still my HG for skin and hair 😌❤ Here's a [simplified explanation of how I make my DIY vitamin C](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/so7xlu/whats_your_best_serum_for_am/hw7dpwp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). I personally think DIYing is the most logical solution to the instability of water-based vitamin C, but I understand many people don't wanna go through the trouble for one reason or another. The bare minimum you'd need to have by way of equipment, IMO, is measuring spoons and litmus paper, and besides, you may feel more secure using a product that's been formulated by experts. For me, personally, this works really well. \n\n#or\n\n🌸 **Disrupt 10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc** *(₹275 for 30ml)* \n\nI've been using this only a couple weeks, and I'm VERY happy with it. I read/heard a lot on the interwebs about how 5% is enough and so on, so I didn't try a 10%. But it's been a game changer 😂 Go figure. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Helps a lot with my inflammation and general skin health, which - better barrier = better immunity against malassezia. I'll finish the bottle and do a proper review, but for now I'll say it's very lightweight, slightly milky abd your usual runny serum consistency. \nLeaves skin feeling soft matte (it has alkanes in it, which are often used as a \"clean\" alternative to silicones, apparently). I love Disrupt's packaging. But we'll get into that when I review it for real 😂 I use about half a coin-sized amount. \n\n🌸 **UvDoux Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++**  *(approx ₹600 for 50g)*\n\nI used up my Blessing Tree sunscreen and moved on to this one. It's got a silicone base, so it's basically like a makeup primer, and that took a while to get used to. But I enjoy it greatly now, and have seen a slight improvement in skin healing time and PIH since starting use. Has a very slight white cast for a short period of time, and once it begins to sink in, I pat rather than continuing to rub, otherwise it does start pilling on me. I think it gets sliiiightly white at the hairline if I sweat, but eh 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\nI will say - UvDoux sunscreen does require a double cleanse with an oil-based first cleanser, IMO, and that in itself can complicate one's routine, if simplicity is important to you. If that's a dealbreaker, you can check out my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for alternatives that may only need a good foaming cleanser to remove. Maybe the Episoft SPF30 or something. \n\nAnother factor to consider is that the silicone base IS occlusive AF. I would not recommend using this sunscreen if you're currently trying to treat an ACTIVE malassezia overgrowth and/or live in a humid climate. Might be fine if you're in  a cold and/or dry climate - but malassezia overgrowth is relatively uncommon in those circumstances anyway 🤔 Just a point to note. You may be better off using a water-based sunscreen or (_gasp_ 😂) not using a sunscreen at all, and relying on hats and umbrellas - at least till your malassezia calms TF down. \n\nThe Blessing Tree sunscreen I have come to regard as a moisturiser with some added SPF 😂 We shall probably never know the true efficacy of that product. An eternal mysteryyy ✨\n\n#Night\n\n🌸 **DIY Oil cleanser - not fungal-safe** [(instructions here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq7szk/how_to_make_a_diy_emulsifying_cleansing_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\nI always follow up with a facewash. When my fungal acne was much worse, using this DIY cleanser _would_ make it worse, so I stuck to using plain MCT oil or baby oil, taking off most of the dissolved makeup, etc. with a damp microfiber cloth, and then using a foaming face wash. \n\n🌸 **Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash** *₹60 for 50 ml* . Has glycerin as second ingredient but also a sulphate as third. pH is around 6.5. I actually like that, because it reassures me that any residue of my non fungal-safe oil cleanser is taken off. Unnecessary and just psychological? Probably 😂 A nice, basic (hehehe) gel with very little lathering.  I'm almost done with this bottle, and will leave a review after. \n\nI'd say this is practically interchangeable with the Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [full review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) that I similarly used and finished up this past year. I'd probably repurchase the Rejusure over the Clean & Clear, because anti-inflammatory bonus SA - but I'm considering trying the Deconstruct salicylic acid facewash next 🤔\n\n🌸 **Aziderm Gel 20%** *(₹270 for 15 gms)* - PRESCRIPTION PRODUCT. Only under derm supervision. \nOG treatment product for me. Apparently they reformulated this past year, and it's harsher now (all the more reason to consult a dermatologist before using). I guess my skin just used to it, after years of use, because I can't tell at all 😂 I use a large pea-sized amount for face, upper neck, and spot treating if I have any acne or PIH on my chest. \n\n#or\n\n🌸 **Disrupt 2% Salicylic Acid serum** *(₹275 for 30ml)*\nI actually got this before their niacinamide one, and it worked really well is why I chose to buy another product from them. I'm 3/4th of the way through the bottle, so full review coming in some time. For now, I'll say it's identical in appearance, texture and consistency to the niacinamide one (I can tell them apart because one is newer and heavier 😂). It doesn't leave as much of a silky finish of the niacinamide, and sinks in without leaving a trace. Which I like 😌\nOh, and the pH is a nice effective 3.5. It works, I purged, that's all I'll say for now 😂\n\n[EDIT: Finished the bottle, [full review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/v7wzhz/review_disrupt_2_salicylic_acid_serum/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)]\n\n\n🌸 **Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel** *(₹299 for 200 ml)*\n\nStill a staple in my routine. Some nights I mix this with MCT oil or Moisturex cream, still, and/or zinc oxide powder of my skin is feeling inflamed. \n\n#or\n\n🌸 **One Thing Centella Soothing Cream** *(₹1450 for 100ml)*\n\nThis is a gel-cream moisturiser that has a thicker consistency (probably because of silicones) than you'd expect. Like, it dispenses out of the tube in a very controlled manner. I'm looking forward to reviewing it once I finish the tube, because it's my first Korean skincare purchase in at least five years, and the packaging, at the very least, is a joy to use. \n\nThe product itself is nice. Easily spreadable, hydrating and sinks in fast. Leaves the skin feeling much the same as before application, but smoother and slightly plumper. The price, which I was initially like, big spender, hehe - is actually mid-range, considering 100ml will last me forever. \nThe amount I use for face and neck is maybe the size of two peas. I'm gonna have this tube for a year plus 😂 One reason why I wanna mini review it midway. \n\nI don't think it's a must-have, or that it's any better than my aloe + MCT, so in terms of \"soothing\"... I don't think so. Using zinc oxide mixed into stuff, or even just the Body Cupid aloe works better for me, personally. \n\nI think people with oily skin, who live in humid conditions, will appreciate how lightweight and almost, like... it feels like it does nothing, but it does the thing 😂 It's more siliconey than, for reference, the Dr. Sheth's Aloe and panthenol gel - that gets slightly sticky in summer, this leaves a much smoother finish. So that's a plus point, if you're into that. \n\nI find it unnecessary to use it in the mornings with the rest of my routine, but if you get it, have high humidity, and malassezia, a pea sized amount will be enough. More than that _might_ be too occlusive. \n\n🌸 **Luxura Sciences MCT Oil** *₹399 for 250ml*\n\nHG standby, whether I'm mixing it into stuff or using two-three drops patted over as a last step. Mixes into all my other products without pilling. I would recommend this to anyone with oily, acne-prone skin, even, since it sinks in easier than actual oils. I'm not loyal to the brand or anything, and would switch to C8 oil if it were available. \n\nThe Aiwo C8 oil is, like 2000 bucks for 500ml. I've been using this 250ml for four months now, and I've used maybe 1/4th of the bottle (only for face). So in a year ir so, we'll see 😂 I'll probably start using it for body as well, though, since it's so nice and lightweight. \n\n🌸 **Moisturex cream** *(₹251 for 50g) \n\nIn the past, I thought this was too strong an exfoliant for the face (10% urea, 10% lactic acid in a paraffin cream). Now I'm pretty sure the urea isn't exfoliating (urea is keratolytic _over_ 10%) - but that 10% lactic is definitely supercharged because of occlusion from the paraffin! I've used exfoliating acids for long enough now that my skin tolerates them well. On days I really wanna do the least, I use a _small_ dab of Moisturex on a wet face and massage till it sinks in. One and done. Try at your own risk, I'm still not recommending you mimic me 🙃 I more often use it mixed into aloe gel or the Centella cream sometimes, instead of MCT oil. Especially on days I'm more dehydrated. \n\nI'm using Cotaryl cream instead of Moisturex for the body, and that's definitely stronger. And has a very strong, kinda peculiar fragrance. It's 12% urea, 6% lactic acid, and I use that alternate days on my body. I do prefer it to Moisturex on the body, because it exfoliates and softens the skin more (>12% urea). It's also not as occlusive (kind of like a whipped rich cream). Although it's nice mixed into stuff for the face (again, imitate at your own risk!), the fragrance is just too much for me on the face. That shit _lingers_ 😐 So although it works similarly to Moisturex, I now own one of both 😌❤ \n\nShoutout to u/thesoapmaker_ for putting me onto Cotaryl. If you have very dry skin on your body, or want something relatively lightweight but very effective for thick, dry skin on your feet, knees, elbows, (and don't mind a fragrance that's halfway medicated shampoo, halfway agarbatti) you can look into it. Would not recommend for face AT ALL. \n\n🌸 **Boroline Night Repair Cream** **(₹ for) *\n\nNot a cream at all, just an extra smooth version of Boroline balm. I use it very rarely in summer (sometimes on my hands and feet, because it's nice and non-greasy), and pretty much all the time in winter. Exact same routine, only more MCT oil, and Boroline night cream on top 😌 I prefer it to changing products by season. \n\n#In conclusion\n\nI also have dandruff on my scalp, and was washing my hair twice a week using a double cleanse (second with medicated shampoo). I've recently learned that people with an oily scalp (which is what the malassezia yeast feeds on, which leads to seb derm and dandruff) are better served by washing their hair more often, maybe even every day. Dr. Dray's haircare videos used to be a skip for me, but not any more! 😂\n\nSo I'm currently washing my hair (single cleanse) on alternate days and am probably gonna do a double cleanse with a medicated shampoo once a week 🤔 The challenge continues to be about conditioners and styling products. I've got some Ideas, so I'll share when I settle into a routine that works! \n\nI'd always say to seek a dermatologist's guidance if you're struggling with your skin for any reason and don't know what to do. My derm was like - malassezia is a commensal, some people just have a tendency to experience overgrowth. She recommended diet and lifestyle changes, stress reduction, etc. rather than medication, which wasn't easy for me to hear 😅 But she also pointed out that I was *successful* in maintaining healthy skin with the routine I'd created. Without the need for using antifungal shampoos or anything on the face. And that I'd achieved my goal, really.... Kind of blew my mind to realise. Because I really was thinking in terms of \"when will my skin stop being like this, and be NORMAL\", and it was making me really resentful and restless about my... already... healthy... skin 🙃 Having realised that, I'm pretty content with my routine, and proud of the relationship I've formed with my skin 🥰\n\nYour derm may decide medication is the best route for you, and I fully encourage you to follow their instructions, whatever they may be. I'm simply sharing my own experience, in the hope that it may be helpful in some way, shape or form. \n\nI continue to update the list of fungal-safe products on [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), and haven't gone into too much detail about some of the products here because that post covers them in detail. Feel free to refer to that if you're interested. \n\nHope this was helpful! K, byee! ☺❤",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I had no idea what perioral dermatitis was and assumed all this redness was broken capillaries from a Clarisonic. \n\nIt wasn’t until I went to a dermatologist and asked her about it that she said it looked like perioral dermatitis. I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

I used this in the AM. Doesn’t react with tret creams. Loved using this although fragrance can be a downside.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow S Foaming Facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*currently using in the AM*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid\n\nBrief review: Bought this because i was tired of purchasing 50ml small bottles of foaming facewash since this was available in a 100ml pack. The ingredients are ok. Not as good as oraface. The pump is wasteful and more product is wasted than used. Didn’t cause breakouts. Decent face wash.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cetaphil oily skin facewash** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 years + {*currently using in the PM*}\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product. Holygrail face wash, can always rely on this face wash. I first started using this when I first started breaking out and this delivered well. I still use it in the PM only to avoid actives overload.\n\n>WRP. Holy grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Toners*\n\n**Simple kind to skin toner** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 months {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, witch hazel\n\nBrief review: Decent, beginner friendly toner. I loved using it and so did my friends after purchasing it on my recommendation. The witch hazel was the right amount so it did not strip off my skin. It also had some moisturising ingredients because my face did feel supple after use. Although since the production has begun in India and someone said the quality of the moisturiser has deteriorated so did not repurchase.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist PHA Toner** {*bought on a friends recommendation*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not using currently*}\n\nActive Ingredients: Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Inulin, Lactococcus Ferment Lysate, Saccharide Isomerate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Salicylic Acid, Allantoin, Glycerin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate. \n\nBrief review: I did not like this toner and I was very hopeful for this toner because it had good reviews, great ingredients and budget price point.. For me the one major requirement in a toner it for it to be of a water consistency, and this has a slightly thick syrupy consistency which just did not suit my skin. I kept getting small bumps and breakouts all over my face and this did not soothe my skin or make is feel supple. This also did not layer well with my actives and instead just made my face feel heavy after using it.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One Thing H. Cordata Extract** {*self bought - youtuber influenced purchase*}\n\nUsage: 9 weeks {*currently using in the AM/PM*}\n\nIngredients:  Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexaniediol\n\nBrief review: Absolutely in love with this product for its affect on my skin as well as how multifunctional it is. It does what it says and soothes my skin, reduces redness and helps with any irritation caused due to makeup or acne. The only con is the price point is not at all budget friendly. Although I have been using it for the last 9 weeks and have only finished a little more than half the bottle. Although, once I finish this I might try a different one from the ONE THING range.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Serums*\n\n{*Since I was seeing a dermatologist for my acne and acne scars I used a couple of actives that were doctor recommended and since all of those were rx products I would not be reviewing those*}\n\n**Minimalist 2% Alpha Arbutin + 1% HA** {*bought on reddit recomendation*}\n\nUsage: 7 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin \n\nBrief review: Love it. Since I stopped using all rx products I wanted a serum for my PIH and PIE and reddit had some really good recommendation for this active. So I gave in and bought this and I lve lve love it, in 7 weeks i can see my old pih scars faded and any new red acne I have has a fast healing time after using AA. So definitely have a raving review for this product. I use 2 drops on moist skin (from toner) and it evenly layers out.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Suganda 5% Niacinamide** {*bought after i received a sample*}\n\nUsage: 8 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Niacinamide (5%), Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf (Green Tea) Extract, Sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin \n\nBrief review: Again, very glad that my skin loved this product. It helps boost the effect f my minimalist AA serum. Helps in controlling the oiliness of my very oily skin in summers, and the two ingredients centella asiatica and green tea extract helps spreading 2 drops well on my full face and avoid over usage of products. So, I will 100% keep using this for life because I love it.\n\n>Holy Grail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Lactic Acid Serum** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 4 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Water, lactic acid, caprylic/capric triglyceride, gluconolactone, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, agastache mexicana flower/leaf/stem extract, disodium edta, xanthan gum, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: So I used this product twice in a week (in the PM) and this has a cream like consistency and my skin just hated it. I could see red ness and irritation on my skin as soon as I applied it. I even made sure not to use it with any actives but it still did not d anything for my skin and just irritated it. So, it is just lying on my self with no use and my heart hurts because this was so expensive and had god reviews on ig. So this this brand really isn't reliable. I love the moisturiser but this formula just did not work even when my skin is used to strong actives.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Moisturiser*\n\n**Acrofy Acne Lotion** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 1 year + {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: Good/basic moisturiser for acne prone skin, helped me when I had the worst breakouts of my life. It is creamy consistency and does feel a little heavy and doesn't really mattify the skin. Stopped using it because my dermatologist recommended a different one.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ahaglow Acne Moisturising Gel** {*derm recommended*}\n\nUsage: 2 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: -/-\n\nBrief review: This is an ok moisturiser, I don't like fragrance in my moisturiser so I did not really like this but it did not cause any breakouts but did make my face moisturised. So if you hate fragrance, steer clear of this product.\n\n>WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sebamed Clear Gel** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 3 months {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Panthenol\n\nBrief review: Loved the moisturiser especially in Delhi summers. Helped skin feel supple and moisturiser, can call this a substitute for HA serum.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Minimalist Sepicalm Oat Moisturiser** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 2 weeks {*not currently in use*}\n\nIngredients:  Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Squalane, Glycerine, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Sodium Cocoyl Aminoacids, Sarcosine, Potassium Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Avena Sativa (Oat Kernel) Flour, Sodium Polyglutamate, Undecane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopherol Acetate, Arginine, Glycine, Alanine, Histidine, Sodium Lactate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tridecane, Aluminium Starch Octenylsuccinate, Trehalose, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate \n\nBrief review: My skin hated this, it cause cc all over my skin and was very thick in consistency. I bought this as the the ingredient list matched the one of formularx barrier relief and this was a budget one so went for this. I tried using a normal amount and it was horrible, I also tried using a very small amount since it is thick and even then it just made my skin sweat and break out. So I stopped using and thought that this might help during winters but again just made my skin suffocate. It is probably a good moisturiser but not for my skin type at all. So now just to finish off the product i use it on my hands or as an eye cream.\n\n>WNRP. Holy Fail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Formularx Barrier Relief Moisturizer** {*self bought*}\n\nUsage: 10 weeks {*currently in use*}\n\nIngredients: Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin. \n\nBrief review: I love this, my skin loves this and I really hate that I love it because it is a very problematic brand. But, nevertheless, the product deserves the love, it is lightweight and still moisturises my skin well. In winters I get weird dry patches on my skin and it peels off. This moisturiser prevented it. It layers well with my actives and makeup and it overall soothing and does the work it claims. I am almost one with my first tube and even though it is expensive, it lasts a good time for me so can call it worth the money. I also love how it is in an aluminium tube instead of a plastic one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Sunscreen*\n\n**UV Doux Sunscreen gel**\n\nUsage: currently in use {*only use when I step outside*}\n\nBrief review: I love this, bought this on recommendations from this channel and the texture is oh so lovely. The only con is the smell as it smells like baby powder x old deo lol but still a good purchase.\n\n>WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Miscellaneous*\n\n**Sheet Mask - The Face Shop**\n\nReally loving these face masks these days incase anyone wanted a review, hehe.",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nI've gotten a lot of DMs from people wanting me to help them with this, so I figured I'd make a post for easy reference ☺️ (For the record, I prefer to have exchanges in the form of comments, please ask permission before DMing)\n\nAll products mentioned here are from the original [List of fungal-safe products [2022]](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/xyrgx8/list_of_fungalsafe_products_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) post.\n\nMoisturizers that are adequately nourishing for dry skin, or for use in winter are usually not fungal-safe 🤷🏽‍♀️ What I personally do, and the best I can suggest to others, is to layer hydrating products (and a fungal-safe moisturizer if you feel the need), then use an occlusive over them. This eliminates the usual fatty acids and esters that feed malassezia, since they tend to be the emollient and emulsifiers in the equation while giving skin the required WATER + OCCLUSION. Those are the only two things you need to focus on, and they don't need to come from a single product.\n\nIt also eliminates the need to overhaul your existing fungal-safe routine - you can simply add a layer or two to what you already do. God knows it takes enough work to settle on a routine that works for summer! 😤\n\nFinding a proper CREAM that is fungal-safe is rare, and they are usually just gel-creams. They usually aren't enough by themselves in winter, but they provide some emollience and hydration, still. \n\n**CeraVe Healing Ointment** is the one thick moisturizer I know that contains water, but from whatIve seen online, it's considered an occlusive because it's just that thicc. Haven't personally tried it, but it's an option to consider. \n\nEdit: the (legendary) [SimpleSkincareScience](https://simpleskincarescience.com/) blog has a rave review of CeraVe Moisturizing Cream up, and recommends it as fungal-safe. That review was last updated in 2020 (three years ago now 😱), and since then, turns out that cetearyl alcohol can potentially promote growth of malassezia. If you have had malassezia in the past, and are no longer actively suffering from related conditions (including dandruff), it's worth a shot. Would not recommend for people dealing with active conditions.\n\nHow to layer:\n\n#1. Hydration 💦\n\nUse something with humectants (stuff that absorbs and holds water). Maybe one of the products from the section of the list called \"Hydrating toners/essences/serums\". Make sure to apply to a damp face (wetting with plain water is fine, it doesn't need to be a toner).\n\nPlain glycerin from the chemist or liquid sorbitol (available online) both work just as well as any product - a few drops applied with wet hands is very effective at hydrating. If you're feeling fancy, the Art Connect even has glycerites (botanical extracts that are in a glycerin base) that you can use for this purpose (suggested use at 2-5%).\n\nSorbitol is kind of a step up from glycerin, IMO, because it's considered a prebiotic, which MAY have some barrier-supporting properties when used on the skin. It's also a slightly nicer texture to use.\n\nYou can mix a couple drops of either humectant into other products right before you apply, to make them more hydrating (obviously, do not store the mixture, it will spoil). I did this with glycerine and the Pulp hydrating serum, because it wasn't hydrating enough this winter. Then I finally just started using glycerin alone 😂 It WORKS ❤️\n\nDO NOT UNDERESTIMATE HYDRATION. Every skin type, including oily, needs added hydration in cold and/or dry weather, and dry skin _definitely_ needs it. If you have been using Vaseline or MCT oil or Boroline and you're still feeling \"dry\", that's dehydration, and your skin needs water, not just more occlusion.\n\n#1.5 Moisturizer \n\nThis step is optional, IMO. Using a good amount of hydration and then an occlusive may be enough for you, but if you want the additional benefits of ingredients from a moisturizer, you can add one at this step. Aloe gel is fine, any of the moisturizers from the list should be fine.\n\nThe thicker ones, like Cerave healing Ointment or Dr. Sheth’s Vitamin E one, contain mineral oil/liquid paraffin, which [has been shown to contribute to malassezia growth, albeit slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). I would suggest avoiding in hot or humid climate, because as I mentioned in my [very first post on malassezia](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button):\n\n>More important than anything else, even if you're using fungal safe products, you have to prevent your skin from becoming too hot and occluded. If the weather is hot AND humid, **YOU MAY NOT NEED ANY MOISTURIZER** If you \"seal\" it too much, it creates a greenhouse kinda effect, and it won't matter even if your products are safe, the fungal acne grows. Same goes for \"normal\" acne, to some extent.\n\n#2. Occlusives\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\nAn occlusive is where your choices will vary, depending on budget, how dry your skin is and what actually works out once you try it. All of them have worked fine for me, I just prefer MCT and Boroline for the textures, and because my skin responds best to them ☺️ Edit: I have since stuck to MCT in summer and left the Boroline for winter only.\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (100% sugarcane squalane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure) - the safest and most elegant-feeling for any skin type, and luckily available now, if it's within your budget.\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane - same as above. [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ MCT oil - it's thin, non-greasy, and sinks in quite fast. Even it hot weather and with oily skin, a couple drops is still light enough to use overnight. Using five or six drops as a final step (while skin is still damp) works well to seal in moisture. I'd recommend this if you're nervous about using anything heavier, or if your fungal acne/seb derm is active and still flares up a lot. It's also non-comedogenic (if that concept is important to you), so shouldn't affect bacterial acne... unless you use too much, which is true of all occlusives ☺️\n\nAnnoyingly, it's unavailable in small amounts, so if it's out of budget, I'd suggest trying one of other options, like Johnson's baby oil or squalane. If they don't work, you can consider spending the cash on MCT. It does have the added benefit of C8 (caprylic acid) being an effective anti-fungal. I'm currently using the Luxura Sciences one (currently unavailable 🙃), and 250ml lasts me around two years, used for both face and scalp. Gets used in drops, lasts forever 🤷🏽‍♀️ \n\nAiwo MCT C8 Oil is unfortunately the only pure C8 oil I can find, only available in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks. I used a smaller bottle of this, when it was available, and it was great 🥲\n\nAny MCT that specifies \"C8-C10\", \"capric/caprylic triglycerides\" and \"keto\" should be fine. People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - I'd suggest trying this if you don't mind a little fragrance and have quite dry skin. Needs a lot less than the MCT, and is easily available. A much-loved budget option, one I use on my hair every time before shampooing, and often to moisturize my legs.\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (technically  a waterless balm) - they both have the same ingredients list. There's also Boroline Ultra Smooth, which seems similar to the night cream version. Does contain some lanolin, which isn't fungal-safe (and is extracted from sheep wool, so not vegan) but YMMV. I've never had obvious issues from it, maybe because it's present in small amounts or because the other ingredients mitigate the effect 🤔 Would NOT suggest using if you have active seb derm or malassezia folliculitis.\n\nThis is what I personally use in winter. It warms up and spreads very thinly if pressed on gently, and a small amount works well. Added antibacterial benefits from the zinc oxide and boric acid, plus it doesn't wipe off or feel greasy, like Vaseline\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline - honestly, if you're really dry, give it a shot. Lots of people swear by it. Slug life.\n\nYou WILL need to experiment with the amount of occlusive you use - the safest bet is to start with small amounts overnight and see if it's adequate before using more 🤷🏽‍♀️ Mixing some into your moisturizer is also an option, if you prefer the texture. I do find that it seems to absorb better that way, but I like layering because it feels like each product I layer gets to work more efficiently that way.\n\nI hope this helps those of you who are struggling to stay moisturized this winter ☺️❤️ K, byee!",

When my skin is extremely dry, I use organic shea butter (though I know it can sometimes cause fungal acne, my skin usually responds well to it).

And it leaves my skin so soft. Not shiny at all. I have really dry skin and my friend has oily skin and it looked perfect on both of us. \n\nWhite cast: NONE, NONE AT ALL. And we both have dark skin. \n\nEye irritation: Nope, and my eyes get irritated super easily. \n\nCost: This is by far the cheapest sunscreen (suitable for the face) that I have seen. It's about 5 dollars an ounce. \n\nIngredients: It does have fatty alcohols, so if you're sensitive to it, it's not that good. \n\nProtection levels: SPF is 45 and PPD is 16.37\n\nIngredients: \nActive Ingredients:  9.0% Zinc oxide, 7.5% Octinoxate\n\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Isopropyl Palmitate, Octyl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 60, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium  Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, Polyether-1, Butylene Glycol, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane.\n\nOther sunscreens also have these qualities, but I think what sets this one apart is it's so much cheaper than all of the other sunscreens. You guys should definitely check it out. \n\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Elta-MD-shield-SPF-Ounce/dp/B000PHUKEE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410788423&sr=8-1&keywords=elta+md+uv+shield",

Since then I’ve found some products that work really well for me and which haven’t been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with “natural” ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 € for 200ml, available at Müller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I’ve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn’t drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it’s easy to spread on my face. It doesn’t have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 € for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I’m not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it’s not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 € for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn’t take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don’t know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it’s too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Crème Réparatrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 € for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn’t exactly the highest GMO rating, but it’s the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can’t really comment on that since I luckily don’t have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 € for 125ml, available at Müller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I’m a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I’d rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I’m pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I’m not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don’t find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 € for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don’t want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn’t dry or break me out and is cheap – that’s all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 € for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can’t really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000™, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 €. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn’t have any noticeable smell.\n\nI’ve been using this for 8 weeks now and don’t really see any difference. When it’s empty I’m probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25€ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn’t completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those “single-use” sachets is enough for at least three applications. It’s currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60€ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and–lip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It’s also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "Hey guys. Thought I'd do a quick text review. I'm no blogger or anything, but I do have a test to study for, so I figured I'd write something up for y'all. \n\nI've been on 3 tubes of the Benton Steam Cream. It is really, really good stuff. I recently bought the COSRX Honey Ceramide Full Moisturizer Cream because I hated the texture for the Benton. And plus the packaging is just not cute (sorry, Benton). \n\nHere are my 2 cents: \n\n**Benton Steam Cream**: I have a better \"relationship\" with this moisturizer because I've been through THREE whole tubes of it. I want to say 1 tube will last around 6-8 months. This moisturizer has been with me throughout my entire Accutane routine, and I have to say it saved me. This moisturizer does a really good job at keeping my skin moisturized and **I never flaked on Accutane, except for the first week, where I just upped the amount of Benton I used.** I was able to use any foundation I wanted, any makeup I wanted, no issues whatsoever, and I do contribute a lot of it to the Benton. I also do use Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Toner, too, and I'm sure it played a role. \n\n**The caveat:** The texture is unappealing. When you apply it, eventually as you rub it into your skin, your skin will drag, a lot. I have no idea if it has silicones, but if I had to guess, it really doesn't feel like it does, at all. I had to put a drop of the Hada Labo to mix it a little and it helped, until I started rubbing in the very last remnants of it, and the dragging started up again. It feels sort of oily, too, unfortunately, before it absorbs and settles it. BUT, it DOES settle in and then it feels like I'm not wearing much at all - unless you put too much, which is sort of easy to do. At that point, it will feel like it's just sitting on your skin and it will feel oily and gross. If you put an appropriate amount, it just takes a few minutes to absorb and you can put your sunscreen on! I'd just bush my teeth for two minutes and then put sunscreen on. It was perfecto. Also, the packaging is pretty meh. Let's not pretend we don't care about packaging.\n\nOverall: 8/10. -2 for the texture because the dragging and the initial feeling of oiliness does suck a bit. But full 8 points to just how amazing it is overall as a good moisturizer, regardless. And there's niacinamide!!! \n\n**COSRX Honey Ceramide Cream**: So I've only used it for a month, and only this one jar, so I do have a slight bias towards the Benton. I just wanted to try something new. So the packaging - is adorable. Very simplistic, nothing to bother with, *Boys, for whatever silly reason you don't want to be seen with \"skincare items\", GO FOR COSRX. It'll pass really easily.* It does come with those little scoops but I hate them because they so small and slipper, but I do keep it. Some people don't like jars but it shouldn't be a big deal. **The biggest pro that COSRX has over Benton is that you will wake up with SOFTER, BLURRIER skin almost immediately.** I was so surprised when I woke up and saw my skin just ... soft. With benton, it was without a doubt moisturized. But with Cosrx, it just looks straight up supple. My goodness. This is much, much easier to spread around your face, and therefore it's easy to go with a lot less since it spreads easily, but remember, you still need a minimum amount to actually take care of your skin. Not just a teensy layer just because you can get away with it. I'm still having an issue finding how much is perfect for me, because it doesn't seem to absorb as quickly as Benton does (which seems odd because I would just think it would. But I don't know why I think it would. I may be using too much, still). It is quite moisturizing! I just don't know if I can saw it's as \"good\" as Benton yet because I haven't struggled through with COSRX on Accutane. My skin is just normal and not needy anymore. But I mean, I wake up with my skin supple as a mofo, so that is +10000 points there. But I am using it on BHA and I'm upping the amount every day too and my skin is holding up great! So that has to mean something. \n\n**The caveat**: It just doesn't seem to absorb as quickly as Benton, but I wouldn't say it takes forever, either. Plus, it has cetearyl alcohol, so some of you will be super sad. I'm sorry. \n\nOverall: 9/10. It's a great moisturizer, skin is so soft and supple, I'm obsessed with the packaging! I don't see why it can't be in a tube, though, honestly (but that's not incorporated into the score). -1 because it seems to sit longer than Benton, **but I may still be using too much, even though I don't think I'm using much at all, but for many people, this will easily be 10/10.** When it does \"sit\" on the skin, it doesn't feel as \"bad\" as the Benton does, though. I judged this by waiting how long I have to wait to put on Sunscreen (where I touch my skin and I feel almost no moisturizer). \n\nHave fun!\n\n~~I hope my comma usage bothers you~~",

While they are not the exact products of Beauty of Joseon, some of the ingredients are similar but of course not exactly the same.  Some of the products are particularly popular in Korea at the moment because Hanbang and plant based?\n\n[KIcho Sheep Oil](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-kicho-sheep-oil-cream.html)\n-this product is free from T.E.A, artificial scents, mineral oil, isopropyl alcohol, paraben, urea, heavy metals and formaldehyde.   Since it is anti aging product and is for dry skin, it contains a lot of plants extract(8 types of berries), essential oil, beeswax, silicone, shea butter hyaluronic acid and oils(grapefruit,lemon, orange) Dimethicone is the second ingredients after water.   So, it can be clogging if you do not like those ingredients.  The moisture lasted whole day.  There are ceramide, lanolin, collagen and sea water. No butylene glycol. (press sample, no affiliate link)\n \n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Essence](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi.html)\nThis is a hanbang skincare from Korea. Niacinamide is high on the list along with a lot of hanbang which include the famous ginseng ingredients(6 fermented years). It has floral scent to it. Texture is light and absorb well.  It has Triethanol amine  which some said it is dangerous but it is not a problem for me.  No paraben.( press sample ,no affiliate link)\n\n[Hansaeng Cosmetics RIN Bi-gyeol Soo Cream](http://beautyfaceskin123.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-on-hansaeng-cosmetics-rin-bi_28.html)\nIt has the same hanbang ingredients(fermented 6 years ginseng) in the cream with the same smell but with different kind of texture. It is pretty light and calming. The jar is of course luxurious and looks like a blue pearl. Niacinamide is lower than the essence but it is still high. No paraben but contains Triethanol amine  to adjust the ph.

This was my first sunscreen I bought after leaning about photoaging! My first baby! And we were off to a good start. It’s a white watery gel-like texture, light weight, invisible, but quite shiny (some might call this a dewy finish, but I prefer a skin-like finish). A good poster child for the typical Asian sunscreen, I guess. It is not water resistant, and you'll notice this as you sweat throughout the day: It’s like your sweat becomes heavier since it mixes with the sunscreen (you can’t see this of course, but it sure feels like it). I was also worried about touching my face throughout the day, because I felt I might rub the sunscreen off. I can’t remember it ever stinging my eyes, but I’m not entirely sure. The biggest drawback for me was the prize and how inaccessible it is in my country. At this point in time, I also hadn’t learnt about the proper amount of sunscreen you have to use, so I was probably underapplying, and the sunscreen can therefore have appeared lighter-textured in my memory. It contains a lot of fragrance and many ingredients, in general, so that could be irritating. A little bit of science: If you look at the UV filters, there are several UVB filters; many UVB (290-320 wavelength/nm) filters also “bleed into” and filter some UVA II (320-340) as well. The Uvinul A plus filters both UVA II and I (340-400), but it’s also the only UVA filter in this sunscreen, and it’s also the last ranking UV filter on the ingredient list, even though I’ve read that the upper limit for Uvinul A plus is 10% (of the total product). So, is there enough UVA protection? I don’t know, but it’s probably okay since the Pa is four pluses, so I wouldn’t worry too much about it. Packaging is nice and it has a pump, and you get 75 ml, not only the standard 50 ml.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Avène Hydrance OPTIMALE UV RICHE Rich hydrating cream**\n\n* \\- **SPF 20, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **40 ml/1.35 Fl.OZ**\n* \\- **Probably suitable for darker skin tones**\n* \\- **France**\n* \\- **Ingredients:** AVENE THERMAL SPRING WATER (AVENE AQUA).

It does not have high enough UV protection, and it is not designed to be used as a sunscreen, and therefore you will end up underapplying. I bought it because I was looking for a day cream at the time. I wanted something for my dry skin and this day cream worked in that regard. But never did I ever apply close to the amount of sunscreen you have to apply to get the labelled SPF and UVA protection. It is on the heavier side, so applying a quarter teaspoon to your face would not feel nice. Trust me. And even then, you’d only get SPF 20. I would not recommend anyone to use this product as a daily SPF product. It also contains fragrance even though it says it’s suitable for sensitive skin.\n* \\- **Score:** 2/5\n\n**NIVEA SUN UV FACE ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS SPF 30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

I must have gone though three of these. It has a lot in common with the MAKE P:REM one, and it also shares some of the same problems. It has a similar texture: white watery-gel, which turns translucent on top of the skin. It’s like a glycerine-rich moisturiser. I think it’s less shiny as well – more skin-like finish. The problem arises when you sweat: your sweat starts feeling even heavier than normal. I think I experienced some eye stinging with this sunscreen (nothing major), largely caused by it not being water resistant. It’s important to note that the reason it is so cosmetically elegant is also why it’s not water resistant. I was also scared to touch my face and accidently rub it off while wearing this one, too. It’s smells like sunscreen. If you’ve ever purchased a NIVEA sunscreen, you’ll know what I mean. And the fragrance doesn’t go away immediately either. My biggest problem at the time, was also that I wanted to find a SPF 50 sunscreen, and this one is only SPF 30. I think I’ve recently seen a SPF 50 version of this since, so if you live in Europe, I guess it’s worth giving it a shot. Looking at the ingredient list now, I see that it contains a lot of avobenzone. Avobenzone has a bad rep, but you cannot deny how effectively it protects against UVA when photostable. Avobenzone on its own is not photostable and will start degrading (and be used up) when exposed to the sun or UV light. In this sunscreen, however, (and most non-American sunscreens) it has been stabilised by another UV filter: In this case by Tinosorb S. I think this sunscreen might have much higher UVA protection than the EU requirement, which makes sense since it’s advertised as “ANTI-AGE & ANTI-PIGMENTS”.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Piz Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Face Fluid SPF 30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Sweat and water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen survived me walking all around Madrid for a week in the middle of summer. Boom. What a trooper. The texture is a thick liquid, not a cream, so the opening is narrow so you can pour some into your hand or tilt your head backwards and pour it directly on your face. It dries to an almost powdery finish – it truly is dry touch. If you have dry skin, you should probably moisturise beforehand. It was also easy enough to reapply when I was out and about in Madrid; So, layering it wasn’t a chore. If you don’t apply it evenly it might dry down with some flakes even – that’s how dry it is. But I didn’t feel like it dried out my skin in the process, but that is of course a very personal observation. I would have been perfect if it was SPF 50, a little less expensive, and fragrance free. If you’ve ever tried a Piz Buin sunscreen, you’ll recognise their trademark fragrance at once: masculine and sunscreen-like. It does bring back good memories of summer and beaches for me personally, though.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**THE BODY SHOP Vitamin E Day Lotion SPF30** \\[not pictured\\]\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33)**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

And it’s not water-resistant, so it will on glide on your face as you sweat. But the absolute worst thing about this is how much it stings your eyes. I could barely open them in broad daylight, and I had to go back home and wash my face to get it off. Do not, under any circumstances apply this close to your eyes. I don’t know what caused it: maybe all the perfume, or the UV filters? Also, the way this product smells, is absolutely abhorrent. Old lady perfume, and it’s so strong.

I have very pale skin (and am therefore really scared of “universal tints”), but it blended perfectly into my skin tone, perhaps with the slightest bit of coverage. Since it’s a mineral sunscreen, I’m sceptical if it’ll blend into darker skin, even with the tint, so that’s something to keep in mind. It might also have photo flashback, you have been warned. Even though it is silicone based, I wouldn’t describe it as “silicone-y”, if you know what I mean; it has a skin like finish. However, I don’t think I ever applied enough of it to truly know what its finish is like… First and foremost: the packaging. When I bought it, they still used a dropper – I repeat a dropper. This did not work, as the product would spill over, clump up at the inner edges of the bottle’s mouth, etc. And since it clumped up at the sides, I honestly don’t know if I’ve lost some of the UV protection of the product, since it’s no longer a completely homogenous liquid. They later changed the dropper to a pump, but it’s still embarrassing that they ever sold it with a dropper. What were they thinking? You also spend quite a bit of time applying it evenly on your skin, due to its consistency and tint. You kind of have to apply it like a foundation. Since it’s only 30 ml, it means that you should be finishing one of these in less than a month – and only if you’re just applying it to your face. At least it doesn’t have any fragrance! It does have an iffy smell to it, which goes away. Taking into consideration the cost, the packaging (even though it has improved) the fact that it’s not a SPF 50, PA++++ product, you’re left with a very mediocre sunscreen. It could however serve as a daily serum on top of your sunscreen, if you’re very extra.\n* \\- **Score:** 3/5\n\n**Altruist Dermatologist Sunscreen SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I had really high expectations for Altruist, same as many others, and I was let down. It isn’t that bad of a sunscreen, but it’s also not that good. At this point in my quest for the Holy grail sunscreen, I realised I had to up my UV game. SPF 30 wasn’t enough, and I wanted as high of an UVA protection as possible. With the EU’s regulation of UVA protection (in a nutshell the UVA protection has to be 1/3 of the SPF), you could, in theory, end up with SPF 30 sunscreens that had higher UVA protection than your SPF 50 sunscreen. And as a consumer, you simply wouldn’t know the difference. Anyway, Altruist SPF 50, has perfect UV protection, and no fragrance and such. In theory it’s the perfect sunscreen. I mean, look at all those filters (seriously why are there so many, did the chemists make a bet or something?) But in practice? Not so much. First and foremost, if you have darker skin, this might leave a white cast due to the titanium dioxide. Some people have mentioned this in their reviews and some people have also mentioned it stinging their eyes (I can’t remember noticing this). Secondly, the reason I didn’t like it, is because of the texture. It’s the same sort of texture as the MAKE P:REM and NIVEA mentioned above, just less cosmetically elegant. I thought it would dry down or sink into my face, but it never did. I would wait for 20 minutes, and I would still be sticky and a little bit shiny. What worked was putting a lot of translucent powder on top, then I would finally achieve a more skin like finish. Pro tip: Translucent powder can actually make most sunscreens bearable. Since it didn’t dry down, I felt as I would rub it off if my face touched anything. Maybe this sunscreen would work for people with dry skin? Since applying this sunscreen, waiting, applying powder, would take such a long time, I ended up just using a different sunscreen. And I guess that says it all. It also has a “chemical” smell to it, but that didn’t bother me. It might not have worked for my face, but it’s still a good sunscreen for the rest of the body.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**Skinnies Sungel SPF30**\n\n* \\- **SPF 30, broad spectrum, PA++++ (PPD 16+)**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

This sunscreen utilises a new technology called Organogel™. It contains no water, and thus it doesn’t have to dry down, and you only need 1/5 the amount of a normal sunscreen. You heard that right: 1/5! So, you only need a pea-sized amount for your entire face! But I used a little bit more than that, because real peas are actually very small, so when people say pea-sized, they usually mean 2-3 real peas. A photo from their website illustrating what they meant by pea-sized confirmed my suspicion. But it’s still a very small amount! The texture is that of a see-through slightly orange-y gel. It’s oily, but it doesn’t move on your skin (also when you sweat). And it’s completely see-though so I can with confidence say it’ll suit every skin tone. It doesn’t completely dry down, though, but it does seem to sink into your skin a little bit, if you wait a couple of minutes. You can feel the gel on your skin when you touch it, but you wouldn’t notice you had anything on otherwise. Since it isn’t water based it also feels sturdier than the others I’ve tried, so I wasn’t as scared of it rubbing off when touching my skin. I think it might work very well as a primer. It has a slight “chemical” smell, it also doesn’t contain any perfume or any nonsense like that. It’s on the pricier side, but one 100ml bottle is actually the equivalent of 500ml of normal sunscreen, when you think about it, so I think the prize is justifiable. This was the sunscreen I kept on using when the Altruist one wasn’t working for me, by the way. It’s definitely the quickest sunscreen to apply of all the sunscreens I’ve ever used. A con is that is a little bit difficult to gauge if you are using enough, and that you’ve applied it evenly. Turns out there are two versions of this sunscreen: An American one and a New Zealand one. I somehow ended up with the American one, and it has worked just fine for me. The NZ version uses non-FDA approved filters, but it still has the same UVB and UVA protection listed, but I would still recommend you buy the NZ version, since there must be a reason why they chose to not just use the same formulation as the American one, right? Since I bought my bottle, they have also released many new products, like an SPF 50+. If the SPF 50+ behaves the same way as this one, I think I might have given it a score of 5/5. But keep in mind that it does not have a dry-touch finish (more of an immovable oily finish), but at least it has a sturdy one.\n* \\- **Score:** 4/5\n\n**The Balm BALMSHELTER TINTED MOISTURIZER (Shade: Lighter Than Light)**\n\n* \\- **SPF 18, broad spectrum**\n* \\- **Not water resistant**\n* \\- **64 ml/ 2.15 Fl.

Note that this tinted moisturiser is much lighter than any of The Balm’s other products labelled “Lighter Than Light”. It’s really is a pale shade (it appears darker before you spread it over your skin), and it blends perfectly into my skin: I’ve never seen a tinted moisturiser or BB cream this fair before. However, it is so sheer, that the tint almost doesn’t matter. A little goes a long way, and that’s why you shouldn’t really use BB creams, tinted moisturisers and foundation as UV shields. I intended on using this on top of my sunscreen, but since it has next to none coverage, I never find myself reaching for it. If you’re pale as I am, and you want to experience the novelty of owning a tinted moisturiser, this is a good pick. No fragrance, and I haven’t used it close to my eyes.\n* \\- **Score: 2/5**\n\n**La Roche-Posay ANTHELIOS SHAKA ULTRA-LIGHT SPF 50+**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50+, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), PPD 42**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **50 ml/1.7 fl.

This sunscreen was bought in Europe. America/Canada/Australia/Asia might have a different version of this sunscreen, because of the country’s different restrictions on UV filters and sunscreen criteria (especially American sunscreens). These versions are not always equal, both in UV protection and cosmetic elegance. It also turns out that I have bought two versions of this sunscreen: A new and an older version. I actually bought the newest version first – and I loved it. I couldn’t understand how people hated it (the skincare community is very split when it comes to the Shaka fluid). Of course, everyone’s skin is difference and can have a lot to say on how a sunscreen feels and behaves on the skin. It’s a fluid, so you have to shake it thoroughly. It takes a little bit longer to apply, since it’s a fluid. It dries down matte, and you can’t see that you’re wearing anything. Easy peasy. Its biggest downfall is the prize (I bought it on sale) and that it only comes in a tiny 50ml, so you can’t buy it in bulk, so to speak. But this was the newest version (as of this year)… and then I ended up accidently buying the older version online (which might still be in production?), and oh boy, was that a different experience! Not dry-touch, but oily! They looked so similar, but I instantly felt the difference on my face, because it didn’t dry down. Absolutely horrible in comparison, I felt so gross. You can tell the new version from the old from the packaging: The newest version has “ANTI-OXYDANT” written underneath the “UVB + UVA” text. It has a similar texture as the Piz Buin mentioned above, but I personally think the Piz Buin is superior in texture: even more dry-touch. But the shaka outshines almost all sunscreens in terms of UVB and UVA protection, and it doesn’t have any irritating fragrance to boot. I thought this would be my final HG sunscreen, because it couldn’t get any better in terms of UV protection and cosmetic elegance.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5 (new “ANTI-OXYDANT” version, 2019) (old version: 4/5, because it still has great UV protection, okay?)\n\n**EVY TECHNOLOGY SUNSCREEN MOUSSE SPF 50**\n\n* \\- **SPF 50, European Recommendation (UVA-PF/SPF > 0.33), 5 Boots stars**\n* \\- **Water resistant**\n* \\- **100 ml/3.4 Fl.

I found it. Perfect texture, high UV protection, and relatively affordable. It also comes in a 100 ml bottle, not a 50 ml, which I appreciate. According to EVY, their sunscreens work differently than other sunscreens, because they don’t lay on top of your skin and form a film, but instead they sink into the skin (stratum corneum, I presume). Because of this, they’re very water resistant and sturdy. You shake the bottle, turn it upside down, and squeeze out a golf ball-sized blob of mousse. (This mousse holds its shape pretty well and you can play with it.) Then I just rub the mousse into my face: first it turns into a light-weight white cream… and then it disappears into the skin. After a couple of minutes, there is no trace of it, but if I’ve applied to much there might be some stickiness. It certainly feels like it sinks into the skin, because it’s very hydrating. The other sunscreens I’ve liked, I’ve liked for their dry-touch finish, but with EVY I don’t need to worry about it, because I can’t feel it on my face when I touch (well, technically my face feels like it’s been hydrated) and it doesn’t do anything when I sweat. A Youtuber reviewed EVY and said that the Boots star system is only marketing – it’s not. While we have a universal measurement of UVB: SPF, we’ve later realised that UVA also causes skin damage and cancer, but we still haven’t been able to agree on one universal measurement or requirement. The Boots Star Rating system with a maximum of 5 stars requires much higher UVA protection than the European Recommendation, where the UVA protection only needs to be 1/3 of the SPF. Gothamista, however, really liked EVY. It has no fragrance, but a light aerosol smell that goes away. Because of the packaging, no preservatives are needed. It also contains some antioxidants. I’m already on my third bottle of EVY, and I will continue to purchase it in the future.\n* \\- **Score:** 5/5\n\nSome sunscreens I’ve heard good things about and might want to try one day: Anessa sunscreens, Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++, Ultrasun sunscreens, Bioderma Photoderm Max Cream SPF50+.",

It’s a creamy lotion texture out of the bottle. When you add water to it, it foams up and washes off like any other foaming cleanser. No noticeable fragrance.\n\nApplication: I use it two ways. First, if I want to take off any light makeup I rub it all over my dry face and it melts makeup off, then I add water it it and cleanse. Second way, I use it as a regular cleanser taking a pump in palm adding water to it and rubbing it all over my face, washing it off with water\n\n**10/10. Excellent. No notes. HG**.

Foams up well on wet face.\n\nApplication: It’s a wash off BP product. I use it 2x a week. I apply on face, neck and underarms. I leave it on for 5min and wash it off with water. I think it works better this way. If I leave it on for too long it does dry out my skin.\n\nI use it as a body wash too. It helped me with active acne on my face and back. I find it Better than other BP bodywashes and facewashes I tried. It doesn’t strip my skin. I do use a thick moisturiser after this.\n\n**9/10**.

It was the only niacinamide product I was using at the time. I don’t like it for colder weather as my skin becomes drier. Excellent in hot weather at night. Helps oil control and the usual niacinamide things. It might feel heavy if you have super oily skin.\n\n**10/10.** No Nonsense night moisturizer in a pump bottle!!! **WRP**.\n\nIngredients : AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, NIACINAMIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), CETEARETH-20, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIISOSTEARATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\n**CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (White Tub)**\n\nTexture: Thick and gooey. The only CeraVe product that has a strange plastic/fevicol smell. The brand says there is no added fragrance so maybe it's just me. \n\nApplication: Applies smooth. Feels super super heavy on my face. I could just feel it sitting heavy on my skin. It didn’t give me any CCs. I used the rest of the tub as a body moisturizer. Great as a body moisturizer.\n\n**4/10.** The tub packaging too is disappointing. **WNRP.**\n\nIngredients: AQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARETH-20, [PETROLATUM](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/petrolatum), POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, CERAMIDE EOP, CARBOMER, [DIMETHICONE](https://www.cerave.com/ingredients-in-cerave/dimethicone), BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, CHOLESTEROL, PHENOXYETHANOL, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, TOCOPHEROL, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, XANTHAN GUM, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN\n\nSorry for any mistakes.

    "body": "Now that summer has really started in North Western Europe I would like to share my first body sunscreen that I’ve recently fallen in love with:\n\nIt’s the Eucerin Oil Control Dry Touch 200mL (European version), which has recently been reformulated hence why it no longer contains older UV filters like homosalate etc. \n\nIt’s the jumbo version of the well known and much beloved Eucerin Sun Oil Control Dry Touch Creme-Gel 50ML meant for the face (European version, not US). \n\nEven though they are similar in texture, the face version is oilier in consistency and a bit less lightweight. \nI use this 200mL version on my body, hands, arms, neck and ears and I’m very pleased with how fast it dries down, how easy it spreads, its semi-matte finish and not being tacky or sticky whatsoever. Easy to reapply, no pilling and modern European filters.  It’s supposed to be anti-sand and water resistant. \n\nI keep reapplying this sunscreen because I like it so much. Be aware, this comes from someone who is very conscious of any shine, tackiness etc! I haven’t tested it under extreme sun exposure just yet, but plan on doing that in a few weeks time when I’m on holiday to Southern France. I can’t wait to put it to the test under the intense French Riviera sun.\n\nIts fragrance is rather intense, which I personally don’t mind, but some people might find it a bit off-putting. \n\nIngredient list: Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Distarch Phosphate, Dibutyl Adipate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Glycyrrhetinic Acid, Tocopherol, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil, Cetyl Palmitate, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Caprylyl Glycol, Trisodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Parfum\n\nI’m open to answer any questions, and stay safe :)",

It leaves a natural finish, feels light and hydrating - like a cool drink of water, absorbed & comfortable on your skin.\n\n1. it sits well under make up. could double as a primer for daily light makeup if you don't plan to sweat it out.\n2. you don't feel it on your skin, it's light, breathable on skin  & does not make you feel warmed or suffocated as my other spf50 did.\n3. your skin looks naturally hydrated after application & i don't need a moisturiser with this. I would say this is hydrating. No sense of oilyness and/or greasiness after applying ie good for my oily-dehydrated skin.\n4. no whitecast\n\n5.can reapply over makeup if you want a spf top up later in the day. Did this the day I bought it. it worked.\n\nCON - I would not say this controls oil. i still blott with tissues. But that isn't a probelm because I didn;t buy an spf to control oil. I just wanted something suitable for oily skin. I'm experimenting with niacinamide at night to combat oiliness, let this spf  only do it's spf-ing, i'm fine w it.",

    "body": "Hello all! I wanted to write an early review of the Paula's Choice 10% AzA, because hot DAMN. \n\nJust to clarify again, I've only been using it for a week, so it's too early to say anything definitive about the product. This is just my first impression. \n\nIngredients (copy and pasted from their website:) \nWater (Aqua), Azelaic Acid (skin-soothing, antioxidant, exfoliant), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (emollient), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate (emollient), Glycerin (skin-replenishing), Cetearyl Alcohol (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (texture enhancer), Dimethicone (hydration/texture enhancer), Salicylic Acid (exfoliant), Adenosine (skin-restoring), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Bisabolol (skin-soothing), Cyclopentasiloxane (texture enhancer), Xanthan Gum (stabilizer), Sclerotium Gum (stabilizer), Propanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\nIt has a cream consistency. I've read that AzA does better in a gel consistency, so if you don't have good results with this, that may be something to consider. \n\nSo a little background: I have mild rosacea, and I've been using Differin to keep my skin clear. I don't have super acne-prone skin, but I do get breakouts. I typically need something (salicylic acid or differin) to keep them at bay. Differin dried my skin out, and made my rosacea worse, but it cleared my skin. So I was on the hunt for something more soothing. The rest of my routine is pretty much set in solid stone, so it's a good base to test new acids from. \n\nI received my package from PC last Thursday, and for once in my life I spot-tested the cream. I put it right on my cheek, where I tend to get reddest if I'm sensitive to a product. After six hours there were no signs of irritation, so I applied a pea-sized amount to my entire face at night. I used it after my serum and before my moisturizer. \n\nAfter two days, I increased to twice a day application, now in place of my serum. I'm hooked. My skin is behaving like normal skin again - it produces oil, even! I look dewy! I can wear makeup! Because my skin isn't irritated 24/7, it looks more luminous, and much less red. Old marks are beginning to heal (which was a huge issue with differin - my skin never healed.) \n\nI'm having a slight purge - areas that were congested had a couple whiteheads, and it takes longer for active acne to go away with AzA than it did with Differin. I'm touching my face a lot right now because it's so soft, so that could also be a factor! But the immediate change in my skin's appearance and behavior have made me so pleased. Even if it didn't make my skin clearer, just the difference in how my skin feels is so good. \n\nIt's 36$ an ounce, but you get a discount if you sign up for autodelivery. They suggest every three months, but I'm thinking it's going to be every two for a twice a day application. Fine by me - now that my skin's not super dry I can skip my expensive serum. \n\nI definitely recommend testing it out if you're in the market for an azelaic acid, or if other acids are too harsh!",

It has drastically reduced the visible redness and somehow reduced the appearance of broken capillaries as well. I’ve been using it twice per day.

    "body": "Everyone’s talking about the skincare items for May’s Glam Bag X they all look very nice and high end.  Since I have nothing better to do I thought I would do some analyzing of the skincare items, will they actually do anything for your skin? Let’s have a look.  So far I think the ones we’ve all seen are: Herbivore Prism Mask, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm, The Route Party Peel, Kopari CBD Balm.  There may be more skincare items but these are the ones that are confirmed. \n\nThe three most coveted items are easy to see, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, Herbivore’s Prism Mask and Rodial Cleansing Balm so I’ll focus my analysis on these 3 items since I happen to own all of them as well. \n\n- Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream RV $100\n\nHas the highest RV and I’m guessing most people are aiming for this, the packaging is gorgeous from the way you unbox the cream to the jar itself, makes a great gift.  Now onto the ingredients:\n\nWater, Homosalate (sunscreen filter), Glyceryl Stearate SE, Ethylhexyl Salicylate (sunscreen filter), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone, the only FDA approved sunscreen filter that has sufficient UVA protection, however it’s not stable hence why sunscreens has to be reapplied), Octocrylene (sunscreen filter) Cetyl Alcohol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Steareth-21, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Allantoin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Disodium Edta, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Sodium Hydroxide, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Michelia Alba Leaf Oil, Sodium Lactate, Coco-Glucoside, PEG-8, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Plumeria Rubra Flower Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\nI know the label doesn’t mention this but this moisturizer actually has SPF15 and other UVA filters, most of the top ingredients are all sunscreen filters/stabilizers.  The sunscreen filters that are in the moisturizer are mostly weak ones or are in low concentration like Avobenzone, so this wouldn’t be my sunscreen pick for going out in the sun.  \n\nThen there are the usual occlusive ingredients like silicones and other ingredients which will give the skin a silky smooth finish, of course having Shea Butter gives it a more thicker texture, most of the ingredients that can’t be pronounced are common preservatives/emulsifiers (ingredients that help water and oil mix properly so they don’t separate)/ingredients that help stabilize the formula, most of these ingredients are in normal moisturizers, you won’t find some of them in most “clean beauty” products, however there’s nothing unsafe/toxic about these ingredients which have been in cosmetics for a long time.  \n\nIn terms of beneficial ingredients for the skin, it’s got the common humectants like glycerin, dimethicone, butylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, that attract and hold onto moisture.  Besides the oat kernel extract and Shea butter most of the other ingredients like rose hip oil, cameilla seed oil, sunflower seed oil, etc aren’t in high enough concentrations for the skin to derive any nutrients from them but they accomplish the task of softening the skin.  The BioNymph peptide that’s talked about the description of the cream is “Nicotiana Sylvestris Leaf Cell Culture”, fairly new ingredient it’s a natural peptide, can’t find any studies on it besides the ones coming from the manufacturer.  Obviously those studies show it’s magic protects the skin against anything oh and it also diminishes wrinkles in 2 weeks....sure.  \n\nFinal thoughts on the product: I bought it because of the hype and nice packaging, it does accomplish what a moisturizer is suppose to do, trap and prevent the loss of moisture, most people expect too much from their moisturizers IMO and that’s why companies are creating ridiculous ingredients like bioNymph peptide in order to look special.  I think this moisturizer was originally suppose to be a makeup primer with higher SPF protection but they couldn’t stabilize the Avobenzone, cos it’s a very tricky sunscreen filter and also the ingredients at the top all seem to be suggest this would be a more lightweight product in terms of texture.  The last part of the cream with all the thickening and beneficial ingredients for skin almost came as an after thought.  It’s fairly scented, the last 3 ingredients are all fragrance, but I don’t mind scented products and enjoy the way this smells.  It’s not as heavy as most of my other moisturizers since I have dry skin and like super thick creams. Most people will likely use this at night but I wonder if it’s okay to sleep with sunscreen filters....\n\n- Herbivore Prism Mask RV $58\n\nIngredients list: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Vaccinium Myrtillus Fruit/Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Terminalia Ferdinandiana Fruit Extract, Salix Nigra (Willow) Bark Extract, leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Populus Tremuloides Bark Extract, Gluconolactone, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Sodium Phytate.\n\nMy analysis copied from a reply:\n\n“I have the Herbivore Prism Mask and Serum I bought both when I was still a newbie when it came to skincare ingredients/formulation.  Now that I’ve had to learn more about skincare cos of the constant crap we receive in beauty boxes, I would not recommend the Prism Mask. It uses “natural AHAs” we’ve all seen it before in other products like sugar cane extract, sugar maple extract (maple syrup, very Canadian), lemon extract etc. MANY of these “clean beauty brands” will treat these fruit extracts the same as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, etc. However they’re completely DIFFERENT!\n\nYes most AHAs are derived from fruit extracts like glycolic acid comes from sugar cane, tartaric and malic comes from maple syrup extract etc, however these acids has to be derived in a lab first, on it’s own these extracts has no PROVEN exfoliation abilities.  Maybe there’s a tiny bit of exfoliating action but because AHAs acids needs to be at the right pH level to work anywhere from pH of 2 to just under 4, from looking at the ingredients of the Prism Mask it’s definitely passed that pH (just a guess, maybe I’ll test the pH later). The closer an AHA exfoliating product gets to the pH of 2, the more free acid value it has. As an example everyone’s favourite lactic acid treatment Sunday Riley GG has only 5% concentration of lactic acid and yet why is it so effective and be loved? It’s because the pH of GG is just around 2.5ish (I tested it with pH strips and got values between 2 and 3 so I’ll just avg it out), at that pH level it can access almost all 5% of the lactic acid in the formula. As another example a product like Saturday Skin’s 10% Glycolic Acid Toner at first looks very promising but when tested the the pH level was between 5-6, making the 10% claim useless since acids can’t do much exfoliating at those pH levels, and the toner can’t access the 10% of glycolic acid and use it properly, making the free acid value basically zero.  When it comes to exfoliating products the percentage of acids doesn’t mean much, it’s all about the pH level and free acid value, if you look at Skinceutical’s Glycolic Overnight Cream on the packaging it doesn’t say this cream contains 10% glycolic acid but rather the free acid value is 10% glycolic.  \n\nAs for the 5% BHA claim, again it uses willow bark extract cos it’s a “clean natural” ingredient, Willow Bark extract contains salicin which only becomes salicylic acid when it’s orally ingested cos of the enzymes in our stomachs, I’m assuming no one wants to eat this mask. Salicylic acid is derived from willow bark extract in labs using a complicated process, thus when applied topically willow bark extract is actually a very good ingredient for inflammation, it soothes the skin, helps with redness etc. It’s good for the skin just not for exfoliating. Lastly the law prohibits any OTC product from having more than 2% salicylic acid (BHA), so these brands get around this by putting 5% BHA on the label hoping people will think 5% willow bark extract is the same as 5% salicylic acid, obviously they’re two completely different ingredients. It’s actually a very good hydrating mask though.”\n\nAlso forget to mention this has zero preservatives not even the new ones that are supposedly so much safer and not toxic, I guess the antibacterial properties of leuconostoc/radish root ferment filtrate can assist in preserving the product however I’m not a big fan of mold and bacteria so if you do receive this please make sure to check the batch code and when it was manufactured \n\n- Rodial Pink Diamond Cleansing Balm RV $59\n\nIngredients list: Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-8 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Cetearyl Alcohol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Oil, Polysorbate 20, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Behenate, Parfum (Fragrance), Tocopherol , Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Mica, Diamond Powder, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Geraniol, Limonene, Linalool, CI 77891 (Titanium Dioxide), CI 75470 (Carmine)\n\nIt’s not really a balm texture, if you’re use to using those K beauty cleansing balms with the sherbet texture or the Farmacy one that will transform from balm/oil to milky emulsion this is different.  When it comes out of the tube it has a oil in gel texture, it removes all my makeup but I don’t wear heavy or waterproof makeup.  It’s heavily scented so maybe not the best for sensitive skin.  It washes off cleanly and comes with a muslin cloth, honestly there’s not too much to say about a cleanser.  I bought it cos I’m a sucker for pretty packaging, it’s nice that it’s in a tube so good for traveling/weekend trips, again the main draw back is the fragrance.\n\nTL:DR - they all make great gifts, as far as skincare benefits....meh.",

Reviewing some sunscreen/makeup removers today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o825xixzx6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=686f4f5f086654b57e35cd8906675ccf223ed22a\n\n**My skin type:** Sensitive, very dry (Actives: tretinoin microsphere 0.04%, AHA/BHA peel)\n\n**I Wear:** Heavy-duty, waterproof sunscreen on the daily, on makeup days - heavy-duty waterproof makeup, especially waterproof eye makeup that is difficult to remove. I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance. Will be bolding main fragrance ingredients.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Philosophy Purity Made Simple One-Step Facial Cleanser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzfesai0y6251.jpg?width=425&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df6aa8bee3c981d106a4ee4e3d071a26002ea80a\n\n**Cost:** 8 oz - $24 (Ulta)\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Coco-Glucoside, Coconut Alcohol, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Glycerin, Carbomer, Isopropyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Citric Acid, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, **Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood Oil,** Propylparaben, Triethanolamine, **Amyris Balsamifera (Amyris) Bark Oil, Bulnesia Sarmientoi Wood (Vera Wood) Oil, Cymbopogon Martini (Palmarosa) Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens (Sweet Scented Geranium) Flower Oil, Rosa Centifolia (Rose) Flower Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil, Mimosa Tenuiflora Bark Extract, Ormenis Multicaulis (Wild Moroccon Chamomile) Oil, Piper Nigrum (Pepper) Fruit Oil, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil,** Fd&C Yellow No. 5 (Ci 19140).\n\n**Texture:** A pale yellow, milky, lightly foaming cleanser of medium thickness.\n\n**Efficacy:** Acceptable as a one-step travel cleanser. Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

The balm arrived in great condition without spilling or melting, even though I received the product in 90F degree weather.\n\n[**Performance**](https://imgur.com/gallery/lQOKRZC)**:** Compared to my HG, the Banila Co. CIZ Original (pre-reformulation), the BofJ texture is waxier and takes longer to melt between my fingers. This also means I slightly drag my skin when trying to remove waterproof mascara and hybrid sunscreen with the balm. I initially thought it was because I wasn't using enough product, but even when I did, I had to use a heavy hand. It takes me about a minute of massaging to get some grits.\n\nWhen mixed with water, the balm becomes easier to work with. I think this is the part that's most enjoyable for me. It transforms into this slippery texture, kind of like an emulsion. I end up doing a face massage during this stage because my skin no longer drags.\n\nAfter rinsing clean, I do see that my makeup and sunscreen have been effectively removed. My skin is ready for its second cleanse and not stripped of its oils. My acne and PIH/PIE haven't improved when using this, nor did I expect them to. I do notice that the SFs on my nose remain quite dark. Both CIZ and Shiseido Perfect Cleansing Oil were able to clean them out and make them less visible after each use. I'm curious to see how this balm would stand up against pure physical sunscreens.\n\n**Price:** $20.90 on [YesStyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/beauty-of-joseon-cleansing-balm-100ml-100ml/info.html/pid.1065078966)\n\n**Rating:** 3/5; Feeling satisfied but unimpressed, WNR after finishing\n\n**TL;DR** The Beauty of Joseon Cleansing Balm does what a first cleanser is supposed to do but I already found \"the one.\"",

Cetaphil is available in two sizes- 30gm for Rs 185 and and 100 gm for Rs 435 (often available at some off at Nykaa). Re'equil one is available in only one size, 100gm for Rs 350.\n* *Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:* DAM- HG/WRP, RE'EQUIL: WNRP.\n\n**Experience:** \n\nHello all\n\nUsually I use lighter moisturiser but winters had me looking for an apt moituriser for my skin, since it gets dry and skin tends to become flaky. I was earlier using Simple Light moisturiser and Disguise Cosmetic's Sorbet, but both of these were proving insufficient for winters, hence decided to try DAM and Re'equil.\n\nAs you can see both of them have beautiful ingredients, though Re'equil one has fragrance (it is the last ingredient, the smell is mild and nice) while DAM is fragrance free.\n\nFor my skin type, I require a small amount of both of these  moisturisers. Though Re'equil is heavier- it is a cream albeit not a thick one, while DAM is lighter comparatively and has lotion like consistency.\n\nI started with using DAM during the morning routine. Needless to say, my skin did not feel dry at all. There was no need for reapplication either. It also did not react with my skin. So overall, I am very satisfied with this. Might this be love? Probably.\n\nRe'equil one I used in my PM routine. Now this moisturiser and I go long back because back in June, I got this for my younger sibling, who has a dry-dehydrated skin which is also prone to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. I wanted her to start looking after her skin a bit so I got her a bunch of products, one of which was this. It suited her nicely, though it is another matter altogether that she was never consistent with her routine. I guess skincare enlightenment has to occur on its own to a person for one to really get invested in it. Sigh. \n\nI also would use it occasionally then, and it did feel a little heavy on my combination skin so I decided to use it during winters. Cut to November, I started applying it in my nighttime routine. However after a couple of days, I could see some acne on my forehead. It probably clogged my pores. I stopped using it for some time, and the acne receded (my skin is not acne prone). I thought I should give it a try again, and once more I could see tiny acne on my forehead. I have since then decided to cut it off my routine. It is a great moisturiser, very nourishing. As mentioned, it works for my sister, but unfortunately it is not for me. \n\nRe'equil's finish is more matte, and it can be seen and felt immediately while DAM can feel slightly greasy on immediate application but sinks in fast and also provides a nice, smooth finish.\n\n**Conclusion**: So for the past one week, I have been using DAM in my AM as well as PM routine and I am more than satisfied. I think DAM is going to be my HG for winters atleast. Not sure how it is going to fare in summers, that remains to be seen. Hope this is helpful for folks looking for winter moisturisers. :)",

My derm was not happy lol. She stripped my routine down to the basics of cleanser/moisturizer/sunscreen. Specifically, she also switched out my regular moisturizer for this one because it has colloidal oatmeal ([https://democracyskin.com/collections/facial-moisturizers/products/aveil-creme-avoine](https://democracyskin.com/collections/facial-moisturizers/products/aveil-creme-avoine)) and apparently that’s supposed to be super anti-inflammatory. It fixed my face like a fkn fairy godmother. I’ve never been an ingredients-person per se but guys, now I’m just like, let’s not even call this oatmeal, it’s more like G.O.A.T.meal\n\nEDITS: Adding more details to keep with review guidelines\n\nSkin type/conditions: Combo (oily in the summers/dry in the winters) with sensitivity/barrier-compromise. Acne scars/dark spots/hyperpigmentation.\n\nClimactic conditions: Hot semi-arid summers, cold and dry winters (so temperatures fluctuate but mostly dry throughout the year except during the monsoon)\n\nAM routine: JUICE TO CLEANSE Biome Ac Foam Cleanser, AVEIL Creme Avoine, LAKME Sun Expert Ultra Matte SPF 40 Pa+++ Compact\n\nPM routine: DERMALOGICA PreCleanse Emulsifier, AVEIL Creme Avoine\n\nAge: 25 - 34 years old\n\nUsage timeline: 2x a day, for 1 month\n\nIngredient list: Aqua, Glycerol, Shea Butter Ethyl Esters, Octyl Stearate, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Cetearyl Alcohol & Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate (and) Jojoba Esters (and) Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (and) Cetyl Alcohol, Myristyl Myristate, Squalane, Caprylhydroxamic Acid (and) Caprylyl Glycol (and) Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance\n\nStatus: Holy Grail\n\nTexture: On the spectrum of lotion to moisturizer, lotion being light and moisturizer being fuller, this definitely leans toward the moisturizer side. But I wouldn't call it \"heavy\". It's pillowy almost instead of being watery. And it absorbs super quick. In general, I'd recommend it as a nighttime moisturizer or if you've got normal to dry skin or if it's cold and dry out",

It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

    "body": "It started with using TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution and Azelaic Acid Suspension 10%, about a month ago. I quickly and succinctly started breaking out, like crazy. Worse than I ever have before. I was blaming it all on the AHA/BHA/, which was entirely reasonable because it’s supposed to cause purging. I'm was using the azelaic intermittently, like a spot treatment. It got so bad that I decide to drop everything. \n\nI stop using both TO products, my moisturizer, all of my serums, I just go back to basics. My Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and NOW Jojoba Oil. \n\nAs my skin was recovering, I decided to bite the bullet and try out CeraVe in the tub. Broke me out awfully (I hold no hatred in my heart towards CeraVe, it might work wonderfully for you, it might not. But I'm jealous if it is your miracle product. So cheap!). I begin getting, admittedly, a little panicky. I look at the ingredients and the first thing I see is cetyl and cetearyl alcohol, so I basically stop using everything with fatty alcohols. \n\nIt was going okay, but my skin was dry. About 2 weeks ago, I decided to try out the La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser and Double Repair Moisturizer. No fatty alcohols, I was optimistic! \n\nThe following days, I was unexpectedly admitted to the hospital (doing fine now!) and my skin exploded. Cystic acne, whiteheads, all over, which I couldn't do anything about until I was out of hospital. \n\nLast weekend I picked myself up the Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Cleanser and La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid. It's been going well so far, at least better than the last couple of months! The only issue is that my skin is dry and the Cosrx is drying and the Toleriane Fluid is almost mattifying, which has made my skin dry, again. I haven't broken out, but I'm not quite sure about the squalane in the Toleriane Fluid yet. \n\n I was going through old products and I found my Laneige Lip Mask. Wallowing in self pity, I bemoaned the fact that it's an amazing product but breaks me out around my mouth. Curious, I went on CosDNA and looked at the ingredients, because what in that would break me out, right? \n\nI was looking at the CeraVe, the TO Azaleic, the LRP Double Repair moisturizer, the Laneige Lip Mask. They all have a prominent ingredient in common. \n\nDimethicone. \n\nAnd it all clicks into place. In the .2 seconds I realized all of this, I had a genuine come to Jesus moment, followed by me exclaiming out loud, somberly, \"Oh. Well... shit.\"  \n\nSo now we're back in the present, my skin still looks pretty awful and dry (I also get terrible PIH, but guess who stopped using her Mad Hippie Vit C Serum because it had fatty alcohols? This girl.), but I'm going to start incorporating my beloved Cetaphil and other previous rejects back in. I'm still kicking myself over it, trust me. \n\nTL;DR: In a long, drawn out TIFU fashion, my skin broke out horribly due to a thought to be purge, and all the products I was using to rescue it turned out to have dimethicone in them. Which, I now know, I have apparently a severe sensitivity to. ",

    "body": "I've tried quite a few vitamin c stuff. I use it to mostly improve overall brightness, fade hyperpigmentation and their antioxidant benefits. Here are some of the ones I tried most recently.\n\n- Ole Henriksen c-rush brightening gel creme: \n\nBought this on impulse in sephora. The ingredients aren't the best with some fragrances and benzyl alcohol. Personally did not irritate me at all. It contains 3 types of vit c: ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ethyl ascorbic acid. It comes in a jar, so I'm not sure if the vitamin c will remain effective after some time since its repeatedly exposed to air and light. Also contains vitamin e, collagen, HA, panthenol and different extracts.\n\nIts an orange coloured medium thickness gel consistency. Its not the type of gel that turns very watery when you rub it in so it does okay in terms of hydration. \n\nI noticed no fading at all, but that’s a given since this cream is marketed more towards giving skin a glow, hydrating, plumping and firming. On that note I didn't notice any increase in glowiness and suppleness. The hydration part was alright, I definitely needed to layer other products before it. It wasn't enough to use at night. I can't really say anything about the firming part.\n\nIt does what a moisturizer does but I honestly did not feel it managed to do as much as it claimed. It was just an average product with a pretty heavy price tag. I still finished my jar of it but will not be repurchasing.\n\n- Laneige radian-c cream: \n\nI stumbled upon this right after finishing the ole henriksen. It looked pretty simillar from the name and packaging. This one only has 1 type of vitamin c: 8.5% ethyl ascorbic acid. This one also comes in a jar. No drying alcohol (contains cetearyl alcohol) but contains fragrances. Other notable ingredients are madecassoside and vitamin e.\n\nUnlike the ole henriksen this one does claim to fade dark spots and brighten in general. Personally can't confirm this claim since I had to stop after only a week or so. It wasn't an immediate reaction, but my skin slowly got more and more irritated and prone to breakouts the more I used it. It might have been the fragrance in this. I tried it again after a couple weeks when my skin healed, but it only got irritated again.\n\n- Youth to the people superberry hydrate and glow dream mask: \n\nProbably the one I like the most out of the creams. I use this as a sleeping mask every other day. Contains tetrahexyldecyl as vitamin c. Has fragrance in it bit no reactions. This form is stable, but the product comes in a clear jar. Other ingredients are vitamin e, squalane, HA, panthenol, allantoin and some extracts.\n\nIt definitely delivers on the hydrate and glow part. It makes my skin brighter and glowier when using it, and the hydration lasts after I've washed my face. Its supposed to help uneven skintone and be anti aging. Didn't notice any fading but its fine since it does make me look brighter and glowier.\n\nIts a yellow cream that sort of becomes a light oil when you rub it in. Reminded me of the ordinary's vitamin c suspension in texture, but much more pleasant. The oil dosen't just sit on the skin and feel heavy. I've used squalane stuff that broke me out before, but this did not. Has a fruity smell that is kinda unpleasant to me, but it usually dissapears after a bit.\n\nI'll probably try this as a morning moisturizer in the winter. I like this a lot and the only bummer about this is the price tag.\n\n- Melano cc: \n\nA good place to start, took me a month or so to see some fading, but none of it has dissapeared. Did feel some warm tingling the first few times but nothing major. Vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid and ascorbic palmiate which are both not that stable. \n\nThis serum has a light, slightly oilly texture that gave my dry skin a nice glow too. I used it morning and night until it eventually oxidised 7 months after I bought it. But honestly thats fine cause this isn't that expensive and I noticed more results when I used this generously. \n\nAlso might be my bad though cause I took this travelling a lot and didn't refrigerate it. I've heard their packaging is good though since it limits the contact the serum has with air and sunlight. Its pretty hard to squeeze it out of the tube. \n\nHas a citrus smell so it has fragrance. It dosen't irritate or break me out at all. This also has vitamin e which I heard boosts the effects of the vit c.\n\n- Innisfree brightening pore line:\n\nDelivered the fastest results. The only caveat with this is that the ingredients contain drying alcohol and fragrance pretty high up. My skin does react to those sometimes but was completely fine with this line. In just 1-2 weeks it literally lightened my entire face. The serum is mostly responsible for this.\n\nThis vit c is in the form of ethyl ascorbic acid which is very stable. The brand also mentions that the hallabong extract here is a good source of vitamin c. \n\nI was using it morning and night at first. The texture is like a light hydrating water type serum thats just a touch viscous. More pleasant to layer other products on it. Leaves just a slight residue that dissapears when I layer stuff on it. Theres an artificial orange scent but its honestly pretty pleasant and not too strong and dissapears after a while. I decreased use to night time and eventually stopped since I got a good 2 shades lighter. \n\nThis line also contains arbutin, niacinamide, HA and other nice ingredients. Really noticed no differnce with my pores with this line but pretty good at moisturizing. I still use the sleeping mask from this line every few days that is less scary whitening and more just brightening. Its not the best at hydration and I definitely need to layer other products under it or it will just dissapear into my skin.\n\nThe toner feels a bit too alcholly for my taste. My nose is pretty sensitive and I can smell it. I've tried it out a few times though and was surprisingly hydrating, it didn't dry my skin out at all. It passes as a hydrating toner and didn't irritate me. Not sure about the long term effects since I never used this regularly over a period of time.\n\nThe cleanser is just average. It stripped my skin and made it feel tight but its not the most drying cleanser out there. I did notice like a slight boost in brightening after using this, but I don't think it lasted that long.\n\n- Ti'am my signature red c serum: \n\nCurrently testing this 20% ascorbic acid. Its unstable and reviews generally say this oxidises quickly. Its been in my fridge for a while and no oxidisation for me. \n\nIts honestly not going that great right now. Just straight up using the serum from the bottle breaks me out. Surprisingly no tingling or warm sensation, although my face will look more red the next day. The only way to prevent it from breaking me out is to mix it with moisturizer, but then I don't notice any brightening with that method. I've tried mixing it with other lighter serums too but it always breaks me out the next day. \n\nThis also contains alcohol and essential oils, so my skin could either be reacting to that or the concentration of vit c is too high. Contains other nice ingredients like glutathione, niacinamide, beta-glucan. \n\nThe texture is like a thicker serum with very sticky finish and it always smells like barbeque chips in a bad way. The worst texture and scent in this list. I think we'll have to breakup soon, I don't see this working out.\n\n- Somebymi yuja niacin 30 days blemish care line: \n\nI purchased a travel set to try out first. My skin didn't agree with their aha bha line so I was a bit more cautious. I only repurchased the full version of the toner and serum.\n\nAgain, the serum seems the most effective at brightening. The star ingredients are 5% niacinamide and 82% yuja extract but still contains vit c in the form of sodium ascorbyl phosphate, which is reportedly stable since this comes in a transparent yellow bottle. \n\nThe most pleasant one in terms of texture. Had the lightest watery texture that dosen't leave any residue after I rub it in, just a slight touch of hydration. Lighter than the innisfree, but less hydration. I layer other hydrating essences/serums with this since its hydration is not enough for my dry skin. \n\nThis contains essential oils but my skin dosen't react to it though. The smell of the serum though is an issue. Really smelled like yuzu (a type of lemon) at first, but after a while the smell started changing and now it just smells like chemicals with a hint of chicken noodle soup. Haven't found any reviews criticizing the smell so far. I haven't had mine for that long yet so it can't be expired. I only have this issue with the serum, the other stuff from this line are okay.\n\nThis serum brightened my skin overall but I noticed almost no fading, although I still liked the effect it gave me. Just like the name I really liked this for the first 30 days or so, but then it stopped working halfway through the bottle. Like I noticed no more of that brightening effect.\n\nContains other fun ingredients like licorice extract, green tea extract, arbutin and many more. Really would like it if it just didn't stop working. Also marketed for wrinkle care but I can't say how effective that is. I also found out through their youtube that the vit c concentration in this is low enough to use with chemical exfoliants which can be good for people who want to mix actives, but not so much if you want that vitamin c to really shine.\n\nThe toner seemed fine to me at first. Trying out the trial version it didn't stand out to me and I mostly bought it together with the serum because there was a bundle promotion. I would always notice some redness redness after wearing this but it never caused really bad irritation or breakouts. I've only figured out recently that it might be because this contains fragrance (serum dosen't, this explains why the toner has a much more pleasant yuzu smell). Its also not good for layering since it leaves a sticky residue. I found a cotton pad worked better for this. I've since stopped using it. It didn't really do much in the brightening department. \n\nThe gel cream was the type that turns really watery when you rub it in and offered almost no hydration even when I used a lot. The sleeping mask was okay, still lacking in hydration and lost by far to the innisfree sleeping mask in terms of brightening.\n\nFinal:\n\nOut of all of these I'd probably repurchase melano again since I mostly miss it as a light hydrating oil. The others probably aren't for me. I don't think I'll be purchasing cream type products again as they haven't worked so far in lightening hyperpigmentation. The yttp cream can stay in my routine though. Personally vitamin c is good for overall brightening but it dosen't significantly improve hyperpigmentation for me.\n\nFor fast results I'd go for the innisfree but then again this will probably only work if you got tanned or sunburned since it lightens everyting. It also has a blend of different brightening ingredients, so it might not just be because of vit c.\n\nYuja niacin is pretty good for a daily morning serum if you don't have much hyperpigmentation. I really like the light texture when I want to layer more stuff. Then again its really not a \"miracle\" product. Next I might try the klairs vitamin serum, but its not a priority. There are other things I want to try more.",

All in all, if it is coming out of a tube as one product, no mixing required, it’s on the outside of your hair strand. The word “coating” makes it sound bad but it will absolutely fade away over time and as long as it’s designed to be on the hair by a reputable company with a trichology background, it will not “coat”.",

    "body": "I've tried all those retinoids in the title and documented my experience on them.\n\n[Stieva-A isn’t present on this photo because I didn’t have the idea for this comparison before throwing it out](https://preview.redd.it/v2pwc2trozbe1.jpg?width=3052&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18d1a22da4349b4f34e144277dbc70c32a05720c)\n\n# Short answer - my verdict:\n\n**Tazret 0.1% > Tazarene 0.1% > MyTret 0.1% (depending on your skin type) > Ketrel 0.05% > Stieva-A 0.025% > Tretin 0.025% > Tretiheal 0.1% > Tretiwell 0.1% > A-ret 0.1%**\n\nBeside negative points for side effects (irritation and dryness), the main criteria for this ranking is how long the peeling lasts because the longer it lasts the deeper the retinoid got into the skin, offering a more potent effect.\n\nI'm putting Tretiwell and A-ret at the end of the ranking because they irritated my skin. MyTret dried my skin enough to be irritated by sunscreen (I use the Canmake Mermaid Skin clear) but I can see how a person with oily skin might do well on it or how it would be fine if I spaced applications a lot. Personally, if I had to go with tretinoin I'd pick Ketrel.\n\n# Overall tazarotene vs tretinoin comparison:\n\nFor me tazarotene is an easy winner.\n\nTretinoin has been fantastic to me, it improved my fine lines and made some disappear, and also made some milia that had been there for a long time fall off, mostly the bigger ones. But at around the 10 months mark it stopped giving progress, and slowly the fine lines started growing again, although definitely at a slower rate than if I wasn't using tretinoin.\n\nIn less than a month after replacing it with tazarotene my fine lines started erasing and stubborn comedones started falling off too. My skin also was noticeably slightly tighter and the irritation was about 30% less than with tretinoin creams.\n\n# My reviews of each product (in order of testing):\n\n* **Stieva-A 0.025% cream**: first one I've used and it was dope. Like every cream based tretinoin in this list, no irritation upon application. It was a kinda liquidy cream, so I guess a lotion, which gave it amazing spreadability without being too liquid. It sort of acted like a moisturizer, and when I'd put some water on my face a few hours later it'd feel pretty nice. It caused good peeling and just the right amount of irritation for my skin to progressively get over until I could move to more potent tretinoins.\n* **Ketrel 0.05% cream**: Another fantastic one, it would give similar peeling as Stieva-A at first but definitely even better results. With continued use, my skin would actually eventually glow , and some milia that had been there for a over decade actually fell off. And when my hydration was on point, there wouldn't even be peeling. Similarly to the Stieva-A it also acted like a moisturizer, and some hours after application, like with most moisturizers for me, my skin would feel a bit tight (not big deal) and it would feel really nice when I'd apply water to it. No alcohol in that one, so no alcohol smell nor irritation upon applying.\n* **Tretiheal 0.1% cream**: It works, it's not fake, but.. the spreadability was bad, it left my skin greasy and very slightly more brown-yellow-ish, and wasn't as effective as ketrel despite having a higher concentration. It didn't give me the glow ketrel did.\n* **Tretin 0.025% cream USP**: I used that one for the body since tubes from India are cheap, I used to apply it at the end of each shower. It's a pretty thick cream so the spreadability isn't great and it's better to use smaller amounts at a time, applying with the fingertips. It takes about 10-15 min to apply to the whole body. It leaves my skin very slightly sticky but not in a bothering way, and seems to hydrate it REALLY well. Doesn't smell like alcohol, and although we don't have the full ingredients list there's no alcohol displayed in the preservatives. It's effective. No peeling in most areas so I think I could've started directly with at least 0.05% tretinoin, but I now plan to try tazarotene for the body and see how that goes instead. Back to tretin, the downsides are only some redness and a slight bit of irritation in the areas that rub a lot skin-on-skin between the legs for a day or 2, but that seems to slowly decrease over the months of use and I'm sure that it'd be fully prevented if I used an occlusive on those areas before applying the tretinoin.\n* **Menarini A-ret 0.1% gel**: Too much alcohol. Its strong smell doesn't stay on your face after applying but it's an indicator of how much alcohol there is in there. Surely because this relatively high quantity of alcohol, it hurt my the skin upon application, which I know to be a sign of skin damage.  I think it dissolved my skin barrier, which I'm sure increases the tretinoin's absorption, but also increases skin dryness and sensitivity. The alcohol ingredients present in this gel seem to be Methyl Hydroxybenzoate, Propyl Hydroxybenzoate, PEG-4 Olivate, and Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters. A-ret is the product that gave me by far the most peeling at once and the only one that made my forehead peel. It didn't cause irritation on the forehead though, so I could use it just for that area (I'll report back if I do). What I like about gels however is how quickly they disappear and leave your skin looking like you didn't apply anything at all.\n* **Tretiwell 0.1% gel USP**: This one was a lot better tolerated than A-ret because it didn't sting upon application. Just like A-ret or MyTret, it disappears very quickly and leaves the skin looking like nothing was applied. It does smell like alcohol although not as much as A-ret. It also leaves the skin a tiny bit sticky for 30 min but has amazing spreadability, even better than tazret's. I haven't directly (split face) compared it to Ketrel or MyTret, but it seems to cause similar amounts of peeling. It left the side of my neck that it was on a bit red, which likely would've worsened if I kept applying it frequently and eventually hurt, like MyTret did.\n* **MyTret 0.1% microsphere gel**: No irritation upon application and no smell of alcohol. In the following days, it caused less peeling or irritation than the gels (A-ret & Tretiwell) or Ketrel, but I don't think it's a fair comparison because the whole point of a microsphere gel is to decrease peeling and irritation thanks to a vehicle that offers a timed release for gradual delivery of the tretinoin, and supposedly to a slightly deeper skin level than creams. It still caused a bit of peeling. I guess that the only way to know whether it would actually work better would be to use it for 3 months and compare with one of these other tretinoin products. Most people online seem to say that the microsphere gel form of tretinoin has been a great game changer for them, although I've only read them using other brands. Supposedly the main benefits of lower peeling and irritation and more frequent applications and better skin barrier quality, which turns out not to be a benefit for me since after applying it a second time it dried my neck skin further and my sunscreen (I use the Canmake Mermaid Skin clear) was painful to apply. If I had to guess, I'd say that MyTret is still likely a bit less drying than Tretiwell. My conclusion is that MyTret is a product that can be great only if put on oily skin.\n* **Tazret Forte tazarotene 0.1% cream**: The peeling here lasted a day longer than with MyTret, which means that it reached deeper layers of the skin, meaning a better anti-aging effect and a more continuous effect. It offered about 30% less irritation than Ketrel, despite Ketrel being pretty low irritation for me to start with. What also surprised me is that my skin definitely seemed smoother and more hydrated, especially on my lips. It has a similar consistency to Stieva-A, which means amazing spreadability, and surprisingly kinda feels like a gel in the sense that it leaves no trace of use on your face shortly after. Like the other creams compared here, it doesn't smell like alcohol. The people I've seen happy with their tazarotene were on either tazorac or arazlo, so I was worried that this brand might not show the improvements over tretinoin that many talked about, but after a month of using it I confirm that my skin is better, with faded fine lines and removed milia that used to be stubborn. Tazarotene creams are also the only creams that make my forehead peel.\n* **Boderm Tazarene 0.1% cream**: Contains 0.1% of tazarotene but also potassium azeloyl diglycinate (azelaic derivative used to target hyperpigmentation, acne, & redness), as well as the moisturizing agents sodium hyaluronate and panthenol. The texture is very nice, especially for the face but maybe wouldn't have optimal spreadability on the body. It didn't smell like alcohol nor stinged my face (including eye skin) when applied. Unlike tazret, it's a small bit sticky, likely due to the hyaluronic acid, but not enough to be bothering, and the feeling decreases throughout the first hour. When compared to tazret, they both stopped peeling at the exact same time (twice) and caused the same peeling intensities at the same spots, and just like tazret it made some stubborn milia fall. The only difference I could notice was that a few days after application, when I'd rub both my eyes' skin, the one with tazret on it felt a tiny TINY bit more sensitive than the one with Tazarene.\n   * Update (2025/02/17): After applying Tazarene consecutively a few times a little close to one another, it caused me a bit of irritation and dryness, especially on my throat, which I suspect to be due to the cetearyl alcohol it contains since that same ingredient has also been problematic for me in other products. This means that I can't use Tazarene as frequently as Tazret (like, every 5 or 6 days instead of every 4 days), so I'm putting it under Tazret in the ranking.\n\n# Split face comparisons I've done (in chronological order):\n\nA split face comparison is when I put a product on one side of my face, neck, and forearms / hands, and another on the other half. My hands and forearms tolerated the retinoids without ever getting irritated (only some peeling inside the hands at the start), so these comparisons are more relevant for the face and neck.\n\nMost often I'd do the test a second time where I'd invert the sides to make sure the results are consistent and that I don't have a side that develops better resistance to retinoids than the other.\n\n* Ketrel 0.05% cream vs Tretiheal 0.1% cream\n* A-ret 0.1% gel vs Tretiwell 0.1% gel\n* Tazret forte 0.1% cream vs MyTret Microsphere gel 0.1%\n* Tazret forte 0.1% cream vs Ketrel 0.05% cream\n* Tazret forte 0.1% cream vs Tretiwell 0.1% gel\n* Tazarene 0.1% cream vs MyTret Microsphere gel 0.1%\n* Tazarene 0.1% cream vs Tazret forte 0.1% cream\n\n# \"What's so bad about using alcohol as a penetration enhancer? Don't we use glycolic acid for that too anyway?\"\n\nIdeally you shouldn't lose the oil that's on your skin because it hydrates and protects your skin from irritation and damage. Alcohol will always at least remove some of it and maybe all of it, while glycolic acid ideally only removes dead skin cells if used in the right amounts, which improves skin cell turnover and also enhances penetration but in a non-harmful way. Too much glycolic acid can also disrupt the skin barrier (your skin's surface oil), although it won't happen as immediately as alcohol.\n\n# Websites I've ordered from:\n\nLuckily none of the places I've ordered from were ever scams, even the ones that didn't ask for a prescription. I can't share all of them here because of the rules of this sub regarding prescription medication, but here are the ones I can share:\n\n* [Bestpharmacy.gr](https://bestpharmacy.gr/) \\- Tazarene isn't considered a prescription medication\n* [Felixforyou](https://www.felixforyou.ca/) \\- They deliver Stieva-A and some other models to you if you're in Canada, they have doctors who can make you the prescription\n* I bought Ketrel locally in [France](https://www.google.com/maps/place/France/) with a prescription\n\nDon't forget to wear your sunscreen outside to prevent skin damage if you pick any of these products!\n\nI might come back and edit this post if I ever test more retinoids.\n\nI'm obviously not paid by anybody to write any of this btw.\n\n# Mandelic acid bonus (2025/04/03 update):\n\nJust like with glycolic acid and likely other alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), mandelic acid improves the effects of retinoids.\n\n**I tested it alone**, the results were nice: smoother skin and no peeling, but not as good of an anti-wrinkling effect as tretinoin or tazarotene.\n\n**I tested it with tazarotene**, I got very impressed: serious decrease in peeling, much stronger wrinkle reduction effect than tazarotene alone. Putting mandelic acid on before tazarotene leads to a bit less peeling but also bit less reduction in wrinkle depth compared to putting tazarotene on first.\n\n**Comparison with other AHAs**: I've read someone mention that lactic acid had been the missing link for them to stop peeling on tretinoin, so I assume every AHA must offer this peeling reduction benefit. I chose to go with mandelic acid because I find it to offer the same exfoliation as leave-on glycolic and lactic acid products, especially when used consistently. The glycolic and lactic acid products also sting & irritate my skin too much, and I personally don't find any benefit to their humectant effect - it just makes them sticky, not hydrating.\n\nI've been using \"The Ordinary 10% Mandelic Acid + HA\", but likely any other mandelic acid products of the same concentration will work just fine. I haven't tried any other one yet so I can't compare.",

I just had an experiment that made me think the opposite, for 1 year I was using 0.05 tret, I have hooded eyes and I was putting tret on my eyelids and in couple of months I noticed huge a difference, my eyelids were lifted even higher than when I was at high school.. So I wanted to switch to 0.1 tret in order to get better results (especially with my crow's feet) so I ordered tretiheal online, and after using for 2 months, my lifted eyelids effect was gone! (without mentioning that I didn't experience any flaking or irritation). Which made me thing it doesnt work. I switched again to 0.05 tret that I get locally in my pharmacy and they were lifted again. Can you please tell me how you made sure that it works? Because I still have 4 tubes and I want to make sure before throwing them..",

Did you try the oily skin or dry skin version of the Boderm Tazarene? I have oily skin on my face but I'l don't have acne and I've never used prescription retinoids, which I know are drying, so I'm wondering if I really need to use the oily skin formula or if it would actually be better to use the dry skin formula, to provide extra moisture to counteract the drying side effects, esp since I've never used prescription retinoids so I don't know how my skin will react. Any thoughts? \n\n\n2. Do you dilute either the Boderm or Forte for your eye area with an eye cream, put eye cream on first, or just use it full strength and as the first layer, then apply eye cream over it? \n\n\n\n3. How long did it take for your order to arrive from bestpharmacy.gr ? And you mentioned Canada so I'm assuming you're in Canada? I'm in the US. \n\n\n\n4. You mentioned these helped with wrinkles, comedones and milia, but what about pigmentation? Was there one that helped reduce sun damage, freckles or other pigmentation, or is that not an issue you have? \n\n\nThanks for any help!",

The reason I'm posting a comment because I saw so many people say they won't because of the packaging, and I honestly don't mind the packaging. I know the tube packaging is more convenient but I think I won't mind using my fingers and wipe off extra product on the side of my eyes, because look at the ingredients. It's got ceramides and its spf 30. We can wash our hands you know, they don't have to be dirty or unhygienic. I apply all my skincare with my hands. We don't have applicators for everything. So why does lipbalm bother people so much? I have been using the cosrx lipbalm which also comes in a tub and I've honestly gotten used to this kind of packaging. At this price and these ingredients I would overlook the packaging. \n\nPlus these tubs are recyclable. I can reuse them to put other products, like facewash that remains inside the tube packaging which doesn't come out, instead of throwing away the tube I cut it off at the bottom and store the product in these tiny tubs, because there's honestly a week's worth of product that goes to waste, and it can't be left open because it will dry out. What would I do with the chapstick packaging, I'll just have to throw it out and it can't be reused. It just goes in the trash, and I doubt it ever gets to a  recycling facility in a small town like mine.",

(it contains cetearyl alcohol and c/c triglyceride which is the culprit but also so many other beneficial ingredients, including what they say is the correct ratio of ceramides and lipids or w/e, ie skinceuticals 2:4:2) honestly i might still repurchase when it's empty, because it doesn't cause problems when used sporadically.\n\n**allie chrono beauty gel UV EX** \\- this is the one formulated for both face and body, as the dedicated face one seems to never be in stock? i've bought previous iterations of allie gel and never loved them, just too shiny, this one is soooo close though! the high zinc oxide content gives it the perfect finish, starts out pretty dewy but settles into a natural finish. the zinc also leaves my skin a little more dry than usual at the end of the day. i just wish this was a tinted sunscreen and then it would be my HG, as it stands it leaves a white cast that doesn't really fade. would probably be fine if you have pink undertones but against my olive skin it's not a good look. i've just been wearing it for running errands, yardwork, hiking etc. it doesn't contain octinoxate which is really unusual, that filter is pretty irritating on my skin so worth a second look if you have sensitive skin too\n\n**imprefine skin barrier base** \\- this is an example of me being overly hopeful, lol. it is not intended to be a dedicated sunscreen, although i was hoping it might work as one. alas, it is too thick and white cast-y when applied liberally, but when used as a base as intended it gives a nice appearance to the skin. it's supposed to be beige tinted, more peach to my eye but it has the effect of evening out the skin tone a bit. if i was less lazy, i would layer this over a chemical-only sunscreen on days that i wanted a little extra protection (some ppl are adamant that zinc gives the best sun protection, idk if it's true though). gonna finish up the tube but won't repurchase.\n\n**kiss me mommy uv aqua milk** \\- this is my everyday sunscreen, perfect for lazy people because it works fine on bare, unmoisturized skin. it definitely isn't moisturizing, but not drying either. it sets fully and doesn't move around, but is pretty shiny. i calm down the shine with cezanne make keep base on my t-zone and then i'm pretty much set for the day. not having to use a second product would be preferable, but this is affordable and perfect except for the shine. it can feel a little irritating on recently exfoliated skin (and give me a pimple or two in that scenario) but otherwise very tolerable on my sensitive skin. have repurchased and will repurchase!\n\n**cezanne make keep base** \\- oops, forgot to include this in the pic. this is a god send if, like me, you found the perfect sunscreen but it's just too shiny. not much to say, it's alcohol and fragrance free and it mattifies where you apply it. expecting the bottle to last a good while, and will repurchase when it's empty.\n\n**chifure washable cold cream** \\- shout out to ratzilla, i have purchased so many products on your recommendation lol. unfortunately this one left me confused, she describes it as rinsing off easily and completely and that is just not my experience at all. trying to remove with water leaves a very noticeable waxy film on the skin, i don't even trust a second cleanser to remove it, so i remove with a washcloth. i throw it in my bag if i'm going on a short trip, i use it, remove with a cloth, and go straight to tretinoin once my skin is dry. won't repurchase though\n\n**urumina pure glow oshiroi uv milk** \\- ugh, i hate this lol. fragrance is too strong, pretty much impossible to apply the recommended amount of ss because it's too thick and pigmented. very white cast-y, very peachy/pink. it doesn't set and looks sweaty, if someone saw me wearing this they'd probably ask if i was ok, lol. i went for it because it's supposed to be all-in-one, moisturizer/ss/makeup (or at least even out skin tone enough to not need foundation) and was pretty popular on cosme at the time, don't even think i can finish it though! hate wasting product but i really might throw it in the trash.\n\nok that was a lot, hopefully this was helpful to someone who has had their eye on one of these products =) feel free to ask questions if you wanna know more about something",

    "body": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is me doing a comparative review once again. You can check out my comparative review for winter moisturisers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/kjuvbt/comparative_review_cetaphil_dam_vs_reequil/).\n\nThe title mentions a lot of moisturisers I know, but all of them have been used in the past one year or so. Summers are icky and choosing a moisturiser has become harder for me. Should I even use one when my skin is wetter and saltier than the Indian Ocean at the moment? idk friends, you tell me. When it is extremely humid and I am stepping out, I do not use a moisturiser. I use a hydrating toner (klairs supple) and sunscreen (I have reviewed all of them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/o9jpj9/sunscreen_comparative_review_neutrogena_innisfree/) )\n\n* *Skin Type:* Combination, oily at the T zone. At the moment, extremely oil at the T Zone, esp during high humidity days.\n* *Current climatic conditions:* Continental, hot and humid at the moment\n* *AGE:* 27 yo female\n* *Usage timeline:* More than a month for all the moisturisers except the FormulaRx one.\n\n1. **Neutrogran Hydroboost Gel:** I do not honestly recall what I was using before I began using this. It is a silicone rich light gel and spreads easily. The texture is light and it does not feel heavy on the skin, though it does not get fully absorbed either. When I used it last year, it seemed okay but did not impress me much. The fragrance was high, which further put me off of it. **I bought it for 800 bucks but I just checked and it now retails for a whooping 1000 bucks for 50gm on Nykaa**. That is honestly too much for this blue jar. I have also seen influencers raving about it calling it \"ocean in a jar\"....Sorry, have they seen the state of the oceans? It is all kachra these days. While the gel is neither ocean nor kachra, **I did not repurchase it and will not do so**, simply because it is way below the mark for me. However it did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Dimethicone/​Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-vinyl-dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Polyacrylamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyacrylamide), [Cetearyl Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-olivate), [Sorbitan Olivate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitan-olivate), [Dimethiconol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethiconol), [C13-14 Isoparaffin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c13-14-isoparaffin), [Dimethicone Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone-crosspolymer), [Chlorphenesin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/chlorphenesin), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Laureth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-7), [Sodium Hyaluronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hyaluronate), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [C12-14 Pareth -12](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-pareth-12), [Sodium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-hydroxide), [Blue 1](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-42090)\n\n**2. Simple Light Hydrating Moisturiser:** I got introduced to this moisturiser through this sub and I really like it! It is hydrating and occlusive as well. Its consistency is somewhere between a gel and a cream- but it is not as light as an emulsion, it is slightly leans towards the lotion side. I usually use it in months that are neither too hot, nor too cold. That is February, March and then September, October and November. In colder months, my skin remains dry despite using it and in hotter and humid months, this feels a little heavy for my combination skin. **I love it over all and it is definitely a no frills, value for money moisturiser, retailing for 430 bucks for 125ml on Nykaa. WRP.** Did not break me out.\n\n**Ingredient List:**\n\n[Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glycerin), [Paraffinum Liquidum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/paraffinum-liquidum), [Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyglyceryl-3-methylglucose-distearate), [Dimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/dimethicone), [Cetyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-palmitate), [Cetyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetyl-alcohol), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Caprylyl Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caprylyl-glycol), [Carbomer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/carbomer), [Potassium Hydroxide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-hydroxide), [Tocopheryl Acetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tocopheryl-acetate), [Bisabolol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bisabolol), [Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-c10-30-alkyl-acrylate-crosspolymer), [Disodium EDTA](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Pantolactone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pantolactone), [Borago Officinalis Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/borago-officinalis-seed-oil), [Potassium Carbonate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-carbonate), [Pentylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentylene-glycol), [Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/urea), [Lactic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/lactic-acid), [Sodium Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lactate), [Serine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/serine), [Sorbitol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sorbitol), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Allantoin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/allantoin)\n\n**3. Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All in One Gel-** This is the one I am using at the moment and it satisfies my currently very oily Tzone perfectly. It does feel a tad bit less for my cheeks but all the sweat makes for it lol ;\\_; . I tried the emulsion as well in the hopes of meeting all my needs but it feels sticky to me.It seems like I cannot have it all ;\\_;\n\nCompared to HydroBoost, this is way lighter! It is almost watery when applied on the skin.The ingredient list is impressive but I dont know if it has done anything extra special for my skin. It is good enough and that is perfectly satisfactory for me. I don't think it has any occlusives and it mainly just hydrates my skin. So i use it in my AM routine, and use the sunscreen over it. Hopefully that should trap all the moisture in, right? (insert Anakin and Padame meme). I love it and will buy it for summers, especially for the hot and humid months of May, June, July and August. I don't think it can satisfy my skin's needs in the other months. **It retails for 1200 bucks for 120 ml and is available only on Nykaa afaik. WRP.** Has not broken me out either.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water / Aqua / Eau, Propanediol, Panthenol, Silica, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Glyceryl Caprylate, Butylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Ethylhexylglycerin, Madecassoside, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol\n\n**4. The FormulaRx Barrier Relief Lightweight Gel Cream:** This is a new kid on the block and the company does not have a good reputation here and rightfully so. I did not want to buy from them but then I sold my soul and compromised my morals all because its emulsion like texture seemed exactly what I wanted and felt it would suit my skin. Sorry heavenly father, I will do better. That said, the texture really is all that. It has ceramides and what not (=niacinamide). The texture is exactly how the long ass name describes it as- a cream-gel, g(j)elly cream etc etc. Also I have only used it only for a week, during my PM routine so these are strictly my first impressions. It sinks in nicely, given you are able to take out the desired amount from the metallic tube. Because often, you wont be- it will squirt out way more than what you need, the packaging is aesthetic but really inconvenient. Even the tube arrived all dented and pichka hua. Overall it is a good moisturiser that I will perhaps continue to use in my PM but I have not yet made my mind whether I'll repurchase it or not. **It retails for 799 bucks for 50gm and I feel it could have been priced lower.**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nWater, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, niacinamide, propanediol, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, sodium hyaluronate, colloidal oatmeal, panthenol, allantoin, ceramide np, ceramide ap, ceramide eop, phytosphingosine, cholesterol, linoleic acid, sodium lauroyl lactylate, xanthan gum, butylene glycol, carbomer, tocopherol, phenoxyethanol, dimethicone, disodium edta, linolenic acid, ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nI hope these reviews are helpful! As always, these are my personal impressions and YMMV. So please take it with a pinch of salt. Additionally I have reviewed Disguise Cosmetic's C+C Sorbet [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/jyao20/disguise_cosmetics_cc_sorbet_review/).\n\nAnd yet,  [I still haven't found what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/e3-5YC_oHjE). I actually did find something that suited me through most months- the Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion. The texture and consistency are wonderful. Sinks in nicely. I don't feel dry or greasy. Moreover it brightens up my face. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I only had a sample size which got over pretty soon ;\\_; I have been tempted to buy the full size but guys, does it make sense to spend 4k on the full size of this emulsion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit(copying this from my comment below)**:  *Unfortunately today i woke with a painful zit. I do not get zits. So either it is because of the formularx moisturiser or the mangoes I am eating everyday. I guess karm ka phal ekdum mil gya.*\n\n It could be the ceramides because I have broken out a little because of them earlier too. Too soon to say it is this moisturiser. Will update here if I find anything conclusive.",

Also I don't buy the other products in expensive range because I am happy with how the ones I already own function",

        "body": "Alcohol (or Denatured Alcohol, or Ethanol) is a controversial ingredient in topical products. Some people say that alcohol applied to skin releases an inflammatory cascade of free radicals that persists long after the product has been applied. Additionally it can burn holes in your skin thereby destroying collagen and elastin in order to enhance penetration of active ingredients. Other people say that the overall formula of a product with alcohol could be hydrating, that it evaporates quickly without an effect and those holes that it burns eventually close up. People point out that the studies showing inflammatory effect of alcohol are concerned with oral consumption and studies researching antiseptics with high amounts of alcohol do not show a long-term harmful effect on the skin. Now cetearyl alcohol is a different type of alcohol. There are low molecular weight alcohols and high molecular weight alcohols also known as fatty alcohols. Cetearyl alcohol is a fatty alcohol and almost everyone in the skinfluencer world will tell you that fatty alcohols are very good emollients for the skin. However, there is also some information that shows the downsides to fatty alcohols. The reason why fatty alcohols might be damaging to the skin is because they can be present in the formulation acting as emulsifiers. Emulsifiers are needed to mix the oil and water phases of an emulsion together. The problem is that emulsifiers can attach themselves to the lipids on the skin cell membranes and wash them away with water which disturbs the integrity of the skin cells. It can be described in a way that emulsifiers \"drive the skin out\". Overall I think it is all down to formulation and if your skin feels fine then you could make a choice to continue using the product.",

They claim this item is worth $134 and it would be if it had the actual ingredients in it that the true product does. From the Avant website (where it is on sale for $87) these are the true ingredients:\n\nAllantoin, aqua (water), ascorbyl palmitate, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetearyl alcohol, cetearyl, glucoside, cetyl alcohol, chlorphenesin, CI 17200 (D&C Red No. 33), CI 42090 (FD&C Blu No. 1), citric acid, dimethicone, dimethicone crosspolymer, ethylhexyl, palmitate, ethylhexylglycerin, lecithin, maris aqua (sea water), ozokerite, parfum (fragrance), Persea gratissima (avocado) oil, phenoxyethanol, potassium cetyl phosphate, propylene glycol, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, sodium hyaluronate sodium polyacrylate, sorbitol stearyl alcohol, tocopherol, xanthan gum.\n\nThe first few on the BoxyCharm version in order are: Aqua (water), caprylic/capric triglyceride,ethylhexyl palmitate,cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone, sorbitol.......you get the picture\n\nSo from now on if you are a BoxyCharm customer I’d encourage you to check your ingredients against the manufacturers website to see if they are just giving you garbage to try to make it sound like you are getting an amazing deal.",

I used 2% sa from Paula's choice as a spot treatment before, and it's really good but it dried out my skin so much, this just works. I've even used this three times a day and it doesn't dry out my skin. This brings the pimple to a head so soon. I've been using this since Jan 27th and i placed the order on the cultbeauty website on 6th jan. I've gotten a lot of opportunity to use this as i get frequent hormonal acne. My skin is very sensitive, and this doesn't irritate my face at all. It's fragrance free. The price of this product is 591.18 rupees on cultbeauty and you get 15 ml of the product, which is very decent for a spot treatment. The texture is veryyy lightweight and it doesn't pill under sunscreens and absorbs very quickly. It is non greasy. The active ingredients are 1% salicylic acid and 2% sulphur and the hyaluronic acid (edit: and squalane) in it makes it non-drying i suppose. Btw don't worry, it does smell a little sulphury but it's not overpowering or noticeable. It's green out of the tube but doesn't leave a tint of any sort, it's invisible. I thought the green color was to help color correct any redness from acne, but it doesn't do that too.\n\nMy skin type: normal (sort of dry in the beginning of feb due to winters), acne prone and sensitive\n\nClimatic conditions: moderately humid (30% today)\nMy age: 18.5\n\nFull ingredients list: Water (Aqua/Eau), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Colloidal Sulfur, Glycerin, Succinic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Salicylic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Squalane, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dehydroacetic Acid, Malachite Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, CI 75810 (Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex).\n\nI use this after cleansing my face and before my moisturizer. I've used this on consecutive days too and no purging or irritation has occured. But please do patch test because everyone's skin is different. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite products ever and I'll definitely repurchase it and call it my holy grail product. I'd highly recommend it too.\n\nI think I've mentioned everything needed for a review but please mention anything that i have forgotten and feel free to ask any questions about this product.",

    "body": "I was on the search for the perfect fragrance free oil/balm cleanser for quite some time. I love to do double cleanse to make sure I remove all the sunscreen and makeup at the end of the day. Over the years, I have tried quite a few of first cleansers/cleansing balms so I thought I would do a quick review here for anyone who is interested. My standards when it comes to a good cleansing balm/oil: fragrance-free, effective, but gentle on the skin, doesn’t over-dry the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes. My skin is sensitive and acne-prone.\n\nAll the products I buy and review here completely fragrance free, contain no masking fragrance, no “natural” fragrances or essential oils, no photo-sensitizing, potentially irritating plant oil/extracts (lavender, eucalyptus, citrus). So here we go:\n\n**Versed Gentle Cycle Hydrating Milky Cleanser:**  **•**\n\n**Ingredients**: Water/Aqua/EauOlea Europaea (Olive) Fruit OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed OilPropanediolVitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed OilGlycerinCaprylic/Capric TriglycerideMusa Sapientum (Banana) ExtractMagnesium Aluminum SilicateLactobacillus Ferment LysateSclerocarya Birrea (Marula) Seed OilAvena Sativa (Oat) Kernel ExtractRubus Fruticosus (Blackberry) Fruit ExtractLeuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment FiltrateTocopherolCitric AcidSodium Lauroyl SarcosinateXanthan GumEthylhexylglycerinSodium BenzoatePotassium SorbateSodium Hydroxide\n\n**My thought:** This product has a milky texture that is easy to use, effective and also gentle on the skin and doesn’t sting my eyes, but there are a few things to note: 1/ It doesn’t spread very far on the skin so you have to use quite a lot of product to cover the entire face so the bottle doesn’t last very long. 2/Even though the product is fragrance free, there’s a light banana scent due to the banana extract in the formula. So if you’re not fond of the banana smell, you might not like it.  Overall, it’s a great , gentle formula and one that I might repurchase.\n\n**Updated review (11/10/22): I recently repurchased this product again and noticed there are little grainy particles like sand in the product. I'm not sure what they did to the product but my sensitive skin can't tolerate scrubs or any physical exfoliant so I won't be using or repurchase this product again.**\n\n**Good Molecule Instant Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Polyethylene, PEG-8 Isostearate, 1,2-hexanediol, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate, Camellia Oleifera Seed Oil, Caprylic/capric Triglyceride, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Citric Acid.\n\n**My thought:** This product used to be only available in the scented version (loaded with potentially irritating essential oils), but due to customer demand, they decided to make a fragrance free version (thank you very much). I’m not sure if the scented version is still out there, so make sure you check the ingredients carefully before purchasing. This product come in a tub with a small spatula that you can use to scoop up the product. I do like this cleansing balm, I think it’s very effective and a little goes a long way. You don’t need to use much to cleanse the entire face. It’s also gentle enough to use around my eyes without any irritation. One con I can think of about this product is the smell. Even though it’s fragrance free, it has a chemical smell that is quite strong which I guess comes from one of the raw ingredients in the formula (though I’m not sure which one exactly). I think some people might find it unpleasant, but it’s still better than adding fragrance or essential oils.\n\n**The Ordinary Squalene Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Squalane, Aqua (Water), Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Glycerin, Sucrose Stearate, Ethyl Macadamiate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Sucrose Laurate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Isoceteth-20, Sodium Polyacrylate, Tocopherol, Hydroxymethoxyphenyl Decanone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Malic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chlorphenesin.\n\n**My thought:** This product has a cream texture that is quite thick coming out of the tube, and once it’s on the skin, it does require a lot of massaging, then the texture changes to oil as you work it in. Even though it’s gentle on the skin, I find it a lot less effective than other products on this list. This is not a product I would recommend for someone that wears a lot of makeup or doesn’t like to take a long time removing makeup at the end of the day. Even if you don’t wear a lot of makeup, I think there are better products out there. Personally, I wouldn’t repurchase it because: 1/It requires too much rubbing and effort to make it work. 2/I find it does irritate my eyes a little. 3/you have to use a lot of product to cleanse the entire face and the tube doesn’t last very long.\n\n**The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Oil, Candelilla Cera (Cire de candelilla), Silica,Sorbitan Stearate, Tribehenin, PEG-60 Almond Glycerides, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Aqua (Water/Eau), Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil.\n\n**My thought:** This product comes in a tube, similar to the packaging of the ordinary squalene cleanser, but the texture is different. It comes out of the tube like petrolatum jelly. Because it’s quite thick, it doesn’t spread very far, so you have to use quite a lot of product to cleanse the entire face. It’s gentle on the skin and eyes, and leave my skin very soft afterward, but I think it will not work well for someone that wear a lot of makeup. I consider myself a minimal makeup wearer and this product couldn’t remove my eyeshadow completely. I also notice that the texture of the cleanser is not completely smooth, it’s slightly grainy due to the small pieces of oat which I do not like. I will not be repurchasing this product.\n\n**Jordan Samuel Skin The After Show Treatment Cleanser for Sensitive Skin:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycerin, Aqua/Water, Sucrose Laurate, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobiliss Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**My thought:** This has to be the worse balm cleanser I have ever tried. It has a jelly-like texture coming out of the tube, and it goes on the skin just fine, but it just doesn’t cleanse off when I rinse my face with water. It barely remove makeup and leaves my face with a layer of residue that feels oily. I feel like I have to follow up with another cleanser right away or risk breaking out. I hate wasting product but I couldn’t make myself use this one so I threw it out after trying a few times. Sadly, I cannot recommend this product to anyone.\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Triethylhexanoin, Sorbeth-30 Tetraisostearate, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olive Fruit Oil, Water, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate(Super Hyaluronic Acid), Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate (Skin-adsorbed Hyaluronic Acid), Jojoba Seed Oil, Ceresin, Dextrin Palmitate/Ethylhexanoate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, BHT\n\n**My thought:** this product is a very popular Japanese cleansing oil, and for a good reason. It’s affordable, cleanses quickly and effectively, without leaving any residue behind. 2 pumps are what needed to cleanse my entire face. If you’re someone that wear a lot of makeup and need something that can remove make up fast and effortlessly, you will love this product. Some cons about this product: 1/ it can bother my eyes sometimes if I get it too close to the eyes. I thought i just throw this out there in case anyone has super sensitive eyes. 2/ It might be hard to get in in store. You have to order it online and it might take some time to arrive.\n\n**Isnt Tree Micellar Melting Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Acer Saccharum (Sugar Maple) Sap , Opuntia Ficus-Indica Seed Oil , Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Squalane\n\n**My thought:** This is a liquidy cleansing oil that comes in a pump bottle. It’s thin in texture and gentle, but effective. It’s also non irritating to the eyes, and rinses off well. Compare to the hada labo, it’s a thinner oil, and I have to use more product than Hada Labo to cleanse my entire face. I need 3 pumps for Isnt Tree as opposed to only 2 pumps for Hada Labo. If you are deciding between the 2, I would recommend Hada Labo. It’s just as effective if not more, the bottle lasts longer, and more cost effective as well.\n\n**Purito from Green Cleansing Oil:**\n\n**Ingredients:** Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Glyceryl Caprylate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Vegetable Oil, Tocopherol\n\n**My thought:** This oil cleanser come in a pump bottle similar to the ones from Hada Labo and Isnt Tree, but the texture is thicker than the other 2 brands. It’s effective, but gentle and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I need about 3 pumps to cleanse my entire face. Overall, it’s a good cleanser but I still prefer the Hada Labo because it’s cheaper, works just as well, and the bottle lasts longer.\n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm:**\n\n**Ingredients**: Ethylhexyl Palmitate (emollient solvent), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (skin-replenishing), PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate (emollient cleansing agent), Diisooctyl Succinate (emollient), Olive Oil PEG-7 Esters (emollient cleansing agent/emulsifier), Trihydroxystearin (texture enhancer), Glyceryl Stearate (emulsifier), Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Hydrogenated Rapeseed Oil (non-fragrant antioxidant/skin-softening omega fatty acid), Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E/antioxidant).\n\n**My thought:** This one has a balm like texture coming out of the tube and spread easily on the skin. There’s no residue left behind after cleansing. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn’t sting my eyes and is also effective. It has no discernible smell, which is nice since some fragrance-free products can still have an unpleasant smell due to the raw ingredients used in the formula.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Ingredients:** Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-10 Isostearate, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Seed Water, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Water, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glycerin, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**My thought:** This is the most recent product that I've tried and is my current favorite. If I have to choose only 1 balm/oil cleanser to use, this would be the one. It replaces my previous favorite cleansing balm from Paula's Choice. The texture is smooth and gentle on the skin. It spreads more easily than Paula's Choice's and has no detectable scent. \n\n**Other plain oil options I’ve tried that work well:** When I run out of my balm cleanser and haven’t purchased a replacement in time. I usually use plain oils to remove my makeup. But because plain oils do not contain emulsifier, they don’t come off with water, so I have to immediately follow up with a water based cleanser to rinse off the oil residue on my face. Here are 2 oils that I like to use:\n\n**Coconut oil**: thicker oil, best for people with normal to dry skin\n\n**Jojoba Oil:** thinner in texture than coconut oil, best for oily and combo skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Top 3:** \n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm** \n\n**Paula’s Choice Omega + Complex Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Hada Labo Gokujun Oil Cleanser**\n\nIf you have a favorite oil/balm cleansers that are not on this list, please share with me in the comment :)\n\n&#x200B;",

        "body": "This is so cool! I love seeing people as committed to zero fragrance/irritants as I am! I'm definitely going to keep these in mind for reccing balms in the future since I don't usually mess with those.\n\nFor context, I'm dry skin and sensitive + acne prone, plus have keratosis pilaris. A cleansing oil I would highly suggest to try out is\n\nKOSE SPEEDY cleansing oil. Here is the current ingredient list https://incidecoder.com/products/kose-speedy-cleansing-oil\n\n you'll see a lot of different listings since they reformulated a lot but this is the right one. \nIt is a very light, well emulsified oil that rinses cleanly and doesn't overstrip. Spreads very well. Doesn't leave a residue. It is even good as a solo cleanse! This is my default recc for any skin type or with any condition. I have people with rosacea, eczema, and ichthyosis using it so I'm very confident in its gentleness. In the US, there's 1pack 7.8oz for $13 or 2pack with 1 full and 1 refill for $20 on Amazon. Some have mentioned being able to find it at Daiso stores in US and other countries. \n\nSo this second one I've only used for a week but I begrudgingly have been pretty into it as I'm more on the dry side. It's the Neutrogena lightweight body oil fragrance-free https://www.neutrogena.com/products/skincare/body-oil-fragrance-free/6861830.html\n\nIt's a very low-viscosity watery-freling oil and it has good spreadability. Works really well at getting into pore for that deep but gentle clean you want from oils. It's probably the gentlest one I've tried even more so than my DIY sunflower/grapeseed + Polysorbate 80 I've made. The \"problem\" is that the Neutrogena oil does not rinse well at all. However I think it might good alternative for people who have tried other oil cleanser and found the emulsifiers just made it too much for their skin but don't want to use a pure oil. It does mostly come off with the gentle second cleanse. It will leave a bit behind in your skin, but as someone dry I quite appreciate that slight buffer for the cleanser and it hasn't caused any issues or broken me out. My skin does actually feel quite a bit more comfortable and less dry since introducing this when this was the only change. It does feel decently nourishing without being overwhelming. It definitrly lives up to its claims if used this way. Normal price is $13 for 8.5oz but can be found for $9-10 on sale sometimes. I'm still not sure how I feel about it but my skin has already decided it likes this, so... 😒\n\nAs my gentle water-based cleanser, my current favorite is the Pipette baby wash and shampoo fragrance-free https://www.target.com/p/pipette-baby-shampoo-wash-fragrance-free-11-8-fl-oz/-/A-79503241. I get a lot of funny looks when I recc this but it's genuinely the best thing I've found that is on par in gentleness with some of the better non-foaming cleansers like the Aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser and is more affordable. It has amazing spreadability and you don't need a lot. I have gone through 4 bottles and am about to repurchase because I'm too hooked and it's insanely cost effective compared to most facial cleansers. Normal price is $8 for 12oz, it's commonly on sale for $6.50ish and one time I caught it for $4 so I stocked up hard. But I'd be happy paying $8. I also use it for body and hair so 😳 I felt it was worth mentioning since it's the second cleanse I follow with.\n\nI'm definitely gonna be taking a look at more of your content now as well!

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nI wanted to create a space to discuss the new reformulation of Stratia's Interface moisturizer, and how it compares to Drunk Elephant's Protini. The new Stratia formula seems quite similar to Protini, at a much lower price point. It launched last week, so I imagine most people haven't been able to try it out yet, but if you have - please share your experiences as well! There's a lot of good info about the new formula on Stratia's Instagram but I'll recap some of it here.\n\n**Ingredient lists (Peptides/Growth Factors are in bold):**\n\n* Stratia Interface (Old Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, **Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-27, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide-78, Palmitoyl Octapeptide-24, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Lactic Acid/​Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Stratia Interface (New Formula): Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Squalane, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Panthenol, Ethoxydiglycol, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Dimethicone, Rosa Mosqueta (Rose) Hip Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, **Sh-Oligopeptide-1, Sh-Oligopeptide-2, Sh-Polypeptide-1, Sh-Polypeptide-9, Sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate**, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Allantoin, Bacillus/Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, Polyacrylamide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Tocopherol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Laureth-7, Diazolidinyl Urea, Xanthan Gum\n* Drunk Elephant Protini: Water/Aqua/Eau, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Bacillus/ Folic Acid Ferment Filtrate Extract, Nymphaea Alba Root Extract, **sh-Oligopeptide-1, sh-Oligopeptide-2, sh-Polypeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-9, sh-Polypeptide-11, Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14, Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Valine, Acetyl Glutamine, Coconut Alkanes, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aspartic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, PCA, Sorbitan Isostearate, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Polysorbate 60, Lactic Acid/Glycolic Acid Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Isomalt, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenylpropanol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Symphytum Officinale Callus Culture Extract.\n\n**General info + thoughts I have on comparisons between the two:**\n\n* Stratia reformulated Interface because some of the peptides in the old formulation were discontinued. According to their IG, they used this as an opportunity to upgrade the formula and have now incorporated a different mix of peptides and have also added growth factors (the ingredients that start with Sh-). This makes the formula quite similar to Protini, at a lower price point.\n* Comparisons:\n   * The two formulas now contain the same mix of growth factors, as well as Copper Palmitoyl Heptapeptide-14 and Heptapeptide-15 Palmitate. The main difference now between the two formulas is that Protini contains Matrixyl 3000 (Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 and Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7), while Interface doesn't. Protini also has a diverse mix of amino acids in their formula (alanine, arginine, glycine, etc), while Interface does not.\n   * Stratia mentions that their peptides are \"encapsulated,\" which allows the Interface formula to be used alongside other actives (like Vit C, retinoids, acids, etc). Traditionally, from what I've read, peptides are finicky and work best on their own while not being used with other actives. Stratia says that their encapsulation technology allows Interface to be used at any time, and with any active. Protini does not claim any sort of encapsulation (to my knowledge).\n* I haven't tried the new Interface formula, but I have tried the old Interface formula as well as Protini. On IG, Stratia said that the new Interface formula texture should feel exactly like the old one, just with improved long-term benefits. Formula-wise, the old Interface feels a bit more lightweight than Protini. Neither are heavy-duty moisturizers and if you have dry skin, you may need to layer an oil or something heavier duty on top at night. In terms of differences in my skin - peptides/growth factors are more of a long-game, and in my experience, don't produce quick improvements in my skin that I can notice (like with AHAs or retinoids, for example). I use peptides because of their long-term benefits for the skin.\n\n**Questions I have:**\n\n* I'm wondering how much of an impact the \"encapsulation\" technology in Interface will truly make a difference in terms of it being able to be used with other actives - I'm not a product formulator so I'm not sure about the science behind this. At the moment, I avoid using peptides with any other active (I use them on nights when I'm taking a break from tret or acids). If the peptides in Interface truly are protected and can be used with actives (as Stratia claims on its website), then it truly is a game changer in terms of simplifying ones routine. Does anyone have more insight about encapsulation? Can peptides truly be \"protected\" from other actives?\n* Does the addition of amino acids in the Protini formula make a difference for anti-aging benefits?\n* Does anyone have experiences with the new Interface formula? Please share! :)\n\nFeel free to add any thoughts / info about these two products! Thanks everyone!",

I also decided on Zeroid and Ceramol over other brands because they do not contain fragrance or essential oils.\n\n* Skin type dry\n* Weather: 30 F to 50 F\n* Testing schedule: 3 weeks\n\n**Skin Concerns**: Looking for a moisturizer that can help my already dry skin handle the drying effects of daily 0.05 tretinoin unbuffered this winter. My skin used to be painfully tight right after washing and I couldn’t handle not applying a toner right away while doing the 30 minute wait for tretinoin. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Propanediol, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Glycerin, Squalane, Cetearyl alcohol, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Glyceryl stearate, Stearic acid, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Canola oil, Olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil, Cetyl palmitate, Sorbitan palmitate, Sorbitan olivate, Bisabolol, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Xanthan gum, Sodium hyaluronate, Carbomer, Arginine, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: rich moisturizer that falls somewhere between medium and heavy. \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Applies and spreads very smoothly. My dry skin sucks it ups and it leaves a slightly greasy feeling for a while. It eventually absorbs completely after a few minutes. Oily skin type won’t like it but dry skin type will most likely enjoy this cream. I like it enough to consider a repurchase for summer. \n\n**Zeroid Intensive Oint-Cream**\n\nWater/Aqua, Theobroma cacao (Cocoa) seed butter, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cetearyl alcohol, Cocoglycerides, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Polyglyceryl-10 distearate, Sorbitan stearate, Panthenol, Glyceryl stearate, Squalane, Stearic acid, Camellia oleifera seed oil, Caprylyl methicone, Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phytosterols, Tocopheryl acetate, Myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA, Euphorbia cerifera (Candelilla) wax, Zinc gluconate, Methyl caprooyl tyrosinate, Tetracarboxymethyl palmitoyl dipeptide-12, Xanthan gum, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Caprylyl glycol\n\n* Texture: super thick moisturizer that is definitely heavy but isn’t occlusive enough for me \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: Take a bit to squeeze it out of the tube as it is thick. Even so, it spreads very smoothly. It takes my skin much longer to drink it up and is definitely greasier but not oily. Due to how long it takes to dry down, I use it at night.  Oily skin type should avoid this like the plague but desert dry skin type will enjoy the richness. Definitely my go to for night time winter moisturizer.  \n\n**Ceramol 311 Crema**\n\nWater, Shea butter, Petrolatum, Penethylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/capric triglyceride, Batyl alcohol, Stearic Acid, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol, Arginine, Carbomer, Lecithin.\n\n* Texture: I can’t decide how to classify this cream. It squeezes out of the tube so easily, applies like a light lotion yet it is the farthest thing from light. It is firm enough that the squeezed ”cream” holds its shape. It is a translucent white, unlike the clearly white non-tranlucent Zeroid. It reminds me of a gel but it’s definitely not a gel.  \n* Smell: None that I can detect.\n* Experience: The texture is incredibly deceiving as it looks and feels light upon application but it really isn’t. I think it feels that way because it dries down matte. I enjoy using this in the morning because I don’t need to wait long for it to dry down before applying sunscreen. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nI like all 3 for different reasons. I was originally underwhelmed because my skin still felt dry halfway through the day. I want to test these properly so I continued using them. Since many are curious as to the performance and effects of Zeroid, I decided to do my review write up a week early (3 weeks versus 1 full month of testing). Note that these creams are NOT fungal acne safe.  \n\nI think these creams strengthened my moisture barrier. In fact, I stopped using an occlusive at night last week except on my eyelids and at the corners of my mouth, whereas I had to slather Eucerin all over my face for months. I don’t have any flakes or patches of peeling skin anymore compared to before I started these creams. My skin also doesn’t look tight or dry the next morning. \n\nTesting after I have finished the current tubes:\n\n* Zeroid Richenic Cream Urea 5% (haven’t opened)\n* Zeroid Intensive Hydrating Ampoule (haven’t opened)\n* Ceramol 311 Lipocream (seller sent me samples, haven’t opened)\n\nI have also tried La Mer, Nivea Mexico and Nivea Germany and will do a write up comparison on SCA when I can cough up the energy.",

CANNOT. WAIT. FOR. UREA 5% RICHENIC CREAM REVIEW. Oh, I didn't know they had an ampoule!! The ingredient list is so short! This will be interesting. Oooh, want to see how they measure up to the famous La Mer.",
