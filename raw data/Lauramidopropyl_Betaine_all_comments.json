The ingredients look good, although it's unfortunate that essential oils were included in the toner. The price point is about right for me as well - I always wanted to try Charlotte Cho's Then I Met You brand but it's a little outside of my normal budget range so I wonder how these products will compare. I personally ordered the cleanser and moisturizer!",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

The company prides itself on having all aspects of production based in the US. From manufacturing from the chemist to the designers to the tube manufacturers, the product is 100% made in the U.S.A. Helmsman can be purchased direct from their site or on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/](https://www.amazon.com/Helmsman-Mens-Shaving-Cream-Irritation/dp/B074W272LB/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman Original Scent is a light, refreshing scent that smell similar to many modern mens soaps and grooming products. This pleasant scent is hard to distinguish individual notes from. In general it is refreshing, clean and crisp. This scent is a nice divergence from complex scents and as such, Mrs. Ruds is neutral on this one. She cannot really smell it once I rinse it away, making it a great user if you want your post shave product or fragrance of the day to dominate. Scent strength is light to mid out of the container and remains that way through the shave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHelmsman brushless shave cream appears to be a vega based cream. Ingredients are listed as: Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Purified Water, Stearic Acid, Sodium Methyl, Cocoyl Taurate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Decyl Glucoside, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Hamamelis Virginiana, Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Siloxanetriol Alginate, Caffeine, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Boswellia Carterii Resin Extract, Silybum Marianum Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract, Calophyllum Tacamahaca Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Fruit Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Oleic Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Ceramide, Sodium Chloride and Citric Acid. Being a brushless cream, this cream can be applied with your hand or a brush but does not require water. Primary and residual slickness are good. I am able to buff without visible lather with no fear of the razor skipping or dragging. Post shave is also good. I am not left dry or tight once rinsed away. The ShaveScore for Helmsman Shave Cream is an 82. For similar performance I suggest you check out: Castle Forbes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Helmsman Shave Cream (promotional gift)\n* Brush - N/A\n* Razor - Rockwell 6S (purchased)\n* Post - Aqua Velva (purchased)",

Some products will offer a slight uptick of hydration, others may provide a nice softening effect. But for the most part, I have found most of the cleansers I have used to fall into two simple categories...low pH and high pH (the latter being something I avoid). That‚Äôs really what I look for over anything else.\n\nOf course, there have been cleansers that have stood out to me by offering a bit more. My first love was the D‚ÄôAlba Pidemont Peptide No-Sebum Cleanser which helped clear excess oil and sebum (it was my 2018 pick of the year). Others from brands like Peach & Lily, Solved Skincare, Make P:rem, and Rovectin helped to soothe my skin. And a few others just smelled good LOL. Glow Recipe, Sulwhasoo, and The Lotus offer products that added a sensorial experience to my cleansing step.\n\nThe Soko Glam Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser takes some of the qualities I mentioned above and takes things a step further.\n\nThis cream/gel hybrid cleanser impressed me pretty much from the initial application. The consistency is similar to other thick ‚Äústicky style‚Äù cleansers like the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel and the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser. But, there is a visible cloudy/creamy-ness to this product that makes it look a bit more intriguing.\n\nOne of the featured ingredients here is Green Tea Leaf Powder...which I love in the Inward Agas ACue Herbal Mask. Here though, they aren‚Äôt as concentrated and really just offer a pleasant appearance (at least for me).\n\nOther ingredients in the A New Leaf Cream Cleanser include Mugwort Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Celery Stem Extract.\n\nAside from the look of this product...the feel is even more impressive. Honestly, the thick/rich later that can be had from this cleanser is awesome. It‚Äôs been rare (in my experience) to get a foam so dense from a pH balanced product. Few others I have used make this happen but it‚Äôs a lovely surprise when it does.\n\nI had no issue taking my time massaging the lovely lather in...sometimes bringing the product down to my neck/chest just to enjoy the experience. A little bit goes a really long way here though. The smallest dollop/pea sized amount is sufficient for the whole face.\n\nOnce rinsed, the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser leaves behind thoroughly cleansed skin...without being at all stripping. The lack of fragrance gives this product a ‚Äúplain soap‚Äù scent that had me worried about the cleanser‚Äôs intensity...but that turned out to be a non-issue.\n\nIn addition to general cleansing, this product also delivered on its ability to calm/soothe the skin. The relatively high concentration of mugwort...while only on the skin for a short time...seems to pull through and reduce redness/irritation. Because of this, I found myself feeling comfortable in grabbing this product for not only my AM and PM routine...but also as a stand in for cleansing wipes after a workout or day spent hiking.¬†\n\nAfter just about a month with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I am left feeling super impressed. To me, I see the Good Skin Days line as an excellent entry point into not only Soko Glam but K-Beauty in general (I‚Äôll have my review for the moisturizer out very soon). The Prime Time Cleansing Toner wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea...but I know others will love it (some have already professed their love on the Soko Glam site).\n\nThis cleanser totally plays into that by offering a gentle/approachable use, awesomely dense lather, and a pretty great value. I am kind of a cleanser junkie so I‚Äôll be continuing to test other products...but the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser will be making it into several christmas gift bags for friends and family!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Glycerin, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Acrylates Copolymer, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Stem Extract, Coptis Japonica Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf Extract, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Citric Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $16.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser](https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser) \n\nPS: I have been incorporating the Foreo Luna 3 into my routine for a little over a week, and I want to include a little blurb at the end of each cleanser review to talk about how they played together. As for the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...it‚Äôs not something I would use with the Foreo.\n\nThe little bits of green tea (while pleasing to look at and have on the skin) tend to get caught in the little silicone touch points of the Foreo. I found myself taking just as much time picking/rinsing out the little pieces as I did actually cleansing my face lol! It ended up being kind of a hassle to the point that I set my Foreo aside for the last few days of this review.\n\nNow that I have finished my ‚Äútesting time‚Äù with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I will be using what I have left to either decant into smaller bottles for friends or just as a body wash. I really want to bring the Foreo back into the fold and for that to happen I‚Äôll need to switch to a different product. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oct7ps65u9j51.jpg?width=5472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b996a5e309d78985bea879ea4ac020333c26410",

    "body": "Hey y'all; I've been using a facewash called 'The Vegan Glow Mild Foaming Cleanser' for about two years now. I have chronic topical allergies which means extremely sensitive skin, and to date this is the ONLY cleanser that hasn't irritated it, provoked acne and/or dried out my face. \n\nSadly it appears that it's no longer being sold; the only trustworthy looking website carrying it and shipping to the U.S is for some reason not accepting orders. And the company's website has vanished from the internet. \n\nI'm DEVASTATED. I need a new cleanser ASAP. So far I've discovered that my skin hates any kind of alcohol, sodium chloride, any fragrances, and any weird essential oils. Typically if a product has a long ingredients list.. it's going to upset my skin. \n\nThe ingredients in my original cleanser were as follows: \n\nWater, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Illicium Verum (Anise) Fruit Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\nIt also had a perfect 5.5 PH value. I tried Native's vegan alcohol free cleanser but the PH must've been off because it immediately made my skin oily. I also looked into Vanicream but saw people saying that the PH is in the 6-7 range, a range I have had a bad experience with :( Plus both of those contain sodium chloride.. \n\nIf anyone can help me find a dupe or something similar to TVG's I greatly appreciate it! Since no longer being able to buy it, my skin has rapidly deteriorated..",

        "body": "I also have severely sensitive skin. I wanted to share a tool I've been using to find dupe products or products without ingredients that are troublesome for me.  \n\nINCI Decoder: https://incidecoder.com/  \n\nHow to use:  \n\n1. Leave the search box blank (in order to capture all cleansers, since they could be named \"cleanser,\" \"wash,\" or even creative names like \"Swipe Clean\" (by Bybi)). Just click the magnifying glass.  \n\n2. Under \"Must Contain All Of These Ingredients,\" type the names of your favorite products' ingredients and select them from the autocomplete window.  \n\n3. Under \"Must Not Contain Any Of These Ingredients,\" enter any ingredients that you don't want.  \n\n4. Click \"Filter\" and you will get a list of matching products, sometimes spanning multiple pages.  \n\n5. Sometimes nothing matches the exact ingredients list you provided. To loosen the filters, click on the \"X\" next to any ingredients in the \"Must Contain\" box.  \n\nI've been using this tool for years. And even though I still struggle with cleansers, INCI Decoder has helped me find niche ingredient products that I otherwise would never have found on Google. A lot of them end up being from Canada or Europe, like Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands. I repeatedly find vegan and cruelty free as well as fragrance free and so-called hypoallergenic products from those countries. Again, products that my English Google searches likely would have missed. So it's an amazing tool. But the database only has products entered by users.  \n\nI went ahead and searched for a cleanser fitting some of your criteria:  \n\nErhalogy (or Erha21) Skin Barrier Facial Wash (I substituted cocamidopropyl betaine for lauramidopropyl betaine)  \n \nEtude House Cica Balance 5.5 Foam Cleanser (lacks a few thickeners and humectants from the Vegan Glow cleanser)\n\nRael Daily Detox Oil to Foam Gentle Cleanser (has olive oil and quite a few plant extracts, which might not be desired)  \n\nYou can also make the following substitutions of similar ingredients:  \n-lauramidopropyl betaine: cocamidopropyl betaine, coco-betaine  \n-decyl glucoside: coco glucoside, lauryl glucoside, caprylyl/capryl glucoside  \n-1,2-hexanediol: propylene glycol, propanediol, caprylyl glycol, pentylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol  \n-sodium cocoyl isethionate: sodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium cocoyl methyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, sodium cocoyl sarcosinate  \n\n\nGood luck and hope you find a dupe cleanser!  \n\nETA: I'm unfamiliar with the products mentioned above, so their vegan and cruelty free status needs to be confirmed with the vendor. Beyond the vendor I would also check Cruelty Free Kitty's database. Some companies lie about or use ambiguous language to claim that they don't test on animals (but then still do in countries like China, for example). Cruelty Free Kitty audits companies for truly cruelty free practices.",

Slow healing Generally have some clogged pores/comedones plus a couple hormonal nodules every month. Usually some ongoing PIH+PIE (red-brown acne marks) from that.\n\nAllergic/reactive to strongly fragranced skincare, shea butter, MCI/MI (a relatively uncommon preservative). Mineral oil and lanolin suit my skin a lot better than plant oils.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Climate:** Mumbai. Hot and humid summers.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Current routine:**\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è AM: \n+ Acne Squad Kick-Start Cleanser\n+ DIY vitamin c serum ([details here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/eIi64ptr8k)) with glycerin and green tea extract added in to make it hydrating\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream [(review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/QCyo55E2rI) with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder (I skip the powder if wearing sunscreen, otherwise it causes pilling)\n+ Vilvah Melt-in-Milk SPF30 ([review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/hIPvg9vFiC)) if facing windows indoors or stepping out briefly, Vilvah SPF50 if spending time outdoors. Skip if entirely indoors.\n\nüåô PM: \n+ DIY cleansing balm (if wearing makeup)\n+ Simple Refreshing Face Wash\n+ Minimalist AHA BHA 10% exfoliator OR Minimalist 3% Tranexamic Acid Face Serum (or a skip day if I feel my skin needs it)\n+ Dermadew Aloe cream with a pinch of Purenso Colloidal Oatmeal powder mixed in (also over the lips)\n+ 100% lanolin as an occlusive balm - dabbed on the lips, healing acne spots, and (if sleeping in AC or feeling like my skin is sensitised) a thin overall layer by rubbing between the palms and gently pressing all over the face.\n\nNote that I built up to this routine of actives by introducing them one at a time, over the course of several weeks.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Age:** Early 30s\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Usage timeline:** just under a month, every morning.\n\nThe brand directs you to use it daily, AM/PM, which is a bit confusing - does that mean twice a day? ü§î\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èIngredient list: \n\nWater, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Sodium chloride, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Acrylates Copolymer, Decyl Glucoside, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Coconut Acid, Fragrance, Terpineol, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-6, Citric Acid, Salicylic Acid, PEG-150 Distearate, Thymol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylhydroxytoluene, Sodium hydroxide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Saccharide Isomerate, Linalool.\n\nNotably, contains an unspecified percentage of salicylic acid (looks like 0.5% if we speculate that phenoxyethanol is 1% and the ingredients are in decreasing order) and what they call their \"patented Thymol T Essence‚Ñ¢\" which is a botanical extract that has antimicrobial properties.\n\nIs sulphate- and paraben-free, does contain fragrance, linalool, terpineol and thymol as potentially sensitising ingredients.\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Claims and expectations:**\n\n>A gentle, sulphate-free cleanser created with Thymol T Essence‚Ñ¢ & Salicylic Acid, clinically proven to reduce acne causing bacteria & soothe acne in 3 days. Restores moisture leaving skin hydrated with Pentavitin‚Ñ¢ molecules.\n\nThe \"soothing acne\" and whole Acne Squad approach with their stages of acne was what got me interested, because yeah, when you're acne-prone it's a cycle that is naturally always ongoing. That seemed realistic to me, I appreciate that. I had been using a 2% salicylic cleanser in the daytime (Zitcare foaming face wash) and was curious to see if a cleanser with less salicylic that had a different antimicrobial action would be more effective and maybe work better for my sensitive skin? \n\nThis proved to not be the case üôÉ\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Price:** MRP ‚Çπ325 for 100ml (always available at reduced price of under 300)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èTexture, consistency and fragrance\n\nThe texture is like most other foaming cleansers that come in a tube, but not super thick. It's a clear gel that makes a soft and fine foam when rubbed between damp hands. Does not lather a lot, but enough to satisfy those of us who need the foamy feeling üòÇ\n\nIt has a fresh, herby-spicy fragrance that is characteristically from thyme. Quite mild, doesn't linger at all and only lasts for a few seconds when massaged on a wet face and rinsed.\n\nThose who like the smell of tea tree, rosemary or similar green fragrances would like it. Maybe even people who like minty/menthol face washes. I personally really enjoy a herby fragrance, so I enjoyed using it every morning ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è Packaging - a very cute lilac tube. Looks and feels great, but at least initially, the products tends to run out and it dispenses too much just with gravity. It's better to open it with the cap upwards and then flip it down to dispense. A small detail, but mildly annoying at first.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èEffects\n\nFoams quickly and applies very smoothly on a qet face - no dragging at all. The foam only lasts a few seconds after application on the face, and quickly disappears.\n\nThe result is a nicely cleansed face that isn't too stripped of oils. Using a smaller amount gives a gentler cleanser, and using more gives a stronger cleanse. \n\nHere's my problem - after about two weeks of using it daily in the mornings, I started experiencing mild barrier damage and redness. Especially around the nose corners (a tell-tale sign for those with sensitive skin). My skin texture became slightly bumpy all over, and I saw a few pinrpick pustules. Initially I figured I'd just dial back the exfoliation, but that didn't make a difference and eventually I stopped using this cleanser. Within two days my skin was back to normal and drinking up glycolic acid like nobody's business üòÇ\n\nJust goes to show, even sensitive skin is sensitive TO very particular things. I also use acids in my routine, so that might have had some impact, but I personally find that my skin likes acids and is more likely to react badly to botanical extracts in general. Just confirms that ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI didn't find it affected my acne in any way, but considering my skin's reaction, that doesn't mean much.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏èFinal thoughts, pros and cons\n\nI actually really liked using this cleanser, and am somewhat disappointed it didn't work for me. I think it's a nice product, something of a level up from menthol type acne face washes of the past. A nice gateway product for men who are stuck on the \"for men\" train to try normal skincare üòÇ\n\nI think it would probably work quite well for people of all sebum levels, oily, combo, even dry if used in small amounts. \n\nNormal and resilient skin types would probably find it works well. If you're not using any serums or treatments for acne, I think it's worth a shot to see if this cleanser helps.\n\nIf you have sensitive skin I would use with caution, especially if you already know your skin reacts badly to essential oils, since the extracts are key constituents of those. This doesn't guarantee it won't work for you, just a heads up to keep an eye on your skin (like I did - no real harm done).\n\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è **Repurchase status:**\n\nSadly, a WNRP. One of those products that I know a majority of people will probably like, but just doesn't suit me personally. Anyway, I think I can just skip a treatment cleanser in the mornings now (and save it for summer mornings, when I have more oiliness).\n\nI'd love to hear from others who have used this product! Searching the sub didn't bring up any full reviews, is why I chose to post, but I know there's people out there using it. See you in the comments!",

    "body": "Hi curlies, I need some help troubleshooting. I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

    "body": "Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to get excited about a cleanser. Some products will offer a slight uptick of hydration, others may provide a nice softening effect. But for the most part, I have found most of the cleansers I have used to fall into two simple categories...low pH and high pH (the latter being something I avoid). That‚Äôs really what I look for over anything else.\n\nOf course, there have been cleansers that have stood out to me by offering a bit more. My first love was the D‚ÄôAlba Pidemont Peptide No-Sebum Cleanser which helped clear excess oil and sebum (it was my 2018 pick of the year). Others from brands like Peach & Lily, Solved Skincare, Make P:rem, and Rovectin helped to soothe my skin. And a few others just smelled good LOL. Glow Recipe, Sulwhasoo, and The Lotus offer products that added a sensorial experience to my cleansing step.\n\nThe Soko Glam Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser takes some of the qualities I mentioned above and takes things a step further.\n\nThis cream/gel hybrid cleanser impressed me pretty much from the initial application. The consistency is similar to other thick ‚Äústicky style‚Äù cleansers like the Then I Met You Soothing Tea Cleansing Gel and the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser. But, there is a visible cloudy/creamy-ness to this product that makes it look a bit more intriguing.\n\nOne of the featured ingredients here is Green Tea Leaf Powder...which I love in the Inward Agas ACue Herbal Mask. Here though, they aren‚Äôt as concentrated and really just offer a pleasant appearance (at least for me).\n\nOther ingredients in the A New Leaf Cream Cleanser include Mugwort Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Celery Stem Extract.\n\nAside from the look of this product...the feel is even more impressive. Honestly, the thick/rich later that can be had from this cleanser is awesome. It‚Äôs been rare (in my experience) to get a foam so dense from a pH balanced product. Few others I have used make this happen but it‚Äôs a lovely surprise when it does.\n\nI had no issue taking my time massaging the lovely lather in...sometimes bringing the product down to my neck/chest just to enjoy the experience. A little bit goes a really long way here though. The smallest dollop/pea sized amount is sufficient for the whole face.\n\nOnce rinsed, the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser leaves behind thoroughly cleansed skin...without being at all stripping. The lack of fragrance gives this product a ‚Äúplain soap‚Äù scent that had me worried about the cleanser‚Äôs intensity...but that turned out to be a non-issue.\n\nIn addition to general cleansing, this product also delivered on its ability to calm/soothe the skin. The relatively high concentration of mugwort...while only on the skin for a short time...seems to pull through and reduce redness/irritation. Because of this, I found myself feeling comfortable in grabbing this product for not only my AM and PM routine...but also as a stand in for cleansing wipes after a workout or day spent hiking.¬†\n\nAfter just about a month with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I am left feeling super impressed. To me, I see the Good Skin Days line as an excellent entry point into not only Soko Glam but K-Beauty in general (I‚Äôll have my review for the moisturizer out very soon). The Prime Time Cleansing Toner wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea...but I know others will love it (some have already professed their love on the Soko Glam site).\n\nThis cleanser totally plays into that by offering a gentle/approachable use, awesomely dense lather, and a pretty great value. I am kind of a cleanser junkie so I‚Äôll be continuing to test other products...but the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser will be making it into several christmas gift bags for friends and family!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Aqua (Water, Eau), Glycerin, Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Acrylates Copolymer, Artemisia Capillaris Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Powder, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Stem Extract, Coptis Japonica Extract, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder, Brassica Oleracea Acephala Leaf Extract, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Citric Acid, Potassium Cocoate, Sodium Chloride, Hydroxyacetophenone, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $16.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser](https://sokoglam.com/collections/water-based-cleansers/products/good-skin-days-a-new-leaf-cream-cleanser) \n\nPS: I have been incorporating the Foreo Luna 3 into my routine for a little over a week, and I want to include a little blurb at the end of each cleanser review to talk about how they played together. As for the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...it‚Äôs not something I would use with the Foreo.\n\nThe little bits of green tea (while pleasing to look at and have on the skin) tend to get caught in the little silicone touch points of the Foreo. I found myself taking just as much time picking/rinsing out the little pieces as I did actually cleansing my face lol! It ended up being kind of a hassle to the point that I set my Foreo aside for the last few days of this review.\n\nNow that I have finished my ‚Äútesting time‚Äù with the Good Skin Days A New Leaf Cream Cleanser...I will be using what I have left to either decant into smaller bottles for friends or just as a body wash. I really want to bring the Foreo back into the fold and for that to happen I‚Äôll need to switch to a different product.",

I assume the description is referring to the Bioflavonoids for the vitamins it says are included. Ironically, Vitamin A (which this includes) can refer to retinol as well.\n\nIn any event, there is no reason that you can't use vitamin C and retinol together in the same routine (other than potential irritation).

First it was only on her groin, but now she got it on the rest of the body too - basically it looks like dandruff. \n\nI took Truffle to the dermatologist and she told me its nothing serious and to wash her with an oat shampoo. She recommended me one but it has SLS and I'm not sure about using it - is it not that good for hair and skin as it is with humans? I also found few different ones, but I don't think I know enough about dog hair and skin to pick the best one. \n\nI figured itd be best to ask professionals, I hope it's not a bad place to ask this question.

    "body": "So personally, coconut oil in hair products absolutely destroys my hair. I have to stay far far away from it. It will become incredibly brittle, frail, and prone to breakage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've found Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, and Sodium Lauroyl Sarcossinate in a shampoo I just bought and had used twice. I was wondering what \"Derived from plant oils\" meant exactly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpon looking it up, all of these cleansers are derived from Coconut / Coconut oil. Would it be safe to assume this will have a similar affect that coconut oil does on my hair, and to not use it? Thanks in advance to any insight on this topic!",

    "body": "I've been trialing shampoos for a while and they all cause acne on my neck, hairline, and side of my face that I sleep on.\n\nI only don't get acne in these places when I don't use shampoo and then as soon as I use it, within a week then acne develops. \n\nThis is what ti recently used and got the acne. I'm not sure what to do.  And if there is a such a thing as a surfecant free shampoo? \n\nNot sure if it's another ingredient. Trying to figure it out. I know that Butelyn Glycol irritates my skin, but that's not in this. \n\nWater/Eau, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Fragrance/Parfum, Honey Extract/Extrait de Miel, Niacinamide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Histidine, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, Tetrasodium EDTA\n\n",
