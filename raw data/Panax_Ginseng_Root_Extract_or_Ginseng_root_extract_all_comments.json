    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nI was first prescribed Retin-A at 18 years old. I used it on and off from age 18 to 21. I have been using it consistently (5-7 days per week) from age 21 to 25 (my current age). I now use 0.1% retin-a almost every night and a few months ago I started using TO 30% AHA + 2% BHA once a week. The AHA + BHA makes my skin really smooth and helps with SFs on my nose. It does not cause redness, dryness, or irritation for me. Could I be doing damage to my skin that I can't see? Or is it ok to use as long as I don't see or feel irritation?",

I use Pixi toner day and night, it's given me a really nice glow but it might've been too much use.

Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

All of these do not have fragrance. Both Isntree creams are great for daytime use (gel cream in the summer and moist cream in the winter). The Illiyoon Ato Lotion is for the body and even face if you prefer a little more occlusivity with a balanced moisture and has been a great all-arounder and extremely economical. Innisfree Ato Cream is a great choice is you really want to lock it all in overnight.***\n\n**My Skin: c-c-c-c-c-COMBO. My skin is drier in the winter and oily in the summer.**\n\nThe hyperlinked ingredients will take you to CosDNA analysis of each product.\n\n***PRODUCTS: ALL DO NOT HAVE FRAGRANCE ❤***\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Aqua Gel Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_fe18517608.html) Water, Methylpropanediol, Coco-Caprylate/Caprate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Betaine, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Trehalose, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium PCA, Phytosqualane, Isostearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethylcellulose, Propanediol, Phenyl Trimethicone, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n* **Review:** *I have used this for the past 6 months, and I can say this gel-cream really shines in the summer for daytime use. It is extremely hydrating, but  in the winter, it really lacks in the 'locking in water' department. I'd say this texture and performance is really similar to the cult-fave Belif Aqua Bomb and is a lot cheaper. It gives a burst of hydration with a hint of moisture, does not have any stickiness, and does not pill with sun protection layer. Has not caused any breakouts for me, but of course, avoid if you have a HA sensitivity or live in dry climate. People with pure oily skin will have more longevity in using this throughout the year. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills gel-cream.*\n\n***Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream:***\n\n* Store: Jolse\n* Price: $10 (sale)\n* Size: 100 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d36c550998.html) Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Dipropylene Glycol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Betaine, Behenyl Alcohol, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Cynara Scolymus (Artichoke) Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Pteris Multifida Extract, Beta-Glucan, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylpropanediol, Fructooligosaccharides, Raffinose, Ceramide NP, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Pentaerythrityl Distearate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Cholesterol, Folic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Polyquaternium-51, Tromethamine, Ammonium-Acryloyldimethyltaurate-Vp-Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I also used this cream for 6 months, and this is a great daytime cream for the winter. The texture here is more reminescent of Belif Moisturizing Bomb and is even more economical! This cream gives alot of moisture and balances a little bit of hydration and emollience. It takes in a bit more time to rub in and it is slightly sticky after application but that feeling goes away fast especailly when layering with sun protection. I have had zero breakouts using this cream and I recomend this for combination skin that gets drier in the winter. I have also used this at night, but I prefer a little more occlusiveness. It may be good for oily or combo skin at night if you prefer a lighter cream. I probably will not repurchase because I love to try new products, but I have also enjoyed using it and it practical price. Overall a great no-frills moisturizer and I look forward to try other products from Isntree.*\n\n***Illiyoon Ato Ceramide Lotion***\n\n* Store: Olive Young\n* Price: $37 (1+1 deal)\n* Size: 2x 528 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2f20551004.html) Purified Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Shea Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hydrogenated Poly (C6-14 Olefin), Clohexasiloxane, Lactobacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Perilla Frutescens Sprout Extract, Magnolia Kobus Flower Extract, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA (Ceramide PC-104 32.75ppm), Mannitol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethicone, Diisostearyl Malate, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Cholesterol, Palmitic Acid, Propanediol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA\n* **Review:** *I have used this for a month on both my body and my face, and I think out of all of these this is my favorite. I think some may not like that it leaves thin film of occlusiveness, but for me that is a plus. Locking in moisture is critical for me. It truly excels as a body cream because it does not feel sticky. This lotion is filled with so much goodness such as ferments, ginseng (korean antiaging plant), shea butter, and a bit of ceramide. It melts in to your skin and moisturizes it well. In the winter, I also enjoy it as a both a day and night face cream too since it is more emmolient and occlusive than the Isntree HA Moist Cream. Out of all the purchases, this has been a must purchase forever for my body and has an added bonus that I can use it on my face when I want to mix up routine.* \n\n***Innisfree Ato Soothing Cream***\n\n* Store: Jolse \n* Price: $23 (sale)\n* Size: 150 mL\n* [Ingredients:](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_bdc7551007.html) Purified Water, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Panthenol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 Alcohols, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Arachidyl Alcohol, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Cholesterol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Sorbitan Isostearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Disodium EDTA, Madecassoside, Glucose, Arachidic Acid, Myristic Acid, Acorus Calamus Extract, Asiaticoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiatic Acid, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Leaf Extract, Tocopherol.\n* **Review:** *I have also been using this cream for a month, and it is a very impressive barrier cream. It is buttery and harder to rub in, but this will 100% lock in your routine. Judging by its formulations and comparing to Innisfree Derma Formula Green Tea Probiotics Cream, I can guess that it is about 3% cermamide. This cream does not give much moisturzation, but if you are using a layering a routine it will seal all of the steps in, especially layering an emulsion before it. I feel like with this cream, it has an antiaging effect because my fine lines has redued probably due to its effectiveness as a barrier cream formulated with the ceramide and centella antioxidants! This one will be loved by those with dry, sensitive, or combo skin that loves a good barrier cream. I will probably repurchase, but I know there are other products to try in a similar catagory!*\n\nEdit: Added details addressing fragrance :)",

Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

I'm pretty sure these are all  the same base sunscreen with the same protection. I would get the sunscreen with the simplest ingredient list and whichever one is cheapest. The About Me Be Clean seems to be alcohol and fragrance-free (non sure if rosemary leaf oil is an essential oil and fragrant??). I would probably go with the Innifree though because I prefer alcohol in my sunscreen, otherwise they are too too dewy and greasy looking, and the ingredient list is rather simple. If only it didn't have fragrance, but I can compromise with that. The Dr. G has too many unnecessary ingredients and many comedogenic ingredients like myristic acid, so I would stay away from it.",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

    "body": "*Moisturisers seem to be the most boring and ignored category in a skincare regime but I have learnt over the years that they actually play the most important role. Sometimes actives are not what your skin is looking for and a good moisturiser can be the game-changer.*\n\n[Just a pic](https://preview.redd.it/p39fzjc4kx661.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=027cc219d95e8947525507a3beec33a9d459f961)\n\nBefore I review the products, these are my expectations from my moisturiser.\n\n1. ***Hydrate:*** Bring water/moisture to my skin\n2. ***Emolliate:*** Thanks to kindofstephen (google his blog or insta if you haven't) for providing a term to my feelings. Make my skin soft and supple by nourishing my stratum corneum with nourishing lipids without clogging my pores.\n3. ***Strengthen my barrier:*** To reduce TEWL by strengthening my barrier so that my skin stays hydrated and supple for longer. This also means I want the moisturiser to have slight occlusive properties.\n4. ***Repair:*** To help my damaged/sensitised skin by repairing my skin barrier.\n5. ***Extras/added benefits:*** Would like if the moisturiser additionally helps to deliver certain ingredients that help with targetted issues like ageing, hyperpigmentation etc. This is not a must though.\n\n\\---\n\n***1. Avene Skin Recover Cream -*** ₹*1500 (depends on discounts); Cost Per gm: ₹30/gm*\n\nThis is my go-to skin-emergency product. I do not use it on daily basis. The texture is cloudlike but not mousse-y. It is a lightweight cream. Nevertheless, it packs a punch. I have gone through 8+ tubes of this stuff. It is the only cream that does not aggravate any sensitised areas (burning/redness/dry patches/peeling patches) and absolutely calms my skin. This cream is true to its name. Repairs compromised flaking, sensitised skin in two days with twice/thrice a day usage. The ingredient list is very minimalistic. It is expensive and the sterile patented packaging kind of sucks because you will most definitely have face squirts if you are not careful. However, I can rely on this cream to fix my skin mistakes.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: HG, It is easily available in India but shit is expensive.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types, Sensitive skin***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum), Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, Squalane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Serine, Carbomer, Tetrasodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Water (Aqua)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2. Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream -*** *$10/* ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nI tried this product a month back and I am in love. This cream is perfectly balanced. It adequately hydrates and emolliates my skin. My skin feels supple and bouncy without being too greasy and the moisture lasts. I did not see noticeable calming benefits but as a moisturiser it is lovely. The tube is huge and a little goes a long way. This has a slight cooling effect when applied to the skin. Also uses a patented encapsulation delivery mechanism to delivery pseudo-ceramides (lab-made) which help to strengthen your skin barrier. In short, it is a simple no frill moisturiser that is easy to use - not too thick, not too thin, not too heavy, not too light, doesn't sensitize, not too silicone-y, doesn't pill, value for money.\n\n* Hydrate: 4/5\n* Emmoliate: 4/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0/5\n* Status: will repurchase.\n\n***Perfect for: All skin types***\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Stearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Palmitic Acid, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide Mea, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Magnolia Biondii Flower Extract, Cholesterol, Perilla Ocymoides Seed Extract, Lactobacillus/​Soybean Ferment Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, C14-22 Alcohols, Glyceryl Caprylate, Dimethiconol, Mannitol, Cyclohexasiloxane, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Arachidyl Alcohol, Acrylates/​Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polysorbate 20, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Propanediol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Eucerin Q10 Anti Wrinkle Face Cream -*** *$9*\n\nThis is my third tub of this cream. This cream is richer than any cream in the lot. It has a thick emollient texture without being too greasy. It absorbs easily in the skin. It also contains shea butter, SAP and Ubiquinone (Q10). This cream has helped me transition into tretinoin. Do not recommend it for day time use (especially in summers) but for night time/winters it is perfect. It keeps my face moisturised through the night and it has a soft blurring effect on fine lines/skin texture. It did not sensitize peeling skin but helped repair my barrier. I use this regularly at night and it helped to fix the acute dryness that comes with tretinoin. I use it around my eyes and it hasn't given me milia/ clogged my pores. My mom loves and swears by it. She finds it makes her wrinkles look softer.\n\n* Hydrate: 3.5/5\n* Emmoliate: 4.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 4/5\n* Extras: 3/5\n* Status: HG but not readily available in India. Will stock up when relatives come post covid.\n\n***Perfect for:*** *Combo-dehydrated/Dry/ Mature skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Stearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Octyldodecanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ubiquinone, Biotin, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Beta-Carotene, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phenoxyethanol*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume -*** ₹*1300 (with shipping/customs); Cost per gm* ₹6.5/gm\n\nThis cream is unique. As the name suggests it is a cream-balm hybrid but the texture is surprisingly lightweight. Highly emollient with occlusive properties. It absorbs quickly into the skin as the texture is not too heavy. Sadly, it leaves a greasy feeling/film on my skin. I can not use it the day time and worry that it will clog my pores if I use it on my face. I love it for the body especially my Sahara hands. It seriously brings life to my hands and I do not need to reapply often. I did notice a calming effect. Many of my friends from the community love to use it on their face. It is a little too heavy for my face. If your face is very dry, I think you may like this.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 4/5\n* Repair: 3.5/5\n* Extras: 0\n* Status: WNRP at least for my face.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Extremely Dry Skin*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Aqua/​Water/​Eau, Glycerin, Paraffinum Liquidum /​ Mineral Oil /​ Huile Minerale, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Sucrose Stearate, Canola /​ Canola Oil /​ Huile De Colza, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/​Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Pentylene Glycol, Beta-Sitosterol, Xylitol, Zinc Gluconate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Palmitamide Mea, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Rhamnose, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Phytosphingosine, Ceramide Np, Mannitol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ceramide Ap, Cholesterol, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Ceramide EOP*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream -*** ₹2700 *(estimated); Cost per gm* ₹45/gm\n\nI was sort of disappointed with this product. It is not a bad product but it is not necessarily better. The soft blue colour deceives your mind to think the cream texture may be light. It is actually slightly thick with a silicone-y feel. It has a cooling effect on the skin when you first apply it which tricks the calming feeling. While it is hydrating when you first apply it but compared to others I feel the moisture does not last as long. Also, it makes the sensitised area skin sort of burn. The feeling is not intense but very much against claims. I did not notice any calming/repairing benefits. It may also not be enough moisturisation for the winters. The colour is aesthetically pleasing and silicone-y texture + cooling feel can outwit you into enjoying application but I do not see many real benefits.\n\n* Hydrate: 3/5\n* Emmoliate: 2.5/5\n* Strengthen my barrier: 3/5\n* Repair: 3/5\n* Extras: 1?\n* Status: WNRP, Expensive.\n\n***Perfect for:***  *Oily/ Combo Dehydrated Skin?*\n\n***Ingredients list***: *Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylic/​Capric Triglyceride, Centella Asiatica Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Glyceryl Stearate, Stearic Acid, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Polysorbate 60, Bees Wax, Chlorphenesin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Morus Alba Root Extract, Tromethamine, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Guaiazulene, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Lecithin, Acetyl Glutamine, SH-Oligopeptide-1, SH-Oligopeptide-2, SH-Polypeptide-1, SH-Polypeptide-9, SH-Polypeptide-11, Bacillus/​Soybean/​Folic Acid Ferment Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol*\n\n&#x200B;",

    "body": "Here’s a comment I posted about Avant:\n\nAvant’s Deluxe Hyaluronic Acid Vivifying Face & Eye Night Cream (this was being sold in the FFF edit sale last week), we were suppose to get this last December for premium box but instead we got the Pro-Intense Hyaluronic Acid Illuminating Day Cream instead, it’s the same RV $134 and has equally crappy ingredients, I’ve seen hand creams/body creams with better/actual effective formulas.\n\nIngredients for the Avant Face & Eye Cream: aqua (water), Butyrospermum Parkii (shea) butter, glycerin (humectant) cetyl alcohol (texture enhancer, emollient), glyceryl stearate (emulsifying agent), dicaprylyl ether (emollient), propylheptyl caprylate (emollient), dimethicone (type of silicone occlusive), sodium hyaluronate (salt form of hyaluronic acid), niacinamide (Vitamin B3, excellent antioxidant has many beneficial properties), maris aqua (sea water, has more minerals than tap water), Prunus Amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil (emollient which contains lots of skin nourishing fatty acids), allantoin (skin soothing), tocopheryl acetate (vitamin e), peg-75 stearate (texture enhancer, emulsifier), ceteth-20 (texture enhancer), steareth-20 (emulsifier) propylene glycol (humectant, texture enhancers), disodium edta (too lazy to explain this one) sodium polyacrylate (thickening agent, texture enhancer), xanthan gum (thickening agent), lactic acid (when used at this kind of low concentration most likely it’s being used as a pH adjuster), parfum (fragrance), potassium sorbate (preservative), ethylhexylglycerin (preservatives) CI 15985 (orange dye) (FD&C Yellow No. 6), CI 17200 (red dye) (D&C Red No. 33).\n\nHere’s the ingredients for a $134 moisturizer.  It doesn’t take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There’s nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn’t worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it’s $134.  Avant products AREN’T EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it’s like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it’s just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there’s CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM’s hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere’s copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it’s that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain’s Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury’s Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant’s Micellar Water it’s missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of “high end/effective” micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they’re selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin’s online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the “real” moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achillée) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin’s site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / PÊCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BLÉ) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHILÉE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it’s made with lotus water, there’s no lotus anything in the ingredients. It’s full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the “gel texture” of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that’s $200 isn’t that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I’m assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it’s $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the “made for beauty boxes 111skin products” will have “Made in China for 111skin” on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it’s made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin’s site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the “fake” ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren’t even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn’t matter if Avant’s website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it’s still a scam.",

On their Instagram they even have a FAQ where someone asks who the CEO/Founder is, and they say that \"They don't focus on the CEO/Founder but the brand only\"\n\nNot to mention their website copy is absolute garbage and super vague, and though they say they're back by science it seriously just seems like they are using science-washing terms. \n\nCame on reddit and saw this post that validated everything I was feeling.",

    "body": "\n**To preface**\n\nShort-ingredient products **DO** have their benefits, 100%, I'm not going to argue with that. Especially if you have sensitive skin, or when you're first getting into skincare and trying to figure out what your skin likes. This is especially true for any exfoliating or acne products with AHA/BHA/Retinol/bakuchiol/benzoyl peroxide/etc. OR unstable products like vitamin C. \n\n**Now that that's out of the way**\n\nLately I've been finding myself less and less interested in skincare products with 1-3 \"star\" ingredients. Particularly moisturisers, oils, and serums. The biggest offenders I ALWAYS see usually promotes 1-3 of these ingredients; and the rest of it is just your typical moisturiser/filler/serum. \n\n* snail essence \n* hyaluronic acid \n* niacinamide \n* centella asiatica / cica\n* propolis / honey / royal jelly / 💐🐝\n* squalane \n* green tea\n* rice\n* ceramides \n* lipids \n* chamomile \n* collagen \n\nEtc etc. This is obviously a short list\n\nI'm *personally* looking for an intense, multi-ingredient  moisturiser or serum with multiple well-known, acedotal or researched ingredients. Like an overnight intense mask or something I imagine. But I'm leaving it up for *any* notable product that's formulated well with tons of good ingredients. \n\nI *would* give examples but I honestly just don't know many Asian multi-ingredient products. I hope its okay to list a few examples that aren't as well, just to give you a better picture:\n\n* **Sulwhasoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask**\n\n*(I used a sample, but I haven't purchased yet)*\n\n> **Notable ingredients:** Patented \"RED Elixer (Pomegranant extract + Jujuba?)\" Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tocopherol, licorice root extract, hyaluronic acid, beta-glucan, green tea extract, Squalane oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, hyaluronic acid, silica, Lecithin, Shea Butter, Honey, mulberry extract, white mulberry extract, lotus seed extract, tiger lily extract, Chinese foxglove root extract, walnut shell extract, Solomon seal, cocoa seed extract \n\n> *and other herbs* Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract (golden herb), Ophiopogon Japonicus Root Extract, Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, Chrysanthemum Morifolium Flower Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Adenophora Stricta Root Extract, Angelica Tenuissima Root Extract, Angelica Acutiloba Root Extract, Trehalose,  \n\n* **Kate Ryan’s Total Nutrition Night Repair Complex** \n\n*(Its currently sold out / I haven't purchased it yet)*\n\n> **Notable ingredients:** centella asiatica, Hyaluronic acid, Fermented sea kelp, ubiquinone, resveratrol, green tea extract, turmeric extract, tocotrienols, DMAE, Astaxanthin, Niacinamide, Retinyl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Beta-Carotene, Tocotrienols, Tocopherol, **oils** jojoba, Squalane, pomegranant, Sesame Seed, Sweet Almond, Avocado Oil, Coconut Endosperm Extract, \n\n* **Faded Topicals**\n\n> **Notable Ingredients** Tranexamic acid, licorice root, kojic acid, tumuric butter, azelaic acid, Squalane, niacinamide, alpha-arbutin,  Allantoin, Centella Asiatica extract, argenine, Lecithin, soybean, triglycerides, jojoba, shea butter, glycerin, melatonin",

        "body": "I think sometimes it’s risky AND difficult to formulate products with a TON of those star ingredients. The more you put in, the less of each great ingredient you can include, and the more people you start to isolate because of personal sensitivities or dislikes. For instance, many people are sensitive to Niacinamide. Or for me personally, shea butter makes me SUPER itchy and ruined my lips.\n\nAB I think lends itself to potentially including more of these ingredients because concentrations aren’t usually as intense as western products are. Plus, AB typically swaps out boring water for “special ingredient” waters like Centella asiatica leaf water. But, this also begs the question of at what point are these ingredients so diluted that they don’t offer real benefit anymore? How much of “Centella asiatica water” is actually active good stuff from Centella, like Madecassic Acid? How concentrated is centella extract vs water, too?\n\nTake something like **Purito’s Centella Unscented Serum.** On the surface, it seems just marketed as a Centella serum because… that’s what it is, mostly. But also contains: ceramide, Hyaluronic acid, peptides, arginine, panethenol, tea leaf extract, sea daffodil extract, and even a component of licorice root extract and adenosine. Plus jojoba technically too. Look at how much of its list could be considered a star ingredient.\n\nIngredients per Stylevana: **Centella Asiatica Extract(49%)**, Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol,\nGlycereth-26, **Ceramide NP, Sodium Hyaluronate, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid, Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-10,** Carbomer, **Arginine,** Sclerotium Gum, **Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters,** Caprylyl Glycol, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, **Panthenol,** Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, **Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract,Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Disodium EDTA, **Adenosine**.\n\nThe reality is I have no idea if these ingredients are in concentrations that would be beneficial to me. Other than being pretty sure on the Centella stuff, the adenosine, I have no clue if switching to this as my main source of panthenol would be enough?\n\nAnother example is **Peach + Lily’s Transparen-C Pro Spot Treatment.** It’s in an oil format, so depending on you personally classify individual oils, it could be totally full of numerous good things. For me personally I get a bit excited about: the vitamin C derivative, jojoba, squalane, the three forms of Hyaluronic acid, licorice root extract, ferulic acid, tranexamic acid, kojic dipalmitate, and maybe the vitamin e too. \n\nHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Camellia Sinensis Seed Oil, Squalane, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tranexamic Acid, Kojic Dipalmitate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water (Aqua)\n\nTheir FAQs state that there is less than 0.5% of the tranexamic acid and kojic acid COMBINED, though, so I’m not sure how excited to get about  those ingredients. If those are less than half a percent, will there be enough of my favorite oil squalane? Since I only know it to definitively have a high percent of vitamin C, I’m waiting until I finish one of C products to switch to this one… it’ll combine my morning C + oil, but honestly probably nothing else.\n\nI just started using the **Hada Labo Shirojyun Premium Light Lotion** as well, and although I see multiple star ingredients (tranexamic acid, dipotassiun glycyrrhizate, two forms of Hyaluronic acid, vitamin C), I anticipate that the concentration of the vitamin c is so much lower than what I need for it to be effective and essentially use it only for tranexamic acid in a hydrating toner step… which I also really don’t know it’s concentration either. Maybe I’d actually be better off with a serum of a known high amount of TXA and very little else, even.\n\nDon’t get me wrong- I’m here for adding more good things in if it doesn’t compromise the formula (eg, using extracts and special waters to replace boring water). I figure even if it the ingredient isn’t in a high enough concentration for me to notice effects, “every little bit counts” in those cases. I’m also here for combining more steps and ingredients into singular products! I just think there’s probably a point where stuffing more good stuff into a product actually makes the product overall less effective, so I’m wary about products with a ton of those really good things in them.",

        "body": "ETA:  I think it’s much more difficult to find an elegant product that effectively harnesses one or two star ingredients.  I pay a lot of money for a cleanser that has very few ingredients because my skin is ridiculously sensitive.  But it’s elegantly formulated to make use of very gentle surfactants, has no fragrances or oil, and is low ph.  \n\nIf you can find a product that can do this, that’s a win in my book.  I gravitate toward the single ingredient formulations that may have fillers, but they are fillers that are exceeded helpful for making the single ingredient work better.  That’s something to consider.  An ingredient doesn’t need to be an active to be useful. \n\nThere’s some middle ground between filler and active, is what I’m saying.\n\n—————————————————\n\nWhat I love about AB is precisely the one-star ingredients factor with mild fillers.  That allows me to layer and use what I need that day, ingredients-wise.\n\nIt might be more helpful to consider the guidelines for listing ingredients:\n\nIf less than a certain percentage, or an extract/ botanical it can be listed *anywhere* on the label.  It doesn’t have to go behind the ingredients that comprise the majority of the product.  If it is not an extract/ botanical/ fragrance and less than one %, such as preservatives, it *does* have to go behind the main ingredients in descending order of amount.  \n\nSo, this means a botanical could hypothetically comprise less than .01 of the ingredients and be listed *second.*. You will think you are getting that botanical in large quantities, but it is in fact a filler. \n\nSo, the point is, fillers are fillers are fillers.  Either way, a moisturizer is constituted of oil/water, emollients/ occlusives/ humectants, preservatives.  That’s what’s required.  Pretty much everything else is either an additional active or filler, or both, which may or may not help. \n\nI think your desire for complex ingredients conflates “complex” and “lots of stuff which may or may not be an active.”  \n\nAlso:  I do think, contrary to most people, that even small amounts tend to do *something*.  They can definitely break you out, so they can also definitely help too.  \n\nPerhaps focus on the ingredients you definitely want and choose the product based on that.",

I really enjoyed that process, and now that things have mellowed out a bit for me, I wanted to start doing the same here. \n\nI generally try to review products that I don't see too often on skincare subs. Past reviews have included [Missha Near Skin Madecanol Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/87r241/review_missha_near_skin_madecanol_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/82f8h9/review_missha_near_skin_total_ceramide_cream/), [Missha Near Skin Phyto Azulen Cream] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8cejd0/review_missha_near_skin_phyto_azulen_cream/), [Tosowoong Apricot Seed Cleansing Oil] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7u2j65/review_tosowoong_apricot_seed_cleansing_oil/), and [Benton Honest TT Mist] (https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/7trt3u/review_benton_honest_tt_mist/). Today I wanted to review one of my favorite masks: The Body Shop Ginseng and Rice Polishing and Clarifying Mask. \n\nI hope you enjoy the review, and as always, please feel free to leave questions and feedback!\n\n**The Body Shop Chinese Ginseng and Rice Clarifying and Polishing Mask**\n\nI *love* masks. Like seriously **love** them. And as much as I enjoy a good sheet mask, there's still something about a nice wash-off mask that feels like you're really pampering yourself. I still have very high expectations for my wash-off masks though...they can't just feel nice. I also expect them to address my skin concerns, which are mainly acne, PIE, and dryness/dehydration. \n\nI spotted this particular mask in someone's shelfie over on ScA, and hadn't heard of it before, so I popped into the Body Shop one day to have a look. I was a bit hesitant to try it, as I was worried it might be too drying. It's ended up being one of my favorite products, and I'm so glad I took the risk. \n\n**Packaging:** This product comes in a 3oz/75ml dark brown glass jar with a black plastic lid. It's surprisingly heavy for its size, but has proven fairly durable...the lid has stayed intact for as long as I've had it, and while I haven't dropped it, the jar did survive an international move with no problems. Aesthetically, it's apothecary/minimal, so if you're into Aesop's vibe, you'll probably like this too. I know not everyone is keen on jar packaging, but I personally don't mind it. \n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nThe star ingredients in this mask are kaolin, salicylic acid, ginseng, and rice extract. The first two are acne-fighters; kaolin is a type of clay that's known for being less drying than other types of clay while still providing similar acne-fighting, pore-reducing benefits. And we all know salicylic acid as everyone's favorite BHA. While the percentage isn't listed, it's high enough on the ingredients list that I'd estimate (very unscientifically) it's somewhere in the 1% range, and expect to see an impact. Rice bran extract is an emollient ingredient ([source] (https://cosmeticsinfo.org/ingredient/oryza-sativa-rice-extract)) but in its powdered form, can be a mild exfoliant. I'm not sure which form it's used in here, but given the slightly grainy texture of the mask, I'd expect it's powdered, and is acting as an exfoliant rather than an emollient. Ginseng is touted for its anti-aging benefits, and has been shown to act as an antioxidant, have an anti-inflammatory effect, and stimulate blood flow to give you a bit of a glow ([source] (https://www.refinery29.com/42123). Beeswax and shea butter in the ingredients list also made me a bit more optimistic when considering the product--it seems like there was definitely some thought that went into making this a clarifying product that still wouldn't strip dry skin too much. \n\nThat's the good stuff. However, there are a lot of potentially sensitizing ingredients in there. Denatured alcohol features pretty high on the ingredients list. I personally don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, but it's something to watch for those who do. Fragrance is also higher on the list than I'd generally like, so those who are sensitive to fragrance, beware. There are also some fatty alcohols, as well as limonene, and linalool. If you have especially sensitive skin, this product is probably not for you.\n\nThe full ingredients list is:\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Luffa Cylindrica Fruit, Kaolin, Sesamum Indicum Seed Oil/Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, PEG-100 Stearate, Alcohol Denat., Decyl Glucoside, Cera Alba/Beeswax/Cire d’abeille, Perlite, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter,Parfum/Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Menthol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract/Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Root Extract, Disodium EDTA, Citral, Citronellol, Linalool, Menthoxypropanediol, Tetrasodium Pyrophosphate, Eugenol, Dextrin, Oryza Sativa Extract/Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, CI 77891/Titanium Dioxide.\n\n**Price:** I bought mine in the UK for £17; it retails for $28 in the US, but The Body Shop often runs sales and 3 for 2 deals. \n\n**Use and Performance:**\n\nLike I mentioned when talking about the ingredients, this is a clarifying mask that seems to have been formulated with dry skin in mind. This is very clearly reflected in the texture of the mask. It's far creamier than your typical clay mask, and doesn't dry down as completely. The mask itself is an off-white colour, and the creamy clay consistency also includes a grainy element (most likely from the rice). It smells very strongly of ginseng, which I love. You apply this like you would any other clay mask--spread a thin layer over your face using your fingers or a brush, then wait 15-20 minutes for the mask to dry down, and then rinse it off. \n\nI don't find that this mask dries down as aggressively as other clay masks I've tried, and I don't feel like my face is about to crack at the end of 20 minutes. I usually prefer to wash this mask off in the shower, because it can be a bit difficult to wash it off cleanly without making a total mess--consider yourself warned! My face does feel a bit tight afterwards, but it's nothing that a few layers of Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion and Scinic Honey AIO can't fix. \n\nI see instant results from this mask. My pores immediately look smaller, and my skin has much more of a glow. If I use it at night, I wake up the next morning with a significant reduction in my acne. I also find it reduces my PIE, which was something I wasn't expecting! I use this mask once a week, or twice a week if my skin is especially congested, and I find that it clears up any random acne or texture issues that I'm dealing with. \n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is a really great mask option for someone who needs an occasional serious acne-fighter, but is also worried about dryness. Oilier skin types may be able to use the mask more often than dryer skin types. It's definitely not a one-stop miracle acne product...I rely on Differin (currently, previously Skinoren) to keep my acne under control in the long-term, and use this mask to address random breakouts and congestion. It's also probably not great for more sensitive skin types, I'm sorry to say. And if you're dehydrated, you'll probably want to steer clear as well--clay and salicylic acid won't do your moisture barrier any good!\n\nOverall, it's a very effective, pleasant to use mask that I consider a holy grail, and will continue to repurchase for as long as I can. \n\n**My Rating: 5/5**\n\n",

I personally have not come to a conclusion on reactions from long term exposure to fragrance, whether citrus extracts increase photosensitivity, and the effectiveness of formulas with lots of plant extracts like here. When I saw how much phenoxyethanol the Imperial Bird's Nest contains I was immediately turned off. \n\nApple polyphenol seems low in irritants and Aloe is high in sodium hyaluronate.\n\nMBD is a very established mask brand in Taiwan. They started in 2003, but they have only released masks so far. There have been many other brands that have made it in and out of Taiwan since then, like Naruko for those looking for targeted treatments and White Essence with lotions more advanced than Hada Labo. \n\nThere are many other sheet masks ranges in Taiwan, and they have to be good enough to retain market share against market leader MBD.

    "body": "[PICTURES!](http://imgur.com/a/1mrcR)\n\nHere's my redditview on **Fuji Bee Venom Cream** (First formal review!)\n\n The seller I bought through was on Ebay.ca and can be found [HERE](http://m.ebay.ca/itm/FUJI-Bee-Venom-Cream-For-Reduce-Wrinkles-and-Fine-Lines-Immediate-Face-Firm-10g-/321726819632?varId=510629229001&txnId=1657617508011) I highly recommend them.\n\n\nFuji Bee Venom Cream is a lightweight gel cream (similar to the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream).  As you pat it in, it absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave a tacky residue. It feels a little sticky just as it's finishing soaking in, but that goes away within 30 seconds. The finish is matte and dry to the touch. I even put a second coat over it and same results. The texture is very pleasant and not at all goopy or slimy(as I can find the Mizon to be)  \n\n It smells pleasantly like honey with undertones of a sort of generic wildflower scent and peaches.. I find the smell inoffensive and mild. While I don't notice it lingering on my face, it sticks around faintly when I sniff my hand.\n I am scent-sensitive, I have what is considered to be moderate/severe asthma and this product did not cause any kind of flare up. I also sometimes develop mild hives from some types of fragrances and had no reaction.\n\nI have really liked the results from using this product so far. It plays nicely with everything else in my routine and is a nice boost for my dehydrated skin this winter without feeling too heavy. The hydration is light and not occlusive. This didn't stop or slow any of my other products absorbing. I find that my fine lines were less noticeable and experienced a brightening effect. My skin is left feeling soft and lightly hydrated, it makes my skin happy haha\n\nThe Fuji Bee Venom Cream line also has a serum and a sleeping pack. I have not tried them but if they're anything like this product I'm going to like it!\n This product comes in a 30g jar or 10g resealable pouches. The packaging is pretty and sturdy. Even the pouches have a well made screw cap.\n\nNow; something that some people may not like is there is a noticeable gold shimmer in this product. Personally I like it and think it looks pretty on it's own or with makeup. I was kind of suprised at how much shimmer was in this product at first. The particles are very fine and do not feel gritty on application. It is quite shimmery but is so fine that it doesn't make you look like a disco ball. \nMy husband despises sparkles and even he said \"that looks nice\" and said it's not disco-ball-y.  You could always use it  as a night-only part of your routine. Disclosure: I might be biased. I love highlighters, it's my favorite type of makeup :P\n\nYMMV but I like it :) I will be repurchasing this item and will be using the same Ebay seller when I do. They were great to deal with.\n While there are some potential acne irritants in here, I didn't experience any issues with my VERY blemish prone skin. There are some very good ingredients in here and was enough for me to take the plunge.\n\n\n\n**INGREDIENTS AS LISTED** *AQUA, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CARBOMER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, BACILLUS/SOYBEAN/FOLIC ACID FERMENT EXTRACT, BEE VENOM, HONEY EXTRACT, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, PROPOUS EXTRACT, POLYSORBATE 20, ROYAL JELLY,SACCHARIDE ISOMERATE,  ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, NIACINAMIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, FRAGRANCE, EDTA, BENZISOTHIAZOUNONE, METHYUSOTHIAZOUNONE, Ci 77480*",

I just switched to AG Haircare Volume Shampoo (with the matching conditioner) and I love how my hair looks after use. It takes care of almost all frizz, gives me gorgeous volume, and contains sulfates (something I definitely need in a shampoo). BUT, it does not feel like it cleans my scalp as well as other shampoos, despite having that \"stripping\" feeling in the shower. Now if this was 2014, I'd think I was \"over-drying my hair and it was producing more oil\" but alas, updated information.\n\n**My question:** Why can I can barely get it to lather? I don't have super hard water, and I can lather other shampoos much easier than this one. What determines the lathering level in a shampoo? \\*Side note, I have heard that lather has little to do with cleansing level of a shampoo, but I'm not sure if thats a myth or not because it sounds anti-sulfate to me.\n\n**Shampoo Ingredients:** Aqua (Water/Eau), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Coco-Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Propylene Glycol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Tilia Tomentosa Bud Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Humulus Lupulus (Hops) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Prunus Serotina (Wild Cherry) Bark Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Keratin, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Trioleate, VP/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzophenone-4, Tetrasodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, CI 19140 (Yellow 5), CI 42090 (Blue 1), Citric Acid.",

    "body": "A bit of backstory.\n\nBack in the old days of 2015, when I was just an AB baby I mainly gravitated to 2 sheet masks - Tosowoong Propolis and Benton High Content Snail. They had soothing ingredients and the fragrance was unobtrusive. Both of them were kind to my acne and speeded up healing and I discovered that a good sheet mask can give you a great, almost meditative experience.\n\nFast forward a few months and Snow White and the Asian Pear, one of the OGs of this sub, was posting about Hanbang in K-beauty - traditional herbal medicines being incorporated into cleansers, serums, masks etc. Among them was a post about Evercos masks, fully named Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Sheet Mask. I read those posts over and over while I was making up my mind, thinking “They can’t really be this good, right?”\n\nFinally, in 2016, I suffered less from acne and more from post-acne marks that would linger for months. All the rage those days was licorice extract, famed for its ability to even out skin and remembering that one of the flavors of the Evercos masks was licorice, I finally took the plunge. This was back when 11st offered huge shipping discount coupons, so after all the fees and discounts, I managed to snag 40 masks for about $2 CAD each (mainly licorice but a few of each kind).\n\nI was in love. These masks had a thick essence and an incredible fit on my huge face - a super thin mask sheet that was a second skin in ways that hydrogels promised (but never delivered). They would remain wet for 40 mins in the dry winter air and my skin was visibly plump and hydrated the next morning. The ingredients were great and the fragrance was subtly herbal and super relaxing. I would layer serums under them and the absorption of them was heightened and my face was never too sticky for the pillow again. Their packaging was beautiful, even though later on they went with a more minimalistic, matte aesthetic. I kept repurchasing them throughout 2017 and the first half of 2018, mainly from Gmarket.\n\nWhen I finally ran out of these masks last winter, I noticed that the listings I’ve been buying these masks from have disappeared. I searched far and wide, searching 11st, Gmarket and various other sites in both English and Korean, trying to figure out why Evercos vanished. Eventually, I found that the company who used to manufacture these perfect yet affordable masks has discontinued them and instead there were these Sooyeonhoo masks in a similar aesthetic - minimalistic, Hanbang, matte. Even though there was barely any info about them on the internet, I ordered 20 of each of the Ginseng and Pearl & Mulberry (whitening), hoping to recreate the experience of my favorite Licorice and Ginseng Evercos masks.\n\nI started 0.025 tretinoin in the Canadian winter and in the meantime, I’ve been using Japanese bulk sheet masks like Lululun, Japan Gals and Kose Clear Turn which were fragrance-free and somewhat hydrating but nowhere near Evercos. Once I finally found a seller who didn’t claim that each mask had a shipping weight of 400g (making the shipping fee for 40 over 100 CAD), I placed my order on April 3rd and received it on April 8th (5 days babyy) totalling $83 CAD for 40 masks.\n\nIt’s been about a month of me using them on non-tret days (every other day). First off, ingredients.\n\n**RED GINSENG NOURISHING:**\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Benzyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Raspberry Ketone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Adenosine, Beta-Glucan, Panax Ginseng Root Extract (500ppm) Trichosanthes Kirilowi Fruit Powder, Allium Tuberosum Seed Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Kernel Extract, Thuja orientalis Extract, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Castanea Sativa (Chestnut) Seed Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Kyounin Yu, Cnidium Monnieri Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrhizate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance.\n\n**PEARL MULBERRY ROOT BRIGHTENING:**\n\nAqua, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Benzyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Raspberry Ketone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Polyglyceryl-10 Myristate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Adenosine, Beta-Glucan, Pearl Extract(880ppm), Morus Alba Bark Extract(870ppm), Trichosanthes Kirilowi Fruit Powder, Allium Tuberosum Seed Extract, Prunus Persica(Peach) Kernel Extract, Thuja Orientalis Extract, Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract, Castanea Sativa(Chestnut) Seed Extract, Coix Lacryma-Jobi Ma-yuen Seed Extract, Sesamum Indicum(Sesame) Seed Extract, Kyounin Yu, Cnidium Monnieri Fruit Extract, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Propanediol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy favorite thing about the Evercos masks was that each mask would contain 1% of the extract in its title (licorice, ginseng, etc), however Sooyeonhoo masks contain much less of the star ingredient. Each mask contains a variety of herbal extracts, a minute amount of licorice-derived dipotassium glycyrrhizate and a fair amount of niacinamide.\n\nThe mask material itself is thicker and the essence is thinner compared to previous Evercos masks, which makes the fit a bit worse. The mask sheet is still quite wide which is great for people with larger than standard faces (me). The mask stays wet for at least half an hour.\n\nThe ginseng mask smells like the Evercos ginseng mask, but a bit stronger but the pearl mulberry is much more floral and perfumey. I miss those subtle earthy herbal smells of the old masks.\n\nPerformance - moisturizing, non-irritating but not much else. I have niacinamide in quite a few of my skincare steps, so not much brightening resulted from their use. I don’t think I will repurchase these in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will keep looking for the holy grail ultra thin translucent sheet with thick essence, bomb hanbang ingredients and a subtle fragrance mask...the search continues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Original Luxury Bogam Herbal Clinic Sheet Masks ruined me for any other sheet masks and the new Sooyeonhoo offering is a pale imitation. Why were they discontinued, why? :(",

Are you asking if there's anything wrong with drinking energy drinks? You're an adult, so I don't think so. One of my nutrition professors says he drinks energy drinks. I'm pursuing a degree in dietetics, and I drink energy drinks. If all you're drinking is 2-3 cans a week, I think it'd be difficult to substantially prove that you're doing your body any harm. If there is evidence of that, I'd like to see the research. :)\n\nI probably have a few cans of the same drink you're talking about in my fridge right now. That's mostly because my dad got me some cans that were on sale at the market. I'll say again, the Rockstar is more than likely not causing you any substantial amounts of damage. I think that a cup of coffee contains a better \"nutrient profile\" than an energy drink, but don't let anyone fool you into thinking that a couple of Rockstars a week is going to shorten your lifespan. If I can level with you, I'd reckon it'd be a lack of exercise that does more harm.",

I'm listing the prices converted from the retail price in Korea so you can see whether you're outrageously overpaying if you do decide to go look for any of these online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SIDMOOL**\n\nMost products from this brand seem to fragrance-free. They're quite popular in Korea, it looks like. Sensitive skin-friendly, mid-range to very affordable price, good performance/rave reviews. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu73nuoc8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3671e9c6328bb8cab34a24366fac08d06ace645f\n\n1. **Pure Bifida 95 Ampoule - 30ml/24,600 Won ($20.94)**\n\n*Bifida Ferment Lysate, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nBifida ferment is the \"star\" ingredient that makes up most of the famed Estee Lauder night recovery serum if you didn't know (although it matters which strain was used apparently, same with SK-II & their dupes). It's said to strengthen your skin barrier over time and provide very slight, gentle exfoliation. Reviews for this Sidmool serum I have read on the Hwahae app do confirm that many people felt their skin became \"stronger\"/less sensitive. Many also said their skin tone & texture improved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmd5qi5e8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9d487bb091642b6ee3ea1e20e2b1f4cc276b0e4\n\n2. **Skin Sauce D Panthenol Ampoule - 12ml/11,800 Won ($10.04)**\n\n*Water, Panthenol, Pantolactone, Xanthan Gum, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root (Chinese Skullcap) Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root (Tree Peony) Extract.*\n\nPanthenol is a great barrier repairing ingredient. Research shows using 5-10% is the best for skin penetration. It's said to be very healing. Note the tiny size, however. 12 ml = 0.4 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc56mwli8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af5deb3f6d7af94d6cd14851695dd3a721e599c8\n\n3. **Madagascar Real Moisture Cream - 80g/23,800 Won ($20.26)**\n\n*Centella Asiatica, Glycerin, Hydrogenated lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Paeonia Suffruticosa (Tree Peony) Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis (Chinese Skullcap) Root Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyl Undecylenate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Madecassoside, Asiaticoside, Madecassic acid, Asiatic acid, Astaxanthin, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Beta-Glucan, Panthenol, Vaccinium Angustifolium Fruit Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Ginkgo Biloba Nut Extract, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Tocopherol, 1,2-Hexanediol.*\n\nThis lightweight gel-cream (Koreans call watery/hydrating creams \"soo boon cream\" meaning \"moisture cream\") is a crowd-pleaser, starring centella and many other soothing ingredients such as Chinese skullcap extract, allantoin, licorice root (the soothing component, not the skin-lightening), and madecassoside. It also has polyglutamic acid, beta-glucan, and hyaluronic acid as humectants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi4q3uak8ku31.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0af940dc986ca78892585f4a03d2fd7b23a3b96a\n\n4. **Honey Peptide Moisture Pack - 40ml/9,800 Won ($8.43)**\n\n*Honey Extract(40%), Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Hyaluronic Acid, Sorbitol, Propolis Extract,Royal Jelly Extract, Human Oligopeptide-1, sh-Polypeptide-11, rh-Oligopeptide-2, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Beta-Glucan, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Origanum Vulgare Leaf Extract, Caffeoyl Tripeptide-1, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Glycine Max (Soybean) Seed Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Butylene Glycol, Sucrose, Fructose, Glucose, Trehalose, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Allantoin, Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract, Glucosylrutin, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\nA lightweight, gel-textured sleeping pack. This has been #1 for sleeping packs for a while now, too. Reviewers say this is very hydrating. It's absolutely *stuffed full* of humectants: honey, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sugars, beta-glucan, collagen, and peptides. Some soothing ingredients as well, allantoin, licorice root & extracts. Very dry skinned people said it wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfr8w5oo8ku31.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdcfdfe41ba52ad5d588187902b7d00420478a4\n\n5. **Calendula Ampoule Moisture Cream - 80ml/16,800 Won ($14.30)**\n\n*Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Calendula Officinalis Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceramide NP, Ceramide EOP, Ceramide NS, Ceramide AS, Ceramide AP, Cholesterol, Glyceryl Stearate, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) Root Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Water, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Xanthan Gum, Dipropylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Heptyl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\nA gel-cream with skin-soothing calendula flower as the star.

CoQ10 molecules are really big though, so it has trouble penetrating. Idebenone has smaller molecules so it can do the job better. I heard that the patent on idebenone ended recently, so maybe we can see more of this goodie in future products. There are also peptides in this ampoule, as well as some soothing & firming ingredients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdnxp8cu8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72616b051ce0532bd51287099a4e28de9871ec0f\n\n7. **Green Tea Peeling Gel - 120ml/4,800 Won ($4.09)**\n\n*Water, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water(10%), Glycerin, Cellulose, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Betaine,Beta-Glucan, Arginine, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Allantoin, Sodium Polyglutamate, Carbomer, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil.*\n\nThis is wildly popular, being so affordable. It's a nice, basic peeling gel. Fragranced with lavender essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cvgwgvv8ku31.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b79356fcf60cdd09f5435cd76817e90c5f036c1\n\n8. **Jojoba Lip Essence \\[Original Moisture\\] - 13ml/3,800 Won ($3.23)**\n\n*Polyisobutene, Petrolatum, Diisostearyl Malate, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Microcrystalline Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Royal Jelly Extract, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Tocopheryl Acetate*\n\nThis lil' lip balm has been #1 on the Hwahae app for a while now. Which surprises me, personally, as the Korean skincare community is going through a major \"EWG is best source/natural is better\" moment right now. But hey, I guess if it works, it works. Fragranced with orange essential oil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oz9arxe39ku31.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff34a25e8bccfe68e01a8ccc85e304df7b1b0826\n\n9. **Saccharo Ferment Therapy Essence - 60ml/24,800 Won ($21.11)**\n\n*Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Polyglutamic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharomyces/Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Human Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Water.*\n\nI think some of Missha fermented products use Saccharomyces. Whenever you see a ferment ingredient/whatever extract, that means that plant has been fermented to make the nutrients in it more bioavailable for us.

I guess everyone has different experiences and for this sun cream, I’m the opposite. \n\nMy skin is dry right now as it’s winter down under. I find the BoJ and Round Lab are very similar in consistency. They’re a thicker viscous gel that forms this film over the skin, and it takes ages to dry down for me. It also leaves a blue and white cast on me especially if I reapply and/or don’t apply makeup over it. It is more moisturising and hydrating compared to the Skin1004 though. \n\nThe Skin1004 water fit sun serum spf is a lighter lotion/cream type that gives that burst of hydration without that thick film. Also there’s no blue/white cast and it sinks in very quickly (like a serum). I can apply makeup after a few minutes whereas the other two, I usually have to wait for much longer for it to dry. \n\nI do prefer the other two for winter since it’s more thicker and moisturising, but I’d definitely be using the Skin1004 for the rest of the year as I think it would be great for warmer weather/reapplication.",

I mean, I understand that our experiences with products might be different, but the Skin1004 Water-Fit feels like 10 times heavier than the BoJ or Round Lab Birch. The Air-Fit version - which is a physical sunscreen - was actually really pleasantly lightweight, but this... Feels like a moisturizer for winter time, that takes ages to soak into the skin, but does not absorb fully and leaves a bit of stickiness. Which is interesting, because it really does have a serumy texture, so one would imagine its just gonna dissapear into the skin, but as for me, a layer is kind of just sitting on top. The BoJ one feels a lot lighter to me and also absorbs into my skin a whole lot faster. But this is just my experience. I imagine this must he nice for dry skin or in the winter for some. Btw there are quite a few sunscreens with the same base: Round Lab Birch Sun Cream, Romand Zero Clean Fresh, Benton Air-Fit UV defense (these are all the same Kolmar base formulas)",

I don't like having things around, and I don't even know that I'd like a floral scent, but I still look at them every now and again since they're so cute.  :/\n\nI love the Bring Green packaging as well - you can tell I've spent time on Olive Young's site.  I don't need any of it, but I do like to look at it every now and then.\n\nI'm happy Aromatica has a new line.  Everything I've tried from them, with the exception of a hair oil that I dislike the smell of and a physical sunscreen, has been pretty good.  The cica-panthenol oil from their new line seems interesting as does the glow sleeping mask - it's also less than 1/2 the price of the one I was going to use if my current sleeping mask ever runs out.  So that's something to consider.  :)",

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl18p3drb6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c564fa513071af08b08743c2da57e8bd991bf14e",

Cleanser - Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam, Toner - Rosewater (Kama or Khadi Naturals), Essence - Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, Moisturizer - Beplain Cicaful Calming Gel. \n\nUsage: I used the BOJ Relief Sun for approximately 2+1 weeks, after the above routine. I reapply once after lunch usually. I try to rinse my face beforehand, but sometimes have to just apply on top of the existing layer.\n\nIngredients:  Water, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract (30%), Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Niacinamide, Methylene Bis-benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Coco-caprylate/Caprate, Caprylyl Methicone, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Germ Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract, Saccharum Officinarum (Sugarcane) Extract, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Monascus/Rice Ferment, Pentylene Glycol, Behenyl Alcohol, Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Decyl Glucoside, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2-Hexanediol,Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol, Lactobacillus/Rice Ferment, Aspergillus Ferment, Saccharomyces/Rice Ferment Filtrate \n\nTexture, Consistency, Fragrance: Feels like a lightweight moisturizer. Thinner consistency, as expected with chemical sunscreens. It doesn't really dry down, leaves you with a more dewy finish. I didn't see any whitecast when using 2-3 finger lengths. No significant fragrance. \n\nResults & Experience: My first impressions of this sunscreen after initial use were great. It has an amazing texture and the lightweight formula was a dream to blend and to reapply. I didn't experience any pilling or issues with any of my other skincare products. \n\nThe first issue I had was that the sunscreen burned/tingled for a few minutes in my eye area during application. However, since my skin is so sensitive, I'm used to that happening with chemical sunscreen formulations, and didn't consider it that much of an issue. I applied an extra layer of moisturizer around my eye area to help combat the issue. I continued usage normally. \n\nI used this product for about a week and started noticing significantly more acne than usual, but I shrugged it off. I was ovulating and typically do experience more acne breakouts during that time, so just thought it was due to that and decided to power through, thinking it would settle down soon enough. In retrospect, wrong time to start using a new product, but who really has the patience to wait after the product has arrived (not me!). \n\nThen, in week two the breakouts moved from being regular whiteheads and pimples to giant, red cystic acne. That's when I started suspecting the sunscreen. While I am acne prone, I almost NEVER get cystic acne, and within this week I had 5-6 spots all over my face, that were hurting to the touch. I discontinued use of the sunscreen and switched to a known non-irritating sunscreen for 2 weeks for my skin to calm down. \n\nRandomly, last week I decided to give it another try. In the first two weeks of usage, it was super super hot, and I was sweating buckets all day, every day. My workplace doesn't have AC in the lab, so I was exposed to the extreme heat and thought that could have also be a cause of the acne. I wanted to confirm before giving the sunscreen away. I was sitting in the office for the last week, which does have AC, but same results. Thankfully, I stopped usage before it reached the cystic acne stage again, but uncountable smaller breakouts. \n\nBottomline, this sunscreen definitely did not suit my skin. I am not entirely sure what caused this reaction. I suspect I might be sensitive to niacinamide, but normally in small percentages it is okay. Also, some other reviews said it might be the fermented ingredients, but I have used a few products which included similar ingredients without issue. I guess it is just the overall formulation and the combination of potentially irritating ingredients together. \n\nOverall: 2/5, WNRP. I will not even be able to finish the tube, and have already given it to my mom since her skin is much less sensitive.",

    "body": "I wanted to start the New Year with a new herb and I was pretty excited about this Korean Red Ginseng ND sells. I read for hours about ginsenosides and controlled studies and all... My intention was to improve circulation during winter, help with lifting and appetite, and fight afternoon fatigue. I was also suspecting low cortisol as I don't respond well to Ashwagandha nor Tongkat anymore. They mostly disturb my sleep and they make waking horrible...\n\n  Well Ginseng did the same! After 200mg in the morning, I felt more energized  but also a bit spaced out. Next morning I woke up sluggish, but really wanted it to work so I took it at this dosage for a week. The days I went to work(landscaping), it really gave me endurance and a sort of \"strength\", but would also leave me flat emotionally. Mental stress were blunted, but joy and satisfaction too to some degree.  This was similar to long-term high dose of Ash, but worst. Ginseng would make me kind of sluggish in the morning, energized in the afternoon, but wired at night... The insomnia took a week to kick in and this is when I stopped. It also made me dreams a lot about relapse (4 years sober here), and gave me a few disturbing wet dreams, which is uncommon.\n\n  This is only my experience and I don't want to give the product a bad rep. It is clearly potent! Some compounds  just don't always match our biology at a given time and it's better to move on. We can always come back later or try a different version!",

        "body": "Thanks for sharing your experience with our Panax ginseng root, and sorry to hear it didn't work as expected for you! Some of the ginsenosides are unique in that they mimic cortisol too, so they can actually give a bit more of that \"positive stress\". I really like Panax ginseng for this reason during lower stress periods when I need a little bit more motivation, while still being protected against sudden surges in stress. \n\nThat all being said, the root extract definitely is on the more calming side of the spectrum. If you ever wanted to try Panax ginseng again, I would recommend the leaf extract which is much more stimulating and barely calming at all, it feels very different! That all being said, it sounds like you perhaps just don't respond great to the ginsenosides, so perhaps it's better to skip it all together! \n\nI have found resveratrol to actually help with quite a few of the goals you are interested in. Might be worth giving that a shot someday. I really like it stacked together with our Rhodiola rosea 3% salidroside extract for these purposes too, but you do again run a slight risk with cortisol with Rhodiola rosea. However, I do find it to be more energizing rather than calming!",

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

I recently just purchased the no7 Protect and Perfect facial suncream in SPF50, 5 star UVA from Boots http://www.boots.com/en/No7-Protect-Perfect-Intense-Facial-Sun-Protection-SPF-50-50ml_1483958/\n\nI've been using it for just over a week, and my skin is looking amazing. It is clearing up my redness/uneven skintone and PIH - my skin looks almost as clear as when I was 13, before I started tanning heavily in the summer (I'm 22). Previously I was using the no7 protect and perfect daycreams, because they had spf15 in and 5 star UVA protection. In comparison to this suncream though, they barely did anything to noticeably improve my skin. \n\nAs far as application goes, I find it moisturising but not too greasy (haven't had any trouble with it breaking me out). I've been having trouble finding a good facial sunscreen so pretty pleased I gave this one a go :)\n\n\n\nIngedients:\nAqua (Water), C12-15 alkyl benzoate, Octocrylene, Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene glycol, Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol (nano), Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine, Tribehenin, Cetearyl alcohol, Glycerin, Diethylhexyl butamido triazone, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium cetyl phosphate, Decyl glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Mica, Acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, Methylparaben, Xanthan gum, Tocopheryl acetate, Ethylhexyl salicylate, Actinidia chinensis (Kiwi) fruit water, Propylene glycol, Sodium hyaluronate, Ethylparaben, Ascorbyl glucoside, Hydrolyzed rice protein, Potassium hydroxide, Alcohol, Tetrasodium EDTA, Retinyl palmitate, Medicago sativa (Alfalfa) extract, Sorbitan laurate, Panax ginseng root extract, Carbomer, Dipropylene glycol, Polysorbate 20, Morus alba leaf extract, Sophora angustifolia root extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium benzoate, Ascorbic acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methyl benzoate, Tocopherol, Acetyldipeptide-1 cetyl ester, Palmitoyl tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7, CI 77891 (Titanium dioxide).",

Niacinamide is known to help hyperpigmentation from acne scars and overall skincell turnover.\n\nIn my experience most asian skincare that has whitening or brightening in their description refers to skincell turnover rather than bleaching. The ones that actually bleach would use that in the description (ie bleaching soaps).\n\nI think the ingredient to look out for if you're concerned about bleaching would be hydroquinone. But again, not an expert in ingredients and I've never tried a product that has it so I could be wrong.",

I can't tell from the description if there's a physical attachment device, or if the mask will just stick as sheet masks do.  The tab on the forehead part is a bit confusing to me though, since that will make people's hair goopy.\n\nIt looks like it has fragrance at the bottom of the list, I wonder if it means old lady fragrance since it's an anti-aging mask?  I have so many questions.  If I found it in a local shop I'd probably grab one to see what it was all about.  :)",

I probably use this about 3-4 times a week, sometimes more.\n\nThe propolis one, tho... Not sure about it yet, maybe it just doesn't play well with other products I use. It does give my skin a glow and it is hydrating, however, it feels sticky on my skin and I'm not for that feeling. I wanted to use that as a part of my morning routine but due to the sticky feel I prefer it in the evening. But in the evening I prefer to focus on calming serums so I don't use it as often as the green tea one.",

Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nThanks so much!\n\nEdit: Here's a list of the ingredients from Nordstrom's website.\n\nAvobenzone 3%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Octisalate 5%, Water (Aqua), Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Propylene Glycol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cetearyl Alcohol, Coco-Glucoside, Tocopheryl Phosphate, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Oil, Squalane, Corylus Americana (Hazel) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Retinyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Behenyl Alcohol, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Lecithin, Lauryl Alcohol, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Bisabolol, Butylene Glycol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Echinacea Purpurea Extract, Algae Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pentylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Serine, Urea, Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Allantoin, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Oil, Carbomer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, o-Cymen-5-ol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Red 4 (CI 14700).

    "body": "Papa Recipe Bombee Sheet Masks\n\nMask Materials for this Set vary from Mask to Mask. The Whitening and Regular Honey Mask both featured a typical Cotton Type Mask…but they were incredibly easy to stretch and fit over my Face. I’ve heard this type of Cotton-Blend Material called “Tencel Sheet” or “Cupra”…but I don’t know of the formal name that Papa Recipe gives theirs. The Black Honey Mask Pack has the same Material…but it was black in color. The Rose Gold Honey Mask Pack also has a similar Mask Material, however there is a fun/interesting Gold Honeycomb Pattern on the Mask. Finally, the Ginseng Red Honey Oil Mask Pack uses a Paper Mask Material.\n\nI’m going to touch on each Mask individually and then go over how I felt about the Set a whole as well as select some favorites. As far as Ingredients, I’ll do my best to list as many as I can…with an emphasis on what sets each Essence Formula apart. Keep in mind that the Scent for all of these Masks was Honey/Vanilla across the board (to my). Some were more fragrant than others…and the Scent did tend to linger. But, I really enjoyed it and didn’t find the potency to be an issue. Also, all of these Papa Recipe Honey Masks had the same thin yet Serum-Like Consistency…other than the Reg Ginseng Mask (see below). \n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Whitening Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This Whitening Mask contained Ingredients such as Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, and Green Tea Leaf Extract as well as some new/interesting Hanbang Ingredients for me including Sweet Flag Root and Beefsteak Extracts. But, these Ingredients were in most of the other Masks. What set this one apart from the others was the addition of Niacinamide and Sodium Hyaluronate for extra brightening power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As you’ll see in my experience with most of these Papa Recipe Masks…there wasn’t a ton of Essence to go around. I was only able to keep this Whitening Mask on for 10 minuets before it began to dry. After removal my Skin did feel slightly hydrated…but the effect wasn’t that impressive. Also, I didn’t seem to notice any significant brightening. Once the Excess Essence was fully absorbed, it left behind a slightly tacky residue…probably due to the Honey and Propolis in the Formula. \n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Honey Mask:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* For this Mask…Papa Recipe kept it relatively simple compared to the others in this Set. Other than the Ingredients found in all of the other Masks…this one didn’t have a “Special/Featured” Ingredient. Once again I was only able to keep it on for about 10 minutes. I did find this Honey Mask to give me the classic “K-Beauty Glow”…but the result was short lived and the tacky/sticky feeling was apparent here as well.\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Black Honey Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The Black Honey Mask was the third that I used in the Set and it included Ceramide in the Ingredients List. In addition, the Black Mask Material also gave the Essence a slight Grey Tint that I found interesting. This Mask was a bit more saturated with Essence and I was actually able to keep in on for 20 minutes…and probably could have gone longer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After removal I was happy to see that my Skin looked and felt very hydrated and plump. Also, some of the redness I was experiencing from Exfoliation had diminished. But, as with most of these Bombee Masks…the tacky/sticky feeling was there. For this Mask, it was even more intense and took about 10 minutes after application to fully absorb.\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Rose Gold Honey Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In addition to the unique “Honeycomb Foil Pattern” of this Rose Gold Mask’s Material…Rose Flower and Pearl Extract were the Featured Ingredients. Of all the Honey Masks in this Set, this one was SOAKED in Essence lol! I kept this one on for 25 minutes before removal. Afterwards my Skin was super hydrated and also brighter in a way that not even the Whitening Mask was able to provide. Also, I found this Essence Formula to be a bit thinner and my Skin easily absorbed the excess. Not as much of that sticky feeling with this one!\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Ginseng Red Honey Oil Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The most intriguing (to me) of this Set…this Ginseng Mask used a totally different Mask Material and Essence Formula than the rest. I typically am not a fan of Paper Masks…as they tend to be more rigid and difficult to keep on. But, this Mask managed to stay in place pretty well considering the Paper Material. Also, the Essence Formula was Oil Based..and felt a bit more luxurious on the Skin. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As for the Oil/Essence Formula…it contained some of the Highlighted Ingredients from the other Masks (Rose and Sodium Hyaluronate). But, it featured Ginseng Root Extract…which is one of my all-time favorite Skincare Ingredients! I loved the Herbal Scent of the Ginseng combined with the Honey…pretty amazing in my Eyes lol! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I was able to keep this Mask on for 20 minutes and after removal my Skin was hydrated…but in more of a nourishing was as compared to the Water Based Formulas found in the other Bombee Masks. My Oily/Combination Skin does not always do well with Oil Based/Occlusive Formulas…but I was happy to find that this Essence absorbed super quickly into my Skin without leaving a heavy/Oily Layer. \n\nWell there you have it lol! Overall it has been a pretty great week of Sheet Masking. Although I found all of these Papa Recipe Bombee Honey Masks to perform pretty well…the Rose Gold and Ginseng Masks were the standouts to me. The Whitening, Original Honey, and Black Masks just didn’t have the long lasting effect that I was hoping for…and some even felt a little dry right out of the Package. Also, I wasn’t a big fan of the tacky/sticky residue left behind by them. The Rose Gold seemed to do a better job of getting all those wonderful Ingredients deep into my Skin. And, the Ginseng Oil Mask was a surprisingly different consistency that actually played really well with my Skin Type. \n\nI was lucky enough to find these Papa Recipe Bombee Honey Masks at a local Asian Gift/Beauty Store for $3.99 USD each…but they seem to bit more affordable from Online Shops. Personally, I would only consider repurchasing the Rose Gold and Ginseng Versions. But, I think the Scents, general Hydrating Effects, and fun Packaging are quite appealing. The Ginseng Oil Mask was the standout overall and I think it would be perfect for most Skin Types…especially with the drying/cold Winter Weather! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j03kb6o7y3n41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=728dd3f6bcaf808772f8144f3b7028238b102821",

    "body": "I wanna preface this by saying I know a lot of posts get made by people looking for help, and that maybe it's a bit selfish of me to ask for further help especially with how long some people have been suffering compared to me. But there's so much info and anecdotal advice out there  that I'm a bit overwhelmed and at a lost. What I would like out of this post is a more concentrated, conscience, \"up-to-date\" reference for what I can or should do to help myself. Hopefully this would be something useful to anyone, not just me.\n\nAdditionally, I've made posts on r/AskDocs and on r/DiagnoseMe in the past attempting to figure out what is wrong with me, you can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/sieq2u/i_23m_have_been_experiencing_intensely/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/rmnmmm/stayed_up_for_nearly_22_hours_and_now_feel_ill/).\n\nAnyways, I (23, Male, Unvaccinated Moron) am certain I got Covid in mid- November 2021. It was relatively moderate in intensity, \"really bad flu\" comes to mind to describe it. It was pretty rough and there were a couple times I was worried for myself, but I never got bad enough to go to the hospital. I was sick for 2 weeks and a few days, lost my sense of smell and taste for the last several days. I had gotten tested the second day of my symptoms, but it came back negative. Considering my housemates and I were exposed to someone who themselves was exposed to a person who tested positive, we all got sick, and my housemates would later test positive despite also initially testing negative from the same testing center as I; it must have been a false negative. My symptoms were pretty standard if I recall correctly. \n\nI had felt recovered the beginning two weeks of December, and went about my life as usual. Then, on the evening of December 22nd, I was hit with the most intense feeling of malaise, delirium, and nausea I've ever felt in my life. Felt like I was suffering a stroke and a heart attack at the same time. My brain raced with this intensely odd feeling of confusion and delirium. I couldn't think, my brain felt like it was \"dried out\", as if the core of it were shriveling into a petrified rock. I felt dizzy and unsteady, despite being in bed and lying still. My stomach twisted and churned, but I never threw up. My heart would go from hammering intensely to barely beating; my breath ran short. I suffered fatigue, sweats, chills, tremors, and an intense anxiety I've never experienced before. I had my first true panic attacks I ever recall having that night. I was awake the entire night, sitting upright in bed, waiting for something to change or improve. I tried to sleep and continually failed. I may have passed out for an hour around 5 AM, but honestly I was never sure of that. It was so bad that I had woken up one of my roommates and asked them to take me to the ER (despite me being uninsured at the time). She dismissed it as only a panic attack, and told in several different ways that I'd struggle to get anyone to see me anyways. She told me to just wait until they got up in the morning, and if I still felt bad she'd take me then. Well, I did wait, and I still felt terrible. Long story short, the ER found nothing wrong with my vitals, gave me some pills for nausea (that did little to nothing to help), and sent me out the door. In the weeks after, I'd go to a different ER, to two different doctors, and an urgent care, all in an attempt to get a diagnosis and help for the symptoms I was experiencing daily. None so far have found anything wrong, and have chalked it up to anxiety and stress.\n\nMy symptoms so far have been:\n\n* Confusion/delirium \n* Difficulty thinking clearly/impairment to thought \n* Headaches \n* Feeling of pressure inside cranium and ears \n* Dizziness, especially when moving \n* Unsteadiness \n* Trouble tracking moving things with eyes \n* Disorientation\n* Nausea, without vomiting \n* Loss of appetite \n* Thirst, despite drinking plenty of water \n* Weird, inconsistent bowel movements and feces\n* Fatigue and lethargy \n\nThese I experience every day, without end. I also have inconsistently and occasionally experienced the following symptoms:\n\n* Tinnitus in either ear \n* Muscle cramps in leg, palms of hands \n* Shortness of breath \n* Feeling heart pounding through body\n* Anxiety\n* Restlessness\n\nI've noticed recently that I've gotten more fatigued, just a few days ago grabbing a full box of cereal felt like grabbing a 5 lb weight. I'm also feeling cold more consistently, and like my breathing is somewhat restricted. My headaches and feeling of malaise have subsided a somewhat very recently, but not fully and I'm otherwise still experiencing the rest of my neurological symptoms. I've accrued a strange odor from my body that smells like burnt metal or onions. It's most noticeable from my armpits, farts, and feces. The first day of my symptoms aside, I haven't had too much difficulty falling asleep. I've noticed it's maybe been taking a bit longer to fall asleep, and a few weeks ago I wasn't sleeping for as long as I normally would and would wake up feeling drained. But otherwise I'm sleeping consistently, so I got that going for me. \n\nIn my efforts to find out what's wrong with me and to help in whatever way I can, I've ended up on this regiment of supplements: \n\n* Daily multivitamin (One A Day Men's) \n* Vitamin D, 1000 IU \n* Stessballs Destress Relax Ashwaganda gummies, 230 mg herbal blend of ashwaganda root and leaf extract, lemon balm leaf extract, and ginseng root extract.\n* Solgar B - Complex \"50\"; 50 mg of Vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, Biotin, Inositol; 666 mcg DFE of Folate; 21 mg of Choline; 3.5 mg Herbal blend of kelp plant, acerola fruit extract complex, alfalfa leaf and stem, parsley leaf, rose hips fruit, and watercress herb. (Have only started taking this recently.)\n* CV Sciences Calm CBD gummies, 10 mg CBD from 20 mg hemp extract, 100 mg L-Theanine, 50 mg 5-HTP. (Have only started taking this recently.) \n* Prebiotic Fiber supplement gummies \n* Align Probiotics (ran out and haven't taken in a while) \n\nI'm not sure what, if any of this, has helped, but it makes me feel like something is being done, so...\n\nMedical attention so far hasn't been any help, other than confirming I'm not immediately dying (as far as they can tell). They either have no idea what's going on with me, or just chalk it up to stress and anxiety. In my time being sick, I've considered everything from brain tumors, to toxic exposure, to intestinal parasites. So far I've gotten no answers, and have felt doomed to suffer my strange unidentifiable illness. It's felt like no one is listening to me, or taking my symptoms seriously. If I have to wait weeks only to have a doctor stare at me for 10 minutes like I have corn growing out of my ears before shoving me out the door one more time, I'm gonna snap. \n\nFinding out about Covid long haulers has been the first time I've felt like there are people who understand what I'm going through, that it's not just in my head. \n\nBut at the same time, I feel a bit overwhelmed trying to take in and learn from all the experiences long haulers have had. So I have some questions: \n\n* Are the supplements I've been taking helpful in combating Long Covid? What else should I be taking? Medications? \n* Should I continue seeing the GP I've been seeing? They're technically not my PCP, but I've only gotten insured recently (Medicaid), so I don't have any history with my assigned PCP anyways. I get the feeling this GP, however, isn't very aware of long Covid. Should I invest in seeing someone at a Long Covid Care Center?\n* What specialists, if any, should I see? \n* I'm worried about what this is doing, or has done, to my long term health. What known issues should I have a doctor/specialist look into/test for? \n* Should I get vaccinated now, or wait for some time? Would it be dangerous for me to get vaccinated now? \n* People have discussed diet changes and easy exercises as something that helps with long covid. What should I know about that? \n* Any up-to-date resources I should look into? \n* I'm seeing that GP tomorrow afternoon. Anything I should know about discussing this with her?\n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. If you've read this far, thank you. I'm quite worried for myself. A quarter of the way into my life and I feel like it's already over, or starting to be over. I read people discussing if this is degenerative heart failure, I read that studies indicate the effects of Covid could lead to Alzheimer's later in life, I'm struggling to function and I feel so... hopeless? Burnt out? Empty? I dunno. Wish I had answers. I'm sure we all do. But at least I know I'm not alone, so that's something.",

        "body": "Have you had a tilt table test yet to check for POTS and similar issues? If your symptoms get worse while upright and get better while laying down it could be POTS, but there are a whole series of other potential causes too.\n\nIt’s probably best to go through your GP, ask for basic medical tests (e.g. basic blood tests to rule out vitamin shortages or other known causes for fatigue) and ask for a referral to a cardiologist (for the heart palpitations etc) and maybe to an ENT specialist (in case there’s something wrong with the equilibrium system in your ears causing dizziness).\n\nSecondly, did they check if you were hyperventilating at the ER? Hyperventilation can cause or worsen a lot of the symptoms you mentioned and some Long Covid patents seem to be more prone to hyperventilation than normal patients (even without anxiety, for example because of dysautonomia). Certain breathing exercises can help with that (e.g. the Stasis breathing program). Breathing exercises have turned out helpful for a lot of Covid longhaulers, so they could be interesting to try regardless of whether you were hyperventilating or not.\n\nFinally, pacing is crucial for a lot of longhaulers in order to avoid crashes and you can find good guides on pacing in the FAQ of r/cfs. Pacing is not a miracle cure, but it can help to greatly reduce out symptoms and prevent flare-ups.\n\nIf you have certain diagnosable conditions like MCAS or POTS other supportive treatments are possible too, but those are very dependent on your personal medical situation and should be guided by a doctor. Supplements usually don’t help that much, unless you happen to have a shortage of certain vitamins or minerals (e.g. of vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, …). A lot of people might swear that certain supplements helped them, but most longhaulers tend to improve spontaneously over time, so it’s not certain if the supplement actually caused their improvement (the joint timing could be a coincidence). There’s one exception though: a magnesium supplement might help against the muscle cramps you mentioned.\n\nGood luck on your longhaul journey, I hope you’ll feel better soon!",

If you have issues with blood pressure or your kidneys, don’t mess around with electrolytes without supervision from a medical professional!\n\nI (and many others) have had to increase intake of sodium, potassium and magnesium quite significantly. The potassium/magnesium completely resolved the muscle cramps, rapid resting heart rate and insomnia for me. The salt really helps with “thirsty regardless of how much water” issues for me - at the beginning I was needing 7,000mg is sodium per day to feel like I wasn’t dying. I now take about 3,500-4000mg. Aim to hit all of the RDA’s for electrolytes, mainly sodium, potassium and magnesium. Many of your symptoms can be exacerbated by dehydration. Water without adequate electrolytes will not be used properly by the body! For me personally, this has been the biggest thing for managing symptoms.\n\nApologies if you know this already.

I have many more “better” days than when I first started with these issues but the symptoms still hit me hard.\n\nI would advise to stay clear of gummy vitamins because of the sugar in them and really try to limit your sugar in foods as well. I’ve noticed that sugar or high carbs even messes with me more.\n\nMy daily routine consists of: aiming for 100-130oz of water daily, getting in electrolytes (I like coconut waters and Relyte powder), vitamins: B complex,  D3 5,000, magnesium Glycinate (helps my stomach more), NAC, super digestive enzymes, quercetin, zinc,  an align probiotic, COQ10, and turmeric for inflammation. I mix and match depending on the day but probably get at least 10 pills a day combined.\n\nOther than supplements, cleaning up your diet should be your top priority. I credit any progress I’ve made to cutting out fast food, hydrogenated oils, and refined sugars. I just started a paleo diet so the only sugars I get in a day basically come from just fruits. Other than that, get your protein in with lots of veggies and snack with seeds and nuts. I’m also not eating grains at the moment to reduce inflammation as possible. Also gotta focus on eating smaller meals to help digestion and blood flow.\n\nSorry if this was hard to follow, typing it up as I’m coming off a light “episode” of symptoms tonight.

    "body": "I already raved in the weekly post about the Shining Pearl variety, but I just put a Red Ginseng mask on my face, and *sighhhhh, this is so dreamy!*  It definitely smells like ginseng, but in a light, elegant way, so maybe this will be a good option for those of you who love ginseng, but not the smell.  Fortunately, the ingredients are right on the package, so I'll list them here--there are a couple of red flags for the super-sensitive, but again, $3.33 for a box of ten at RRS!!!!!\n\nIngredients: Water, glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol, xantham gum, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, sodium hyaluronate, panax ginseng root extract, panthenol, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, sodium citrate, disodium EDTA, allantoin, hydrolyzed collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, witch hazel extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, snail secretion filtrate, honey extract, ubiquinone, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, fragrance.\n\nSo not the best ingredient list for everyone, but far and away not the worst.  Again, a full 23ml of essence in each mask, substantial but soft and pliable mask material, and it really does smell very luxurious.  It's also very gentle (for me) on my skin, and **did I mention they're $3.33 for a pack of 10 on RRS???**\n\nThese masks are truly a hidden gem, and I will probably get every variety they make in my next haul!\n\nEdit: Holy crap, you guys.  I took this off after 40 minutes, and I look.....AMAZING!  My skin is radiant, fat, and SUUUPER calm.  I used the extra essence on my chest, and swear to snail, if you  put me in a corset right now, I could stop or start a war.  Maybe start one then stop it five minutes later, my bosom is so luminous.  I also would seriously consider buying this scent as a perfume, it's that pleasant.  For reference, I have combo/oily aging skin with PIH and--touch wood--no allergies or reactions so far.",

    "body": "My hands always get dry in the winter, but this year I am taking a medication that acts as a vasoconstrictor and my already terrible circulation is struggling to get any liquid out to my extremities. Less tissue perfusion=drier skin. Even things that were reliable stand-bys while I was on Accutane (Eucerin, lanolin, keeping lotion within reach at all times) are no match for my winter Adderal hand dryness. So I have resorted to hand masking. It’s expensive IMO, even buying the cheaper hand masks and giving some side eye to $9 Sephora masks. But I’m desperate! I couldn't find many reviews for hand masks, so I thought I'd start offering mine. Here are little reviews of the four I have tried so far, from the most to least hydrating.    \nHere’s the TL; DR summary: the Absolute are the most moisturizing and the only one that isn’t scented like cheap grandma perfume, but the Smart Hand Milky Moisture are a bargain at half the price and the only ones with a built in adhesive tab to adjust them to your wrists. Tip: for ones without a built in sticky tab, you can use a hair tie around your wrist more easily than scotch taping once you are gloved.\n\n\n**Absolute New York Repair and Care Hand Mask in Tangerine**    \n**Purchased:** Hmart on sale for $3, regular price $4    \n**Ingredients:** Tangerine Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Tangerine Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA Hand Mask – Rose Water, Glycerin, PEG-8, Mineral Oil, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-40 Stearate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Stearic Acid, Arbutin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Paraffin, Methylparaben, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, Rose Extract, Olive Fruit Oil, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Lycium Chinese Fruit Extract, Thuja Orientalis Seed Extract, Soybean Seed Extract, Swertia Japonica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Carbomer, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA    \n**Thoughts:** This one has a strong tangerine scent, no surprise. I was worried the tangerine would be irritating, but it seemed fine. This mask was so effective at moisturizing my sad parched hand that it convinced me to try the others. My Hmart only had this version, but it comes in rose, green tea, and black pearl, all identical formulas except for the main extract and fragrance.\n\n**Repiel Smart Hand Mask Milky Moisture**     \n**Purchase:** Amazon, box of 10 for $20, even cheaper on ebay    \nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Urea, Glyceryl Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1.2-Hexanediol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Illicium Verum(Anise)Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethicone, Fragrance, Carbomer, Arginine, Milk Protein Extract, Goat Milk Extract, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Allantoin, Adenosine, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hyaluronate    \nThoughts: The standard scent for hand masks appears to be cheap grandma perfume: powdery, soapy floral smell. Except for the first tangerine one, these all smell like grandma in varying degrees. These ones have a medium strength scent that blessedly doesn’t linger. The essence in these is not quite as moisturizing as the Absolute ones, but it’s still good. Annoyingly, it’s not well distributed, at least in the box I got--it’s concentrated in the fingers but the thumb of the gloves doesn’t ever seem to have any, so I have to squish it down into the hand part and then squish my hand around in them for a minute to get the essence properly distributed. What I do like about these is that they have a built in adhesive tab at the wrist. So, after you get them on, you can easily tape them closed tight at the wrist to seal in that moisture goodness. At about half the price of the Absolute, it’s pretty easy to forgive the failings.\n\n**Skin Food Shea Butter Hand Mask**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Dimethicone, Butylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Cyclopentasiloxane, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Honey Extract, Milk Protein Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Arginine, Disodium Edta, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance    \n**Experience:** I was sooo disappointed that these smelled like grandma, because I expected a pleasant shea butter smell. They don’t smell like shea butter at all, and the moistuzing power is so-so. They also have alcohol pretty high in the ingredients list, which doesn’t impress me in skincare, and even less in something meant to moisturize. \n\n\n**The Face Shop Rich Hand V Special Care**    \n**Purchased:** Ebay for around $3.50    \n**Ingredients:** Water, dimethicone, butylene glycol, glycerin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citrus paradis (grapefruit) extract, glyceryl sterate, peg-100 sterate, urea, cetearyl alcohol, alcohol, sorbitan sesquioleate, cyclopentasiloxane, sodium polyacrylate, acrylates/C10-20 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, hydrogenated polydecene, potassium hydroxide, dimethiconol, adenosine, trideceth-6, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol, fragrance    \n**Experience:** These have a much milder grandma scent than the others, further mitigated with a pleasant base note of shea or cocoa butter smell, which is weird since they don’t contain either. They were the juiciest feeling hand mask I tried, and I had high hopes for them. Unfortunately, they did virtually nothing. I was honestly amazed at how ineffectual these were for moisturizing, and I can only guess the difference between this and the other masks I tried is due to the dimethicone so high in the ingredients list and lack of more effective moisturizing oil, at least for my skin. \n",

    "body": "Peach & Lily - Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream\n\nAnother eye cream review...from someone that should not be reviewing eye creams.\n\nReally though, I need to stop buying eye specific skincare and I think the Peach & Lily Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream will be the last one (at least for a good long while).\n\nI’m lucky enough that I don’t (yet) tackle many of the issues that eye products are meant to address. I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nsx4ky6ob6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=286e4316987d70bf7911feacbd7c512e74369313",

    "body": "You may have heard of the Swiss brand, **La Prairie**. It is well-known for two reasons: history and price It's a really big name brand with a history, and **a price** point several times higher than many premium brands. In February, they released a new product **priced at $1,980**!!! Which is very expensive for 24 ml.  \n⠀  \n**So, what's inside**? I reached out to La Prairie for the full list of ingredients in this cocktail. They kindly answered and sent the full list (I'll put it at the end)\n\nThis is a quite impressive cocktail. I was initially skeptical about it, as I am about most highly-priced products. It is clear from the ads how much money and effort is invested in the product.  \n⠀  \nAs promised by the manufacturer, the product contains *a special mixture* of a couple of glycoproteins derived from yeast and *Lactobacillus*, *ginseng*, and *horsetail extracts*. It can be found in many La Prairie products. The distinctive component is *colloidal platinum*, and what’s even more interesting is the *mixture of growth factors* of plant origin. Plus, there’s a mixture of moisturizing ingredients (*amino acids, minerals, saccharides*). This is what a good anti-aging serum should look like.\n\nEven though the composition may look amazing, don’t let appearances be deceptive. The base of the composition is growth factors (plant) and good old Matrixil, and there are other cocktails containing this type of base which are as efficient, and much cheaper.\n\nLooking at the packaging of the product, it looks as if it’s worth even more than the 24ml product itself! \n\nI wouldn’t mind having this cocktail in my routine, but not at this price. Would you buy this product?\n\n\\---- The ingredients list ----\n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, **Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract\\*, Lactobacillus Ferment\\*, Colloidal Platinum, Sodium Hyaluronate**, Argania Spinosa Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Rosa Rugosa Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Extract, **Oligopeptide-6, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Nicotiana Benthamiana Octapeptide-30 SH-Oligopeptide-2, Nicotiana Benthamiana Hexapeptide-40 SH-Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-10, Decapeptide-4**, Arginine, Threonine, Lysine HCL, Histidine, Serine, Glycine, Tryptophan, Soluble Collagen, Chitosan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Sodium Mannose Phosphate, Mannose, Folic Acid, Calcium Pantothenate, Propanediol, Cellulose, Isomalt, Phospholipids, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glucose, Xanthan Gum, Tin Oxide, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethylhexylglycerin, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Phosphate, Polysorbate 80, Sodium Oleate, Cysteine, Benzotriazolyl Dodecyl P-Cresol, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Ext.

Thats $200 a month for a product that is backed by countless studies and is still 1/10 of what you would pay at an antiaging clinic. Its very easy to find. If you can't afford that then spend $50 a month on injectable ipamorelin and sermorelin which is basically poor man's HGH. Anti aging clinics carry both of these but you will pay $250 min per month.",

    "body": "I've been using the **Sulwhasoo Snowise EX UV Protection Cream** for a month now, and I've really enjoyed it, so I thought I would share my experience with you all!\n\n**Product Claims:** According to it's [website](https://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/products/skin_care/snowise_ex_uv_protection_cream.html), this cream is \"a dual-functioning (Brightening, UV protection) cream promotes skin clarification while simultaneously preventing future damage from harmful UV rays.\" It's main purpose is to brighten and UV protection.\n\n**Sun Protection:** Although it's not directly listed, it is SPF47 PA+++. It's a broad spectrum sunscreen covering UVA and UVB. As far as I know, this is a chemical sunscreen, but please contradict me if I'm wrong!\n\n**Cost:** This was given to me as a gift, but it's $65.57 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sulwhasoo-Snowise-Protection-Cream-Fluid/dp/B00C6JZNYQ)\n\n**Notable Ingredients:** White Ginseng Saponin. [cosDNA here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0310137472.html) \n\n**Smell:** It has a sweet gingery, faint lemony smell, like all the other Snowise products. It does not smell like alcohol.\n\n**Experience:** So prior to receiving this wonderful gift, I was using Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence. The *Sulwhasoo Snowise EX UV Protection Cream* has been a pleasure to use.  And it doesn't smell like alcohol like the Biore. It's a white cream with a rich texture and it goes on white at first, but disappears into a brightening effect in a couple of minutes. I really like that it has both *Panax Ginseng Root Extract* AND *Hydrolyzed Ginseng Saponins* which are suppose to help with anti-aging and wrinkle care. It provides amazing moisture and hydration, and because it's summer, I use this cream as an occlusive after my serums and essences. It keeps my face moist and dewy all day long. I've also noticed that it has improved my skin texture. Compared to Biore, the SPF is only 47, and PA+++ instead of PA++++. My only other complaint would be that repurchasing it would be pretty costly.\n\n**Has anyone else used this cream? What was your experience?**\n\n",

    "body": "# Eco Your Skin VOLUFILINE15 Essence\n\nI bought this product off Peach and Lily as part of their Korean Anti\\-Aging Essentials Regimen Kits.\n\n* Cost: $70\n* Website Marketing Blurb: \"Plump up fine lines and crow's feet in the delicate eye area with this luxurious silky gel. Glutathione and peptides help promote collagen production so skin retains more bounce and elasticity. In addition to lessening the look of crow's feet, this potent anti\\-ager also addresses under\\-eye wrinkles, lid creases, forehead and neck lines, thanks to 15&#37; volufiline and polylactic acid. The lightweight texture is the perfect primer under makeup to visibly blur imperfections. Additionally, it helps prevent concealer or foundation from creasing and caking which can draw attention to lines and wrinkles.\"\n* Ingredients: Water,Butylene Glycol,Glycerin,Cyclopentasiloxane,Dimethicone Crosspolymer,Hydrogenated Polyisobutene,Anemarrhena Asphodeloides Root Extract,Niacinamide,Isohexadecan,Polyglyceryl\\-4 Caprate,1,2\\-Hexanediol,Glutathione,Polylactic Acid,Hydrolyzed Collagen,Sodium Hyaluronate,Acrylates/C10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Arginine,Sodium Polyacrylate,Caprylyl Glycol,Sorbitan Sesquioleate,Nicotinoyl Tripeptide\\-1,Palmitoyl Pentapeptide\\-4,Caffeoyl sh\\-Octapeptide\\-4,Caffeoyl Tripeptide\\-1,sh\\-Octapeptide\\-4,sh\\-Decapeptide\\-9,sh\\-Pentapeptide\\-19,Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract,Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract,Morus Alba Bark Extract,Panax Ginseng Root Extract,Panax Ginseng Root Extract,Allantoin,Ethylhexylglycerin,Adenosine,Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,Geranium Maculatum Oil,Pentylene Glycol,Aspalathus Linearis Extract,Caramel,CI 14700,CI 19140\n* Size: 50ml/1.69oz\n\nHere's a [comparison picture](https://imgur.com/6jm1Uc4) of the Eco Your Skin VOLUFILINE15 Essence (50ml/1.69oz) to Brickles Men's Products Restoring Eye Balm (14ml/0.5oz) and NYX Dark Circle Concealer Correcteur (2.9ml/(0.1oz). Clearly, the bottle of VOLUFILINE15 is huge in comparison, so you do get your money's worth. It's easily as big as some serum bottles. It's as big as my Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence bottle, which is also 50ml.\n\n* Texture: It's thick, more like a rich serum, with a condensed petroleum/Aquaphor feel without the greasiness. It's more upscale, refined and luxurious in texture than that. \"Silky?\" Perhaps. But you do have to spend some time patting it in. I actually pat it on then use a rolling motion with my ring finger along my eye area from the inside of my eye toward the outer corners until it absorbs, and it will absorb. Once it does, I find it has excellent grip to it and makes a fantastic primer for concealer afterward. I use a mineral powder as my concealer, and I used to have trouble with it caking into my finer lines and making the skin look cakey and dry. This keeps it from doing that. The powder sits on it flawlessly and stays there. It definitely prolongs the wear of it.\n* Skin Issues: None so far. I've combo skin that's extremely reactive, red, sensitive and prone to acne if I use the wrong products, which is 80&#37; of them. I've had no breakouts with this and no reactions to it.\n* Results: After a month of continuous use, my whole eye area looks brighter. I suffer from redness, and that's diminished significantly. The dark smudges beneath my lower lashes have faded quite a bit. My under eye area looks firmer, less puffy. The skin under my eyes no longer has the crepey texture it was starting to get. (That might have gone away with any good eye cream. I hadn't been moisturizing that area at all.) I have problems with red half circles along the bottom of my eye area. Genetic. Probably from too translucent or thin skin that shows some broken capillaries beneath. It's something I'd probably need serious treatment to get rid of. The redness used to creep up to the inner corners of my eyes, especially on my left eye. This has made this less noticeable, puffy and chased some of that redness away from the inner corners of my eyes, especially on the left side.\n* Overall: I'm happy with the purchase. I've no idea when I'll use the whole bottle. It's enormous. I paid $70 for it, but the fact it's so big means I won't be purchasing another eye cream any time soon. So the 2\\-3 eye creams I might have to purchase to get the same quantity of product would probably equal an equivalent amount of money. It feels luxurious and like a real treat to use. I've never been impressed with eye creams. They always felt like glorified moisturizers to me before. But this feels like serious eye cream mojo. ",

I've been using this cream as my daily foundation for over a year and adored it for being lightweight, providing good coverage, and not causing breakouts on my very sensitive skin. Ran out a week ago and noticed a packaging change when picking up my new tube. The feel of the cream is noticeably different and I've started breaking out badly. Reviews on NYX's site, Ulta, and Amazon all confirm that this reaction is pretty across-the-board. Seems there might be a few of the old-formula tubes floating around, so grab them if you see them!

The new one had poor coverage, made me ridiculously oily, and gave me cystic acne. I have tried so many products to try to replace it. The closest dupe I've found is Sephora's bright future skin tint. I was using nyx bb cream in the lightest shade nude and and shade no. 7 (light ivory) in the skin tint worked well for me. It didn't quite blend in to my skin as easily as the old nyx bb, but I started using a damp beauty blender with it with better results. Other products that were pretty close - wet n wild mega cushion foundation (light ivory) and CYO lifeproof foundation (shade 101). Unfortunately, I think these products may have been breaking me out slightly so I stopped using them. And if it helps, my skin type is pretty dry and flaky, especially around the nose and t-zone, but I also get oily around the forehead and cheeks by the end of the day. Hope this helps someone out there with the same struggles!",

    "body": "So far I co-washed two times.\n\nFirst time I did it the lush way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage, wash, put significant amount of conditioner on hair from roots to ends, wait, wash. The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

Simple. \n\nIf you are switching to low poo products and just using those, I would say it’s probably a bit of waxiness from transition. That’s normal and just a matter of lifting the waxiness (apple sauce mask, egg, or a full-poo shampoo) and forging ahead.  If you’re still using full poo products (which it looks like you are, regardless of how you’re using them) it’s probably just a bad formulation for you and/or the water coming out of your tap.   Find something inexpensive to try.  Burt’s Bees, L’Oreal Paris Evercurl or Evercreme cleansing conditioners, Nature’s Gate, VO5 conditioners in the white bottles (if they’re still packaged the same as when this list was made) are all fairly widely-available and often fairly inexpensive options.",

Red ginseng contains more “noble” or rare ginsenosides which may be the effects you are looking for. Another brand you can try is Terry Naturally HRG80 ginseng.

I've heard recently about the many benefits of ginseng root extract, and to that end, the difference in quality -- specifically, how there's a gradient of sorts that's heavily regulated, which, from some more reading, got Beauty of Joseon into hot water due to using an inferior version.\n\nThe big hitters I've seen for ginseng have been Donginbi and Sulwhasoo, but both have fragrance, and a lot of it such that some people are turned off _specifically_ by such ingredients! I know there's INCIDecoder's Advanced Search for filtering _with_ ginseng root and _without_ fragrance or alcohol, but that leaves me much in the same boat as those who used Beauty of Joseon and thought they were getting the real deal, only to be left in the lurch instead.\n\nAs such, do there exist true / high quality ginseng _anything_ without fragrance or alcohol? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much!",

    "body": "Anyone care to share any anecdotes about taking panamax or the ginseng root extract? Anyone using it for an immune system boost?\n\nI'm getting them to help with stress and to blunt stress-induced cortisol mediated immunosuppression, and also for general anxiolysis. I'm also getting it because some claim that it can help with babesia due to its arginase inhibition, but I haven't had much time to look into that yet. Has anyone on here looked into that, or even the general immunomodulatory effects of ginseng?\n  \nAnything else I should know about it? I haven't had much time to look into Schisandra yet either. From what I understand it's essentially functioning similarly to piperine, inhibiting CYP450 enzymes thereby reducing first pass metabolism by the liver. \n\nAny input is welcomed. I'd really like to hear some experience reports though.  \n  \nEdit: something I doubt that anyone will be able to answer but I am curious of: I know the ND website says that the active metabolites in ginseng bind to the cortisol receptors, but have significantly weaker activation. I'm wondering if I will have a net lower activation of cortisol, thereby reducing stress-induced immunosuppression, or if, for example, I had a way to predict that I was going to have a day with absolutely zero stress, if taking the ginseng extract would be slightly counterproductive in the way of having a net activation of cortisol receptors that is greater than I would have on a completely stressed free day.",

        "body": "Answering your last question on Ginseng leaf extract and zero stress days; some small baseline amount of cortisol interaction on your cortisol receptors is necessary to have motivation to function so you can accomplish your daily tasks. Take away that baseline stimulus and you will struggle with apathy & demotivational syndrome. You will be listless.\n\nGinseng Leaf extract is perfect for both zero stress days and high stress days as well. It is a weak partial agonist of the cortisol receptor which gives you the essential baseline stimulus you need to function. On high stress days when you have a high level of cortisol being dumped in your bloodstream, ginseng leaf extract will block this excess cortisol from binding to the receptors and causing damaging physiological responses (it will work as a strong cortisol receptor antagonist).\n\nSo I would use it with the peace of mind that it will cover you on both ends of the spectrum giving a motivational push on lazy stress-free days and a shield of protection on crazy stress filled days. Drama is not your friend, it’s bad for you physically.\n\nGinseng Leaf extract is such a weak cortisol agonist that it will have zero immunosuppression effects on lazy carefree days and will strongly protect you from immunosuppression by acting as a cortisol receptor antagonist on frenetic days when your adrenals are dumping boat loads of cortisol into your bloodstream.\n\nGinseng Leaf extract accomplishes this dual role because it has a much higher binding affinity for the cortisol receptor than the hormone cortisol but has a very weak agonist affect on the receptor resulting in a low level signal from the receptor.",

    "body": "I asked about the info on this label a few days ago and someone suggested that I just Google each ingredient. I did that and here's what I found if anyone is interested.\n\nThe info here is all pretty basic, most of it copied and pasted from various sources, but its more info than I had a few days ago. \n\nThank you!\n\n**Nutrition Facts**\n\nServing size: 8 fl. oz. (240 mL)\n\nServings Per Container 2\n\n___\n\nAmount per serving\n\n**Calories** 0\n\n**Total Fat** 0g (0%)\n\n**Sodium 180mg** (8%)\n\n**Total Carbohydrate** 1g (0%)\n\nSugars 0g\n\n**Erythritol** 1g - Erythritol ((2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol) is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) that has been approved for use as a food additive in the United States and throughout much of the world. In general, erythritol is free of side effects in regular use. Doses over 50 grams (1.8 oz) can cause a significant increase in nausea and stomach rumbling (borborygmi). Rarely, erythritol can cause allergic hives (urticaria).\n\nWhen compared with other sugar alcohols, it is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol, or lactitol.\n\n**Protein** 0g\n\n___\n\n**Niacin** 100% - Niacin (also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NO2 and, depending on the definition used, one of the 20 to 80 essential human nutrients.\n\nNot enough niacin in the diet can cause nausea, skin and mouth lesions, anemia, headaches, and tiredness. Chronic Niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra. \n\nHowever, too much is also bad. Pharmacological doses of niacin (1.5 - 6 g per day) lead to side effects that can include dermatological conditions such as skin flushing and itching, dry skin, and skin rashes including eczema exacerbation and acanthosis nigricans. \n\n**Vitamin B6** 100% - The primary role of vitamin B6 is to act as a coenzyme to many other enzymes in the body that are involved predominantly in metabolism. \n\nThere were lots of fancy words here I didnt get, but I get the feeling its to help you metabolize sugar and to give your body quicker, more immediate access to the energy in the drink.\n\n**Vitamin B12** 100% - Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis (especially odd chain fatty acids) and energy production.\n\nThe dietary reference intake for an adult ranges from 2 to 3 µg per day (USA), and 1.5 µg per day (UK). 1 µg = 1e-6g. Seriously, you need very little...\n\nHowever, Vitamin B12 deficiency can potentially cause severe and irreversible damage, especially to the brain and nervous system. At levels only slightly lower than normal, a range of symptoms such as fatigue, depression, and poor memory may be experienced.\n\nVitamin B12 deficiency can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis.\n\n**Pantothenic Acid** 100% - Also called pantothenate or vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a water-soluble vitamin. For many animals, pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient. Animals require pantothenic acid to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This metabolic function is probably why its in the drink.\n\nA normal adult male/female (14yo+) needs 5mg/day. \n\nDeficiency of this acid is so rare that it has not been thoroughly studied. Toxicity of pantothenic acid is unlikely. In fact, no Tolerable Upper Level Intake (UL) has been established for the vitamin. Large doses of the vitamin, when ingested, have no reported side effects and massive doses (e.g., 10 g/day) may only yield mild intestinal distress, and diarrhea at worst. It has been suggested, however, that high doses of pantothenic acid might worsen panic attacks in those with panic disorder by prolonging the duration until adrenal exhaustion.\n\n___\n\nIngredients:\n\n**Carbonated Water** - Unflavoured carbonated water erodes tooth enamel, though the effect is negligible.\n\nIntake of carbonated beverages has not been associated with increased bone fracture risk in observational studies, and the net effect of carbonated beverage constituents on the amount of calcium in the body is negligible. Carbonated water eases the symptoms of indigestion (dyspepsia) and constipation, according to a study in the European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology.\n\nA 2004 article in the Journal of Nutrition found that fizzy waters with higher sodium levels reduced cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular problems in postmenopausal women.\n\n**Citric Acid** - Seems like it's mostly for flavor, preservative, and it plays a role in the metabolism.\n\n**Erythritol** - See above.\n\n**Taurine** - Taurine is actually a naturally occurring organic acid and is widely distributed in animal tissue. It accounts for 0.1% of your total body weight. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Also serves a few other roles. For example, it acts as an antioxidant and has also been shown to help people with congestive heart failure by increasing the force and effectiveness of heart-muscle contractions.\n\nTaurine is involved in a number of crucial physiological processes. However, the role of taurine in these processes is not clearly understood and the influence of high taurine doses on these processes is uncertain.It may also be necessary to take into consideration that absorption of taurine from beverages may be more rapid than from foods.\n\n**Sodium Citrate** - Food additive. Sodium citrate is sometimes used as an acidity regulator in drinks.\n\n**Benzoic Acid** (Preservative) - \n\n**Caffeine** - Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant. Consumption of 1000–1500 mg per day (a Rockstar contains 240mg per can) is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant physical and mental conditions including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and heart palpitations after caffeine use.\n\nCaffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90). This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500 mg at a time). \n\nThe symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.\n\nIn cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.\n\nExtreme overdose can result in death. The median lethal dose (LD50) given orally is 192 milligrams per kilogram in rats. The LD50 of caffeine in humans is dependent on individual sensitivity, but is estimated to be about 150 to 200 milligrams per kilogram of body mass or roughly 80 to 100 cups of coffee for an average adult, or 300 cups of coffee for an adult living in the year 3000.\n\n**Acesulfame Potassium** - Acesulfame potassium is a calorie-free sugar substitute (artificial sweetener), also known as Acesulfame K or Ace K (K being the symbol for potassium), and marketed under the trade names Sunett and Sweet One.\n\nAs with other artificial sweeteners, there is concern over the safety of acesulfame potassium. However, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved their general use. Critics say acesulfame potassium has not been studied adequately and may be carcinogenic, although these claims have been dismissed by the FDA  and by equivalent authorities in the European Union.\n\nResearch suggests that acesulfame K may affect prenatal development. One study appeared to show that acesulfame K is ingested by mice through their mother's amniotic fluid or breast milk, and that this influences the adult mouse's sweet preference.\n\nAdditional research on the effects of acesulfame K on mice revealed that chronic use over a period of 40 days resulted in a moderate but limited effect on neurometabolic function. These results suggest that chronic usage of acesulfame K may lead to impairment of cognitive function.\n\n**Glucuronolactone** - Glucuronolactone is a naturally occurring chemical that is an important structural component of nearly all connective tissues. Glucuronolactone is rapidly absorbed and metabolized into non-toxic metabolites such as xylulose. In addition, humans may be able to use glucuronolactone as a precursor for ascorbic acid synthesis.\n\nGlucuronolactone is a popular ingredient in energy drinks with claims that it detoxifies the body. Although levels of glucuronolactone in energy drinks can far exceed those found in the rest of the diet, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded that exposure to glucuronolactone from regular consumption of energy drinks is not a safety concern. The no-observed-adverse-effect level of glucuronolactone is 1000 mg/kg/day. (Rockstar contains 100 mg per can.)\n\n**Sucralose** - Sucralose is an artificial sweetener. The majority of ingested sucralose is not broken down by the body, so it is noncaloric.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Diabetes Association, the amount of sucralose that can be consumed over a person's lifetime without any adverse effects is 9 milligrams per day per kilogram of body weight.\n\n**Sorbic Acid** (Preservative) - Sorbic acid, or 2,4-hexadienoic acid, is a natural organic compound used as a food preservative. The LD50 value of sorbic acid is estimated between 10-7.4 g/kg, which is quite high. The compound is relatively unstable and is rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is often considered environmentally friendly.\n\n**Pantothenic Acid** - See above.\n\n**Niacinamide** - Nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide and nicotinic amide, is the amide of nicotinic acid (vitamin B3 / niacin). Nicotinamide is a water-soluble vitamin and is part of the vitamin B group. Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is converted to nicotinamide in vivo, and, though the two are identical in their vitamin functions, nicotinamide does not have the same pharmacological and toxic effects of niacin, which occur incidental to niacin's conversion. Thus nicotinamide does not reduce cholesterol or cause flushing, although nicotinamide may be toxic to the liver at doses exceeding 3 g/day for adults.\n\n**Inositol** - Inositol and some of its mono and polyphosphates function as the basis for a number of signaling and secondary messenger molecules. They are involved in a number of biological processes, including:\n\nInsulin signal transduction, \n\nCytoskeleton assembly, \n\nNerve guidance (Epsin), \n\nIntracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration control, \n\nCell membrane potential maintenance, \n\nBreakdown of fats and reducing blood cholesterol, \n\nGene expression.\n\nSome preliminary results of studies on high-dose inositol supplements show promising results for people suffering from problems such as bulimia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), agoraphobia, and unipolar and bipolar depression.\n\nAccording to research, foods containing the highest concentrations of myo-inositol (including its compounds) include fruits, beans, grains and nuts.\n\n**Natural Flavor** - Flavors naturally.\n\n**Milk Thistle Extract** - Traditional milk thistle extract is made from the seeds, which contain approximately 4–6% silymarin. The extract consists of about 65–80% silymarin (a flavonolignan complex) and 20–35% fatty acids, including linoleic acid.\n\nIn herbalism, it is used in cases of liver diseases (cirrhosis, jaundice and hepatitis), gallbladder disease, and is claimed to protect the liver against poisons.\n\nResearch suggests that milk thistle extracts both prevent and repair damage to the liver from toluene and/or xylene. Workers who had been exposed to vapors from toluene and/or xylene for 5–20 years were given either a standardized milk thistle extract (80% silymarin) or placebo for 30 days. The workers taking the milk thistle extract showed significant improvement in liver function tests (ALT and AST) and platelet counts vs. the placebo group.\n\nBeside benefits for liver disease, other unproven treatment claims include:\n\nLowering cholesterol levels\n\nReducing insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes who also have cirrhosis,\n\nReducing the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate cancers.\n\nClinical study has shown that liver function tests can be improved in active hepatitis patients.\n\nAlzheimer's Disease prevention or treatment.\n\n\n**Gum Arabic** - Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. \n\nGum arabic's mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins gives it the properties of a glue and binder which is edible by humans. Other substances have replaced it in situations where their toxicity is not an issue, as the proportions of the various chemicals in gum arabic vary widely and make it unpredictable. Still, it remains an important ingredient in soft drink syrups, \"hard\" gummy candies such as gumdrops, marshmallows, M&M's chocolate candies, and edible glitter, a very popular, modern cake-decorating staple. Also called acacia after the original source, gum arabic is used as an emulsifier and a thickening agent in icing, fillings, chewing gum and other confectionery treats.\n\n**Ester Gum** - Glycerol ester of wood rosin, also known as glyceryl abietate or ester gum, is an oil-soluble food additive (E number E445). The food-grade material is used in foods, beverages, and cosmetics to keep oils in suspension in water.\n\n**Pyridoxine Hydrochloride** - Pyridoxine is one of the compounds that can be called vitamin B6, along with pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. \n\nVitamin B6 assists in the balancing of sodium and potassium as well as promoting red blood cell production. It is linked to cardiovascular health by decreasing the formation of homocysteine. Pyridoxine may help balance hormonal changes in women and aid the immune system. Lack of pyridoxine may cause anemia, nerve damage, seizures, skin problems, and sores in the mouth.\n\n**Panax Ginseng Root Extract** -  Folk medicine attributes various benefits to oral use of American ginseng and Asian ginseng (P. ginseng) roots, including roles as an aphrodisiac, stimulant, type II diabetes treatment, or cure for sexual dysfunction in men.\n\nA common side effect of P. ginseng may be insomnia, but this effect is disputed. Other side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, nose bleeds, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and breast pain. Ginseng may also lead to induction of mania in depressed patients who mix it with antidepressants.\n\n**Guarana Seed Extract** - Guarana is a climbing plant in the maple family, Sapindaceae, native to the Amazon basin and especially common in Brazil.\n\nIn the United States, guarana has received the designation of \"generally recognized as safe\" by the American Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPreliminary research has shown guarana may affect how quickly the body perceives itself to be full. One study showed an average 5.1 kg (11.2 lb) weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate, guarana, and damiana, compared to an average one-pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days. Although inconclusive about specific effects due only to guarana, this study differs from another showing no effect on body weight of a formula containing guarana.\n\nGuarana extract reduced aggregation of rabbit platelets by up to 37 percent below control values and decreased platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid by 78 percent below control values. It is not known if such platelet action has any effect on the risk of heart attack or ischemic stroke.\n\n**Caramel Color** - Caramel color or caramel coloring is a water soluble food coloring. Caramel color is a colloid. Though the primary function of caramel color is for coloration, it also serves additional functions. In soft drinks, it can function as an emulsifier to help inhibit the formation of certain types of \"floc\" and its light protective quality can aid in preventing oxidation of the flavoring components in bottled beverages.\n\nCalifornia has listed a compound formed in the manufacture of Class III and IV caramel colors in the state's Proposition 65,[17] which requires the Governor to publish, at least annually, a list of chemicals \"known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.\"\n\n**Cyanocobalamin** - Cyanocobalamin is the most common and widely produced of the chemical compounds that have vitamin activity as vitamin B12. \n\nThe oral use of cyanocobalamin may lead to several allergic reactions such as hives; difficult breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. Less-serious side effects may include headache, nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea, joint pain, itching, or rash.\n\n___\n\nIn Each Serving:\n\nTaurine 1000mg\n\nCaffeine 120 mg\n\nGlucuronolactone 50 mg\n\nInositol 25 mg.\n",

    "body": "i've been contemplating and over thinking this post for far too long now, i'm new to SCA and i have plenty of unrelated questions but i didn't want to spam the community, so for now i've decided to focus on this topic. i know i've procrastinated far too long but my birthday is next week and its my goal to start a skincare routine by then and to have the best skin i can have by then. here's my issues:\n\ni'm a 16 (soon to be 17) year old girl without a job and living in a low income family. i've been on SCA long enough to know that good skincare isnt cheap,  i don't have the money to but a $15 cleanser. idk why but i've been hesitant about starting a SCR probably because i'm fearful i'll do it wrong or the purging & potential for a product not agreeing with me will be too much to handle. i have a lot of new mini kits that i got for christmas and i thought i'd ask for your guy's reviews on these products (because i haven't seen anyone post on most of these yet) and your recommendations for me on creating a routine with what i currently have instead of going out and buying some the the HG products of this community. \n\nfirst, here's some history of my skin:\ni've known about skincare since i was about 11 from watching yt, before that i had did nothing but let water hit my face in the shower. at first i went to walmart and target trying any product that interested me and was cheap. i never stuck to a routine and to this day i've never consecutively washed my face for more than 5 days. the good news is in the last couple of years i've been educating myself more and watching out for certain ingredients and staying away from harmful products. i know i probably sound crazy to you all but i've never even used sunscreen. thankfully, it seems as if i'm crazy blessed because i've never had bad skin issues or a lot of acne, in the last 2 years though my skin has been the worst i've seen it, i don't really know how to rate it because sometimes i look at my skin and think \"ah its not that bad it's practically clear\" and other times, especially when i'm wearing makeup or in good lighting i'm thinking \"goodness, my skin is awful\". my main issue are blackheads on my nose, texture all over my face especially on my forehead (but pretty much unnoticeable unless you're up close or in good/dim lighting), whiteheads on my chin, and a few persistent zits on my cheeks and a few others that pop up here and there. \n\nnow to the products. i'm going to list all of the products i've accumulated and not used recently, most of them are sample sizes from gift sets. my request is for you to give me a mini review on any of the products you've tried and from the skin issues i've relayed for you to tell me what you'd suggest my routine to be with the products i have. if you need anymore information please let me know, and i apologize if i've one anything wrong or worded things weird i'm new to this site and new to skincare at this level.

Skincare actually doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, there are many companies for example, The Ordinary that are making great products that are inexpensive. \n\nYour lucky you don’t really have acne prone skin so here’s the routine I’d recommend to you for blackhead:\n\nAM:\nGentle cleanser - I’d recommend CeraVe ($10.98)  \n\n\nSerum/Acids: For blackheads Id recommend - The Ordinary Niacinimide 10% + zinc 1% as its gentle and is known to un-clog pores. Here, you could alternate and  use The Ordinarys Salicylic Acid 2% Solution.\n\nMoisturizer \n\nSunscreen daily \n\nPm: \n\nCleanse with same gentle cleanser\n\nExfoliate 2-3 times per week - I’d recommend The Ordinary  Glycolic Acid 7% Toner \n\nSerums/Acids: Here you can use either the salicylic acid or Niacinamide again. Or you can use one of these in the morning and one at night but don’t mix them together. \n\nMoisturize",

I think the best thing for you would be to pick a cleanser and moisturizer now and then swap them out for your others if it's not working for you. \n\n**Cleanser** (Morning and night, pick one to start with, then swap it out for another one. If none of them cause breakouts, you can just alternate which one you use)   \n\n- e.l.f. daily face cleanser w/ purified water\n- philosophy purity made simple (this one is moisturizing)\n- fresh soy face cleanser (this one is mild and a good one to start with)\n\n**Deep Cleanser** (I would probably only use this 1-2 a week in place of your regular cleanser because they seem more harsh on your skin. I would wait to start these after you get used to a daily cleanser)  \n\n- pacifica kale detox deep cleaning face wash\n- purity the microdelivery exfoliating facial wash\n\n**Serum**\n\n- caudalie vinoperfect radiance serum \n\n**Moisturizers** (Pick one and use it morning and night) \n\n- pacifica dreamy youth day and night face cream\n- philosophy renewed hope in a jar (this one has great reviews, maybe start here)\n- caudalie vinosource moisturizing sorbet \n\n**Occlusive** (use this at night for dehydrated skin, damaged moisture barrier)  \n\n- Vaseline (You might already had this at home so you don't have to buy more things)\n- Facial oil (if you have olive oil, sunflower seed, argan oil, jojoba oil, etc, it might be a good place to start.) \n\n**DIY Masks** (You can make nice masks with stuff you might already have at home)  \n\n- Ground up oatmeal + honey + yogurt/milk. This makes my skin really moisturized and glowy. \n- plain yogurt or milk makes my skin look brighter and less dull\n- honey + green tea leaves\n- Turmeric powder. Add this to any of the above masks for a nice glow to your skin. (Skip if you're very pale because it might be too yellow) \n\n**Products to Try in the future**\n\n- Stridex pads in red box. It's ~$7 and the salicylic acid will help with your minor acne problems. \n- Sunscreen   \nI would highly recommend getting sunscreen or start wearing ball caps if you're out in the sun.

    "body": "A little bit of background info: I haven't had a grand mal seizure since 2014 and I've been off meds since 2015. I've had some close calls but none as close as this one. Whenever I'm about to have a seizure, first I'll get really dizzy and if I sit down or lie down in time I can prevent it from happening. If my right arm twitches that's how I know it's a lost cause.\n\nI had the seasonal Mountain Dew Flavor Dew-S-A on Sunday and after drinking a whole can while sitting down I stood up and instantly felt incredibly dizzy as if I was going to have a seizure. I sat down and I was down for about 5 hours, whereas normally I can feel better after 1-2 hours. My normal triggers are things like physical stress and exhaustion (potentially heat or humidity) and none of that was going on so I was really struggling to find out what the problem was.\n\nMonday I was pretty much in bed the first half of the day still feeling pretty dizzy. Tuesday I had another can and was sitting down the whole time, but a couple hours afterward I stood up and felt it again although not as bad. Wednesday I took a few sips of one as I was walking around the house and was getting pretty dizzy from that, which is when I started to suspect it. Drank a can of Dr. Pepper and felt no dizziness from that, so I compared the ingredients.\n\nThere are a lot of ingredients in the Dew-S-A that weren't in the Dr. Pepper so it could be a variety of things. I compared it to the Frostbite Mountain Dew Flavor and the only difference was that Dew-S-A had Panax Ginseng and Ginseng Root Extract in it, so I figured if I drank the Frostbite today and didn't feel any dizziness that was probably the cause. About 2 hours after drinking it now I still feel just as fine as I did beforehand, which was still a little bit dizzy from the aftermath but nothing extra like had been in the past.\n\nI asked my friend who is a studying pharmacist and a pharmacy tech if he knew what was going on with it and here is what he had to say:\n\n*\"Caffeine in combination with panax ginseng can stimulate the central nervous system which may include increased neurotransmission with glutamate receptors which is suspected to cause epilepsy ... I wouldn't recommend combining panax ginseng and caffeine together.\"*\n\nHe's a pretty dang healthy dude and mentioned that when he takes panax ginseng and adds caffeine to it he sometimes gets light headed as well and the comedown can be a bit rough.\n\nBottom line is that it's worth staying away from if you are prone to seizures and maybe even if your triggers are similar to mine. As we all know, everything is different for everyone, but I figured that if I could at least warn some people about this it might help :)\n\nI was honestly just surprised to see that in a soda, because most of the time ginseng is found in things like green tea and energy drinks, whereas normal 12oz sodas typically just have caffeine in them. Just remember to be wary and keep yourself healthy!",

Furthermore, you can easily use it sublingually due to its rapid absorption and mild taste. The effects of GS15-4 ginseng are balanced but lean towards the energizing side of the spectrum and provide a subtle mood-brightening effect.  \n>  \n>Our ginseng root extract, on the other hand, leans more towards the calming side of the spectrum. The Panax ginseng root extract, provides an uplifting yet calming effect that can melt stress away while providing a stable and happy mood. The Panax ginseng leaf extract, however, is the complete polar opposite of the Panax ginseng root extract and the GS15-4 ginseng extract, and acts more like a stimulant than the other Panax ginseng extracts. The Panax ginseng leaf became a favorite among those looking for some added energy, clarity and motivation. That being said, it sacrificed the stress support and balancing effects of the Panax ginseng root extract and the GS15-4 ginseng extract. Instead of providing a gentle lift, the ginseng leaf extract is a little bit pushier and brings on a more abrupt increase in mood. This is when we decided to investigate exactly what we were extracting with each extract and below are the results from this investigation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried GS15-4 and like it in combo with cordyceps, feels like nice motivation/stimulation. I generally like stimulants because I feel like motivation is my main obstacle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering how, anecdotally, Panamax feels compared to GS15-4.",

I recommend to do some more research to make sure it doesn't contain any ingredients associated with side-effects that you don't want to risk.\n\nSorry, I don't remember off the top of my head what the ingredient was named though.

I'm specifically mad because they added salicylic acid and I have a sensitivity to it. It is VERY hard to find a drugstore face wash without salicylic acid in it lol.\n\nAnyway, when I was on my mission to find a face wash with a similar formula to the old one, I wasn't able to find a summary of how the formula changed. I assume it's out there somewhere, but I didn't see it. So, if you're like me and want to know what they changed, here are the two ingredients lists:\n\nC&C Morning Burst OLD FORMULA (taken from the back label of my last physical bottle I had)-\n\nWater,\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nFragrance,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nDisodium EDTA,\nMethylparaben,\nMenthol,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nCitric Acid,\nIron Oxides,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nC&C Morning Burst NEW FORMULA (taken from C&C website)-\n\nWater,\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSodium Ascorbyl Phosphate,\nTocopheryl Acetate,\nMannitol,\nCellulose,\nHydroxypropyl Methylcellulose,\nIron Oxides,\nSodium Hydroxide,\nCitric Acid,\nDisodium EDTA,\nSalicylic Acid,\nMenthol,\nFragrance\n\nHere is a summary of the changes:\n\nWhat they added-\n\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate,\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine,\nSorbitol,\nSodium Hydrolyzed Potato Starch- Dodecenylsuccinate,\nAcrylates Crosspolymer-4,\nSalicylic Acid\n\nWhat they removed-\n\nSodium Laureth Sulfate,\nGlycerin,\nAcrylates Copolymer,\nCocamidopropyl Betaine,\nPhenoxyethenol,\nMenthyl Lactate,\nMethylparaben,\nPropylparaben,\nEthylparaben,\nCucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract,\nRetinyl Palmitate,\nPanax Ginseng Root Extract,\nZingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract,\nAcrylates/Ammonium Methacrylate Copolymer,\nTriethyl Citrate,\nCitrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Fruit Extract,\nTitanium Dioxide,\nMica,\nTalc\n\nI'm not a chemist so I'm not going to claim any of these changes to be good or bad or whatever, but if you found the new Morning Burst formula isn't working for you anymore, I think it's good to examine the ingredients lists.\n\nI will note that the first 5 ingredients (excluding water) in the new formula are all new additions, and that the first 4 ingredients in the old formula were all removed.\n\nSo, did I find a replacement? Maybe. Neutrogena's Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub's first 2 ingredients are the same as C&C MB's old formula (Glycerin and Sodium Laureth Sulfate). It also has the little exfoliating bits that I love, and NO salicylic acid. I haven't tried it yet, so this isn't an official recommendation, but the ingredients are giving me hope.\n\n(EDIT: After 3 weeks of using this new face wash, I do recommend the Neutrogena wash as a replacement specifically for C&C's Morning Burst. It has been working very well for me, personally.)\n\n(Side note: I'm not being paid by Neutrogena lol. I used this product's full government name because Neutrogena also has a product of a similar name with different ingredients. They were right next to each other at the store when I went. If in doubt, check the formula!)\n\nI hope that compiling this info is helpful for at least 1 person out there!",

I just bought some, and I was wondering if you had any tips on formulating with it.\n\nI'm by no means an expert, but a couple of thoughts on the mixture:\n\n- The measurements are in both ml and grams; I would probably just measure everything in grams, just to keep it consistent.\n\n- 200 ml of tea tree water seems like a lot, given that the other ingredients (except for argan and jojoba oil) add up to 37.3%. Assuming that the total mixture adds up to 300g, that would leave 188.1g for both the tea tree water and the oils.\n\n- In lotions that I've made, I've used about 10% oil, which has turned out pretty well. I didn't find it too greasy, but I think it depends a lot on the oil used and personal preference. Maybe you could try making a small test batch first (30g or less)? I've also made test base lotions, i.e., just water, oil, and emulsifier--no actives or extracts--just to get a sense of how the lotion would feel and how much emulsifier I need.\n\n- What is the emulsifier in the mixture? I see that the saccharomyces and the \"1st mixture\" have lecithin, but from what I've read, lecithin requires a co-emulsifier. See http://swiftcraftymonkey.blogspot.com/2013/02/question-how-to-use-lecithin-as.html.",

One study that surveyed people with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection found that 30% of them still had persistent symptoms after 9 months. Fatigue, brain fog and memory issues were among the list of common persistent symptoms. Obviously not everyone who gets SARS-CoV-2 also has it confirmed, so the numbers may be lower for pooled confirmed and unconfirmed infections. But even if you make very optimistic estimates, SARS-CoV-2 is a significant risk to your cognitive health. Vaccines are known to somewhat decrease your chances of getting infected, but they are very good at decreasing the severity of the damage done to your body when you do get an infection.\n\nIt's possible that the best thing you can do for your brain this year is to get vaccinated for covid-19.\n\nIf you are afraid of getting vaccinated more than you are afraid of getting a SARS-CoV-2 infection, please read through this [Vaccines FAQ](https://www.idsociety.org/covid-19-real-time-learning-network/vaccines/vaccines-information--faq/).

Luckily they have a 365-day return policy, but I'm not sure if I want to return _everything_ I have without investigating whether it's warranted first.Going through the ingredients, I noticed that in a large percentage of their products, it seems the only FA trigger* is/are  Polysorbates (20, 60, 80, etc). And this is not just the Ordinary. I found Polysorbates in about 60% of the other the products I own as well.\n\n**So my question is, since there are almost no products that are _100%_ FA safe, does the position of the FA triggering ingredient matter on the ingredients list, and when should it become concerning?

I've had issues with stuff that cosdna,sezia, etc deem \"perfect\", so I get it.)\n\nAs an example here are a couple products that I'm particularly bummed about giving up, where the polysorbates are at the end third of the ingredient list: Any thoughts?\n\n~~~~~\n\n**Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution**\n\nWater, Glycolic Acid, Rosa damascena flower water, Centaurea cyanus flower water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propanediol, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Aminomethyl Propanol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Aspartic Acid, Alanine, Glycine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, PCA, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Fructose, Glucose, Sucrose, Urea, Hexyl Nicotinate, Dextrin, Citric Acid, **Polysorbate 20**, Gellan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Chloride, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n-----------------\n\n**Ordinary BHA Salicylic Acid 2% Solution**\n\nWater, Hamamelis Virginiana Leaf Water, Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Salicylic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Citric Acid, **Polysorbate 20**, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ethoxydiglycol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, 1,2-hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n~~~~~\n\n* note: aside from  hydrogenated castor oil (which it seems they are slowly dropping from their formulas one by one)",

    "body": "TLDR; Do you trust the reviews on Beautypedia? What is your experience with rosewater and/ or The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% ? \n\nDoes rosewater really count as a fragrance or irritant? Have you found it to be irritating?\n\n=== Long read below (personal + sources) ====\n\nThough I've had to stop 4x wk usage of The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toner because of Differin .1% use, I still use this Glycolic toner about 3x a month (I just don't use Differin on those days). I'm also getting to the point where I am considering quitting Differin because it's not doing much for my closed comedones (the reason I went on it in the first place). My skin is oily and dehydrated, naturally. I'm still going to give it another month since I'm about 2.5 months in, but pretty sure I'm going to stop after that, in favor of 2-3x week BHA use and 3-4x week of my AHA of choice, The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7%. I like the 7% concentration, the hydration/firming I get from it, and find it much less drying than the 10% concentration I was using previously (Paula's Choice Liquid).\n\nANYWAY, I recently read a review of this product on Beutypedia. It got a pretty low rating (3/5) due to the Rosewater, which is the third ingredient and hexyl nicotinate, lower down on the ingredients list. Beautypedia reviewers are referred to as \"experts\". I don't think that they are dermatologists or chemists, though, otherwise that would be noted (wouldn't it?). They do often cite medical Journal articles to support their reviews, even though these can be misconstrued, though I'm not saying that I know this particular site does that. I refer to the site often, to see if they have anything  to add regarding certain products/ingredients that I can't get from user reviews. But.. obviously there's a little conflict of interest since this is a sister site to Paula Begoun's website, on which she sells her own products (she is also neither a chemist nor a dermatologist, rather a \"skin expert\" as well).\n\nThe conflict comes from a couple of other sources I've seen, that don't consider rosewater to be an irritant, it seems. Not only have I read a lot of reviews for rose water on this sub, I recently came across this article from Huffpo in which they cited a dermatologist's view on rose water (below). There Is also a WebMD entry in which rosewater and glycerin is indicated for skin irritations and even diaper rash for babies (also cited below). A top of that you have hundreds of beauty articles that rave about Rosewater in general ( though to be honest, I usually take articles written by beauty editors with a grain of salt, because they are often linked to affiliated or sponsored products.)\n\n========== BEAUTYPEDIA =========\n\nFrom Beautypedia:\n\n\"Although most products from The Ordinary are fragrance free, this AHA exfoliant contains a high amount of fragrant rosewater. This plant extract contains several beneficial components for skin, but it also contains fragrance ingredients known to irritate skin (Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences, July-August 2011).\n\nGlycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution also contains the ingredient hexyl nicotinate, which can trigger skin irritation and dilate blood vessels in skin (Skin Research and Technology, February 2003; and Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology, March-April 1998).\"\n\n========== HUFFPO ==========\n\nHuffpo article quotes:\n\n\"The fragrant liquid -- created through the steam distillation of rose petals -- has several beauty benefits that make it suitable for all skin types and conditions, according to Dr. Tabasum Mir, a skincare physician in cosmetic dermatology and cosmetic laser surgery. Often found in facial sprays, toners, moisturizers, makeup removers and masks, rosewater has ancient homeopathic roots dating as far back to ancient Egypt.\n\nMir highly recommends rosewater for people with sensitive skin or rosacea, because its anti-inflammatory properties help soothe irritation...; \"\n\n\"It's anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, has antioxidants and it hydrates -- four main reasons why it's so affective and can be used for so many reasons,\" says Mir. Vitamins A and C and the antioxidants found in this aromatic solution can also help repair sun damage and hydrate drier complexions. \"It's also good for those who are acne prone because people don't realize that acne is caused by bacteria on the surface of your skin,\" says Mir.\"...;\n\n\"While Mir says there are hardly any side effects of using rosewater, it can potentially irritate skin if mixed with other things such as drying alcohols or synthetic fragrances.\"\n[NOTE: TO's Glycolic toner contains no alcohol or added fragrance. Beautypedia seems to think that the rosewater IS the fragrance?]\n\n===== WEB M.D. (Glycerin and Rosewater) =========\n\n\"This medication is used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, itchy skin and minor skin irritations (e.g., diaper rash, skin burns from radiation therapy).\"\n\n========== Product Ingredients ==========\n\nAqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Propanediol, Glycerin, Triethanolamine, Aminomethyl Propanol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Aspartic Acid, Alanine, Glycine, Serine, Valine, Isoleucine, Proline, Threonine, Histidine, Phenylalanine, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, PCA, Sodium PCA, Sodium Lactate, Fructose, Glucose, Sucrose, Urea, Hexyl Nicotinate, Dextrin, Citric Acid, Polysorbate 20, Gellan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Chloride, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n========== Sources ========== \n\nhttps://www.beautypedia.com/products/glycolic-acid-7-toning-solution/\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/rosewater-skin-beauty-products_n_55e5b9bce4b0aec9f3547aff\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-160429/glycerin-and-rose-water-topical/details\n\nEdited: formatting, grammar",

If anyone has any further information on this then it would be interesting to look into it further. \n\nThe bill has an exception for\nProducts that contain caffeine and not a psychoactive substance.\nCaffeine isn't defined as a psychoactive substance because it's in the exceptions list.\n\nTea contains at least three other psychoactive substances, L-Theanine, Theophylline and Theobromine. I think many people find tea more relaxing and mood-enhancing than coffee, and part of that may be due to the effects of L-Theanine. It is definitely psychoactive, having many effects on the brain. It binds directly to glycine receptors and also increases levels of GABA and dopamine. It's effects can even be seen on an EEG. Theophylline and Theobromine are stimulants analogous to caffeine. \n\nThat seems to make tea illegal, very ironically in Britain of all places. It may make many energy drinks illegal too, as they contain taurine and ginseng root extract which are thought to be psychoactive to some extent. \n\nThe only way that tea might not be illegal is if it somehow is further excempted by being a food, but the bill is quite unclear in this regard. Both EU-approved foodstuffs and caffeine products are exempted, but it seems they're simultaneously not if they contain another psychoactive substance.\n\nPerhaps tea could be legal and illegal simultaneously, and that would show the stupidity of this whole thing. What are people's thoughts on this? Have I misunderstood the bill?",

I’m not seeing any lines or wrinkles in that area really...and the slight darkness/bagginess I have has been there since I was a tiny human.\n\nSo, I fear that any amazing benefits or results might be a bit lost on me. At least that seems to be the trend since no eye product I have tried has truly wowed me.\n\nWhat I do like about the Pure Peach Retinoic Eye Cream is that it features so many ingredients I love in a product that is lightweight and absorbs beautifully. Niacinamide, ginseng, bamboo, and several antioxidant rich greens are here.\n\nAlso, Bakuchiol is in the formulation which is said to be a more “natural” and gentle alternative to Retinol. From what I’ve read and heard from skincare professionals...we need more studies/research before making that claim with confidence.\n\nMy experience with this product is that it hydrates my eye area really well and plays nicely with the other products in my routine. That in addition to the nice dose of antioxidants makes this a fine product for me...I just can’t say for certain that it is doing much more than that.\n\nA little bit goes a really long way here so I’ll probably have this bottle in my routine for quite some time. But, I don't think it is something I would come back to...I guess the same could be said for all eye products (for now).\n\nLike I said...not the best person to be reviewing this one lol!\n\nFull Ingredients List: Water, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Bambusa (Bamboo) Textilis Stem Extract, Arctium Lappa (Burdock) Root Extract, Morus Alba (Mulberry) Leaf Extract, Prunus Persica (Peach) Fruit Extract, Bakuchiol, Rosa Rubiginosa Seed Oil, Daucus Carota (Carrot) Sativa Root Water, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Spinacia Oleracea (Spinach) Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Sorbitan Olivate, Lactuca Scariola Sativa (Lettuce) Leaf Extract, Ceramide Np, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ferulic Acid, Tocopherol, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Adenosine, Cetearyl Olivate, Hydrogenated Rapeseed Alcohol, Betaine, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyglyceryl-4 Oleate, Glyceryl Olivate, Glyceryl Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Asparagus Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Phosphoric Acid, Corallina Officinalis Extract\n\nWhere To Buy (Peach & Lily - $42.00 USD - 20ml): [https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/pure-peach-retinoic-eye-cream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ig98ynqhb6p51.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=59743d69739f7080a1dad8e134ce1867977ca1dc",

So, I decided to grab this one and find out more. Turns out…it really looked like something I would enjoy so I gave it a shot.\n\nThe Mask Material is a thin Cotton Style Mask Material that is very comfortable, cooling, and easy to apply. This Mask Material really clings to the Skin making for a super nice fit. The Essence is thin and watery…so I did see some drips taking it out of the package. The scent is slightly Ginseng-y…but there is Fragrance here that makes the scent more creamy/berry as well. It’s quite an interesting combo that I really liked.\n\nFeatured Ingredients include Hyaluronic Acid, Panthenol, Paper Mulberry Extract, Ginseng Root Extract, Skullcap Root Extract, Rosemary Flower Extract, Green Tea Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Licorice Root Extract, and Pearl Powder…just to name some highlights. There really is a whole array of “Hanbang Style” Extracts here that I was super excited to see.\n\nClaims of this Mask include hydration, nourishment, soothing/calming, and brightening. Pretty much the whole package! \n\nI was able to keep this Mask on for 20 minutes and after removal my Skin felt incredibly hydrated and soft. I was also impressed with the slight brightening/soothing effect that this Mask was able to provide. But overall…the hydrated and dewy glow that this Mask gave my Skin was the standout benefit.\n\nThis is totally one that I would consider coming back to and recommending…especially for those looking for a big hit of hydration with some extra benefits! \n\nWhere To Buy (Facetory - $3.00 USD):\n\n[https://www.facetory.com/products/lyajin-fermented-red-ginseng-moisturizing-sheet?\\_pos=1&\\_sid=8c7406f02&\\_ss=r](https://www.facetory.com/products/lyajin-fermented-red-ginseng-moisturizing-sheet?_pos=1&_sid=8c7406f02&_ss=r) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwpv3c9pbjo41.jpg?width=2316&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7829d5ee296f2a141d5a4a5baf22072eae9a97b3",

Have others experienced this? I have pretty sensitive skin, so this isn't the first time something like this has happened but, could this be an allergy to something in the product? \n\nIs there anything in the ingredients that is more likely to upset sensitive skin?

I'm currently sitting at 293 (6'1\" M) and think it will be easy to integrate into my current lifestyle. \n\nMy main question has to do with what is and isn't allowed during the fasting period. I use a powdered drink mix during the day and wanted to ask your opinion of whether or not I should be using it in the morning before I break my fast. \n\nIt's called GGSupps and has zero calories, carbohydrates and sugars. \n\n[Link to Product Page](https://gamersupps.gg/collections/gg/products/strawberry-burst-and-free-pink-shaker)\n\nIngredients list: Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Organic Caffeine, L-Theanine, L-Tyrosine, Astaxanthin, Acai Berry, Goji fruit extract, Ginseng Root Extract, Mangosteen Fruit Extract, Blueberry Fruit Juice\n\nAnyways, I'm excited to be part of the community and l am looking forward to achieving my goals in the coming year. \n\nThanks in advance!

Bergamot fruit oil (which may smell lovely) is an irritant and it's also problematically present in a large concentration. Same goes for The orange/lemon extract. There's also a bunch of citrus oils which pose issues as well. I see no pH adjusters, so that SA and lactic acid are not going to exfoliate.\n\nHawaiian face mask has limonene (a component of lavender oil which has some evidence in phototoxicity) and fragrance. Not sure how pineapple/papaya extract are in terms of being irritants. \n\nEven Advanced looks to be the best of the lot. Potential irritants are relegated to somewhere near the end of the list (fragrance is almost last which is great). The addition of several emollients and non-fragrant oils makes this a strange one though, as they hamper the absorbing effect of clay. If you have oily skin you probably won't find this to be effective, but for Normal/Dry it may be nice.",

    "body": "Hello, fellow migraineurs!\n\nOn the 20th I started a zero carb diet, partially to help with migraines. For the first two weeks I ate only meat and water. Then I tried adding a sugar free Monster (mixed 1:3 with sparkling water) and my head felt REALLY odd. Not quite full-blown migraine, but not good. This happened two days in a row, then I gave up trying that but did try coffee and separately something with sucralose, and no migraine resulted. Yesterday I had something with cheddar and had a migraine less than an hour later. \n\nOn the Monster...it doesn't seem to be the caffeine or the sucralose. Is anything else in the ingredients a common trigger? (Ingredients listed at the bottom of this post.)\n\nOn the cheddar, and the Monster, in general...in the last, in my quest to control the migraines I've done elimination diets and neither of these seemed to be an issue. I've done months with no dairy, and when I added the dairy back in there was no increase in migraines, nor a decrease while I was off it. I've had Monsters before with no perceptible impact on migraine, and periods of time when I'd completely abstain from soda/caffeine/sweeteners, etc, also with no apparent impact. \n\nIs there a mechanism in migraines that would make triggers show up more when most other factors are taken away? Like, is it likely that my system is used to being overwhelmed so it didn't really react with cheddar, but when I start to calm things down it has enough 'leisure' to be triggered by smaller things? Why would these cause migraines now but not previously?\n\nMonster ingredients: carbonated water, citric acid, erythritol, sodium citrate, natural and artificial flavors, panax ginseng root extract, taurine, sucralose, caffeine, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, acesulfame potassium, l-carnitine, l-tartrate, niacinamide, d-calcium pantothenate, sodium chloride, d-glucuronolactone, inositol, guarana seed extract, pyridoxine hydrochloride, maltodextrin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, maltodextrin, cyanocobalamin.",

It's not listed in that list, but when I looked online, it seems pretty much all the monster drinks have artifical colorings. I'm not sure which colors, I think red is a big one, but until I've narrowed it down even more, I'm steering clear of all. I now drink strictly water, tea, and clear, naturally sweetened drinks, like Zevia. I thought it was the caffeine in soda that was my problem, but it doesn't appear to be. Not unless I drink a ton of caffeine and then suddenly stop. I'll get a withdrawal migraine.",

    "body": "Hi SCA!\n\nI'm looking for just some general advice on my current routine. Please tell me what I could/should be doing differently. I have normal skin (not dry, not oily), I rarely ever have a break out of any kind...My main concern is making sure that I'm taking all the right steps as far as anti-aging goes. And also if any of the products I'm using are either ineffective or not good for skin. I have no known allergies. \n\nEvening:\n\n* Remove makeup with Pond's Cold Cream cleansers (the Pond's website just lists \"key ingredients\" as Mineral Oil and Beeswax)\n\n* Wash every evening with Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser. (Ingredients: Water, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, acrylates/steareth-20 methacrylate copolymer, glycerin, PEG-200 hydrogenated glyceryl palmate, sodium laureth sulfate, butylene glycol, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, phenoxyethanol, masking fragrance, panthenol, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, disodium EDTA, methylparaben.)\n\n* Exfoliate 2-3x a week with Lush's \"Let the Good Times Roll\". (Ingredients: Maize flour (Zea mays) , Glycerine , Talc , Water (Aqua) , Corn Oil (Zea mays) , Corn Meal (Zea Mays) , popcorn , Gardenia Extract (Gardenia jasminoides) , Cinnamon Powder (Cinnamomum cassia) , Fragrance)\n\n\n* Moisturize with Ole Henriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration (Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Glycerin, Squalane, Triheptanoin, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Candelilla/Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Ceramide 2, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Hydrolyzed Viola Tricolor Extract, Calcium Ascorbate, Rosa Canina Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Saccharum Officinarium (Sugar Cane) Extract, Acer Saccharinum (Sugar Maple) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Soybean Sterols, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Trehalose, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Vaccinium Myrtillus Extract, Sorbitol, Xanthan Gum, Potato Starch Modified, Sodium Phytate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Parfum/Fragrance)\n\n* Serum/Oil application with Fresh's Elixir Ancien. I actually only have this product because I was lucky enough to snag it for $5 at a QVC sample sale. It retails for well over $200 so I'm kind of hoping that if it is effective the active ingredients are more cheaply obtainable :) (Ingredients: LIMNANTHES ALBA (MEADOWFOAM) SEED OIL, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS (JOJOBA) SEED OIL, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT) GERM OIL, HIPPOPHAE RHAMNOIDES OIL, RIBES NIGRUM (BLACK CURRANT) SEED OIL, COMMIPHORA MYRRHA EXTRACT, ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS (ROSEMARY) LEAF EXTRACT, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, DIPALMITOYL, HYDROXYPROLINE, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PROPYL GALLATE, CITRIC ACID )\n\n\nMorning:\n\n* I generally skip washing my face in the morning. I take showers at night and after my whole evening routine I guess I don't feel dirty enough or whatever. Do let me know if this is a big no no.\n\n* I religiously apply Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock in SPF 70. It's the best sunscreen I've ever used for putting on under makeup. It has such a dry finish and doesn't interfere with my makeup application at all which is a huge plus. \n\n\n\nThanks so much for your help! Please let me know what if anything I should be doing and any age prevention products you recommend.\n",

People are reporting that when they take a pill that was created before the \"shortage\" they are feeling just fine and not having any of the negative symptoms.

    "body": "Hi curlies, I need some help troubleshooting. I feel like I have zero way to predict whether my scalp will like a shampoo or not; some with supposedly \"harsher\" ingredients work great for me and others that are \"gentler\" make me super dry and itchy! I have to stick to low-poo because my low-porosity, medium-thickness 2C hair gets weighed down really easily. I desperately want to experiment with new shampoos but I have no way of narrowing down which ones might work for me!!\n\nHere are some of the products I've tried, how my scalp liked them, and their ingredients.\n\nTHE BODY SHOP GINGER SHAMPOO - Somehow? this is the nicest of all the shampoos I've ever tried on my scalp?? I legitimately don't understand why, it's one of the only things that leaves my scalp feeling calm. I'd like to be able to use something else though because I know all the sulfates are probably really harsh on my curls.\n\nIngredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Piroctone Olamine, Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Gluconate, Dimethicone Propyl PGBetaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Sodium Salicylate, Salix Alba Bark Extract/Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Linalool, Limonene, Betula Alba Bark Extract, Zingiber Officinale Root Oil/Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Citronellol, Citral, Isopropyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, sr-Spider Polypeptide-1, 1,2- Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol\n\n-\n\nPANTENE NUTRIENT BLENDS COMPLETE CURL CARE SHAMPOO - Made me unbearably itchy, red and flaky. The worst of the bunch.\n\nIngredients: Water, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates Copolymer, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Histidine, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO SCALP REVIVAL MICRO-EXFOLIATING SHAMPOO - This one feels pretty good, but sometimes it leaves my hair feeling too \"squeaky clean\" and I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating my scalp every wash day. \n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Glyceryl Stearate*, Glycerin*, Microcrystalline Cellulose*, Cocamidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Hydrogenated Castor Oil*, Lithium Magnesium Sodium Silicate, Panthenol, Xylitylglucoside*, Charcoal Powder*, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Oil*, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil*, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil*, Anhydroxylitol*, Bisabolol, Menthyl Lactate*, Xylitol*, Polyquaternium-7, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-di-t-butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Fragrance (Parfum), Citric Acid*, Sodium Hydroxide\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO BLOSSOM & BLOOM VOLUMIZING SHAMPOO (which I guess was recently discontinued?) - Feels pretty good as well, some itchiness.\n\nIngredients: Water, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Glycerin*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate*, Polysorbate 80*, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate*, Soyamidopropyldimethylamine Oxide*, Maltodextrin*, Biotin, Panthenol, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate*, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Citrus Tangerina (Tangerine) Peel Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Mentha Viridis (Spearmint) Leaf Oil, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Sodium C14-18 Olefin Sulfonate*, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate*, Polyquaternium-7, Polyquaternium-71, Fragrance, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid\n\n-\n\nBRIOGEO CURL CHARISMA SHAMPOO - Moderate itchiness on my scalp and also just way too heavy for my hair.\n\nIngredients: Water/Aqua/Eau, Lauramidopropyl Betaine*, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate*, Glycerin*, Glycol Distearate*, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract*, Rice Amino Acids*, Lactobacillus/Tomato Fruit Ferment Extract*, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil*, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil*, Acanthus Mollis Leaf Extract*, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Keratin Amino Acids*, Coconut Acid*, Hydrolyzed Quinoa*, Sodium Hyaluronate*, Acyl Coenzyme A Desaturase*, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil*, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil*, Polyquaternium-71, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate*, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Isethionate, Polyquaternium-7, Anhydroxylitol*, Xylitylglucoside*, Xylitol*, Fragrance (Parfum), Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in! It could just be complete coincidence though obviously! I’ve also found I get slightly itchy with boots extra firm mousse which has polyquaternium 16. \n\nI’ve also found that my hair feels instantly dry (as in not wet, not as in straw like) to the touch soon as the water isn’t on it when I’m washing it as if there is a film on it and that doesn’t happen with the body shop shampoo either. \n\nI could be completely off the mark here but I’ve never seen anyone else have the same issue!",

Do different types of protein behave differently? \n\nI have 2cish, med-fine, past armpit length and it’s low porosity at the top and higher porosity on the bottom half where I have had bleach.\n\nMy next wash day I’m going to using bouncecurl cream (which I love!), boucleme gel THEN I’m going to spray with bouncecurl hairspray which is very holdy.

If some kind soul who is knowledgeable about this could just look through the list and mark \"OK\" or \"NOT OK\" on all the products, I would be so grateful so that I can sell or give away these products as they are new. \n\nTheese are the products i use:\n\n  \n**FACE MASKS**\n\n**Evolve organic beauty, bio retinol gold mask**\n\n**INCI:** Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Glycerin [\\[2\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-2)KaolinPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)MicaCi 77891 (Titanium Dioxide)SilicaCi 77491 (Iron Oxide)Sucrose LaurateRosa Canina (Rosehip) Fruit Oil [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Perfume (Fragrance) [\\[3\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-3)Bidens Pilosa ExtractAstrocaryum Murumuru Seed ButterGossypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed OilLinum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed OilCitrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Fruit Water [\\[1\\]](https://www.ecco-verde.com/evolve-organic-beauty/bio-retinol-gold-mask#cite_note-fa75add99e33c3b7b-1)Vanilla planifolia fruit oilTocopherol (Vitamin E)Sucrose StearateSucrose PalmitateTin Oxide\n\n1. from controlled organic agriculture\n2. made using natural raw ingredients\n3. from natural essential oils\n\n**Mantle, The dream mask**\n\n**INCI:** Aqua (Water), Hydrogenated Ethylhexyl Olivate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Seed Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) Leaf Extract, Bakuchiol, Hydrogenated Olive Oil Unsaponifiables, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hippophae Rhamnoides Fruit Extract, Ubiquinone, Phospholipids, Sphingolipids, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Tocopherol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Beta-Sitosterol, Squalene, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Litsea Cubeba Fruit Oil (Parfum/Fragrance), Citral, Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol\n\n\n\n**La prairie, 3 min peel mask**\n\n**INCI:** water (aqua), lactic acid, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, glycolic acid, tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine, polyglyceryl-3 laurate, peg-8/smdi copolymer, hexylene glycol, sodium hydroxide polyglyceryl-6 caprylate, polyglyceryl-4 caprate, salicylic acid, malic acid, hydroxyethylcellulose, glycoproteins\\*, panax ginseng root extract\\*, equisetum arvense extract\\*, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract\\*, lactobacillus ferment\\*, sucrose, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, glucose, fructose, glycerin, urea, tocopheryl acetate, sodium nitrate, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, dextrin, polysorbate 60, octyldodecanol, sorbitan isostearate, sodium stearoyl glutamate, tetrasodium glutamate diacetate, echium plantagineum seed oil, alanine, polyquaternium-7, tocopherol, ethylhexylglycerin, fragrance (parfum), alpha-isomethyl ionone, linalool, phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, titanium dioxide (ci 77891)     i75\n\n\n\n**La prairie, Luxe sleep mask**\n\n**INCI:** Water (Aqua), Propanediol, Dimethicone, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Oil, Squalane, Glycerin, Sorbitan Stearate, Jojoba Esters, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Alcohol, Nylon-12, Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Carrageenan, Caviar Extract, Caulerpa Lentillifera Extract, Lactobacillus Ferment, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Tocopherol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide NP, Sodium DNA, RNA, Hydrolyzed Rice Bran Protein, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Tetrapeptide-3, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pullulan, Panthenol, Coco-Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Pantolactone, Sucrose Stearate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Phytate, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Yeast Extract, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Carbomer, Polysorbate 60, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Red 4 (CI 14700), Blue 1 (CI 42090) i74 \\* New patent pending for la prairie’s exclusive Cellular Complex in addition to US Patent 5,840,309 \\*\\* The declaration on the packaging prevails.

For some it's mild, but for me it feels like the flu.  \n\n\nSo a particular company sells 2 products, both of which I bought, one which helps get rid of caffeine WD supposedly, and the other which supposedly you can take at night and will quickly metabolize and eliminate the caffeine you had during the day so you can sleep better without the caffeine effecting you, and it sounds like that one maybe almost instantly put you into caffeine WD.  \n\n\nSo, I take Klonopin and Lexepro, and I also often take prescribed Dexadrine which in some cases has helped me use less coffee (I know it's weird...I'd like to quit Dexadrine also to be honest...) and I'm wondering if anyone knows if either of these products might interact negatively with them or just not be safe.  \n\n\nI'm guessing no one will know and i'll have to decide if I want to take the risk myself, but I figured I'd ask.  \n\n\nSo the 1st one I'm thinking I will try first is just to help get through caffeine WD and it contains the following:   \n\n\nDandelion root extract (taxicum officicinale)   \nAshwaganda root extract. (Withania somnifera)   \nGinseng root extract(Panay chines is)   \nSchisandra fruit extract (schisandra chinensis)   \nInert geiatine,sodium copper,chlorophylin titanium dioxide),rice flower,magnesium sterate,silica  \n\n\nDoes anyone know about the general safety of these herbs?  \n\n\nAnd also, would any of them negatively interact with Dexadrine, Klonopin or Lexapro?  \n\n\nI have heard Ashwaganda is safe, would assume Dandelion is safe, I have used Ginseng, but I know nothing about the others and I especially want to be sure they don't have MAOIs or super powerful serotonin releasing agents as those could interact negatively with either my dex or lexapro.  \n\n\nI may end up combining it with Dexadrine because I have used Dex to break my caffeine habit temporarily WITHOUT going back to the Dexadrine either, because without SOME kind of stimulation I get too tired and miserable from the caffeine WD, but if combining the 2 is dangerous I won't do it.  \n\n\nThe other one is weird and I am skeptical.   \n\n\nIt contains a fruit called Rutaecarpine which supposedly does the following:  \n\n\n* RUTAECARPINE, is a natural fruit that has extraordinary properties known to reduce the effects of caffeine. It's a natural acting sleep aid to help you unwind and relax after enjoying a day with coffee/caffeine\n* It is possibly, the most potent traditional sleep remedy for coffee drinkers with caffeine cancelling Rutaecarpine\n* Rutaecarpine, quickly relaxes your mind to help you wake up refreshed without any nasty side effects\n* If you are a coffee drinker and have experienced difficulty sleeping it may be due to the effects of coffee.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know, if anything it's possible that these things might not work at all, but if they aren't dangerous, especially not to mix with my meds, then I figure it's worth a shot.  \n\n\nThe only reason I think I'd be more cautious first about the 2nd one and see if the 1st one works 1st is cause I drink A LOT of coffee and some of the people responding on the site said it puts you into IMMEDIATE caffeine WD and since caffeine can raise blood pressure it made me wonder if my blood pressure might drop too quickly in an unsafe way if I took it after a day of drinking coffee.  \n\n\nAnyone know anything about any of these supplements?  \n\n\nThanks.",

From my limited understanding (and please correct me if I’m wrong) I’ve read that the oxidation of Vitamin C is in fact bad or no longer useful for you and from what I can tell this ‘activation’ is the Vitamin C oxidizing? When it comes out of the pump, it’s a light pink/peach gel and when it is spread on my face it turns a white color/cream consistency. After 15 min or so it turns somewhat clear/slightly white or skin toned (I’m Indian so my skin is dark so it could be turning a brown shade not sure). \n\nWhat I’m trying to understand is if this product is causing more harm than good?

        "body": "I personally follow a philosophy of formula minimalism. \"Less is more.\" That means you only include ingredients that have some detectable benefit. You have a lot of ingredients in the formula that if you didn't put them in there you would notice no difference. \n\nFor example, Glycerin is a humectant. So that seaweed extract is going to do nothing detectable because it is also mainly just a humectant. You could just increase the level of glycerin & skip using the seaweed.  Similarly, you have rice bran oil and oat oil in your formula. They have essentially the same fatty acid distribution. One of them you don't need. Silk amino acid is not doing anything different than hydrolyzed rice protein. \n\nIn truth, you could probably get rid of all the extracts or put them down to 0.01% levels and not notice a performance difference. This would also reduce the chance that someone who uses the product will have an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in your formula. Each one of those natural materials is made up of dozens or more chemicals, any one of which could cause a reaction in someone.\n\nHowever, as someone else said, if you like how the product works then leave how it is.",

    "body": "Papa Recipe Bombee Sheet Masks\n\nMask Materials for this Set vary from Mask to Mask. The Whitening and Regular Honey Mask both featured a typical Cotton Type Mask…but they were incredibly easy to stretch and fit over my Face. I’ve heard this type of Cotton-Blend Material called “Tencel Sheet” or “Cupra”…but I don’t know of the formal name that Papa Recipe gives theirs. The Black Honey Mask Pack has the same Material…but it was black in color. The Rose Gold Honey Mask Pack also has a similar Mask Material, however there is a fun/interesting Gold Honeycomb Pattern on the Mask. Finally, the Ginseng Red Honey Oil Mask Pack uses a Paper Mask Material.\n\nI’m going to touch on each Mask individually and then go over how I felt about the Set a whole as well as select some favorites. As far as Ingredients, I’ll do my best to list as many as I can…with an emphasis on what sets each Essence Formula apart. Keep in mind that the Scent for all of these Masks was Honey/Vanilla across the board (to my). Some were more fragrant than others…and the Scent did tend to linger. But, I really enjoyed it and didn’t find the potency to be an issue. Also, all of these Papa Recipe Honey Masks had the same thin yet Serum-Like Consistency…other than the Reg Ginseng Mask (see below). \n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Whitening Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This Whitening Mask contained Ingredients such as Honey Extract, Propolis Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, and Green Tea Leaf Extract as well as some new/interesting Hanbang Ingredients for me including Sweet Flag Root and Beefsteak Extracts. But, these Ingredients were in most of the other Masks. What set this one apart from the others was the addition of Niacinamide and Sodium Hyaluronate for extra brightening power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As you’ll see in my experience with most of these Papa Recipe Masks…there wasn’t a ton of Essence to go around. I was only able to keep this Whitening Mask on for 10 minuets before it began to dry. After removal my Skin did feel slightly hydrated…but the effect wasn’t that impressive. Also, I didn’t seem to notice any significant brightening. Once the Excess Essence was fully absorbed, it left behind a slightly tacky residue…probably due to the Honey and Propolis in the Formula. \n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Honey Mask:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* For this Mask…Papa Recipe kept it relatively simple compared to the others in this Set. Other than the Ingredients found in all of the other Masks…this one didn’t have a “Special/Featured” Ingredient. Once again I was only able to keep it on for about 10 minutes. I did find this Honey Mask to give me the classic “K-Beauty Glow”…but the result was short lived and the tacky/sticky feeling was apparent here as well.\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Black Honey Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The Black Honey Mask was the third that I used in the Set and it included Ceramide in the Ingredients List. In addition, the Black Mask Material also gave the Essence a slight Grey Tint that I found interesting. This Mask was a bit more saturated with Essence and I was actually able to keep in on for 20 minutes…and probably could have gone longer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After removal I was happy to see that my Skin looked and felt very hydrated and plump. Also, some of the redness I was experiencing from Exfoliation had diminished. But, as with most of these Bombee Masks…the tacky/sticky feeling was there. For this Mask, it was even more intense and took about 10 minutes after application to fully absorb.\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Rose Gold Honey Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In addition to the unique “Honeycomb Foil Pattern” of this Rose Gold Mask’s Material…Rose Flower and Pearl Extract were the Featured Ingredients. Of all the Honey Masks in this Set, this one was SOAKED in Essence lol! I kept this one on for 25 minutes before removal. Afterwards my Skin was super hydrated and also brighter in a way that not even the Whitening Mask was able to provide. Also, I found this Essence Formula to be a bit thinner and my Skin easily absorbed the excess. Not as much of that sticky feeling with this one!\n\nPapa Recipe Bombee Ginseng Red Honey Oil Mask Pack:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The most intriguing (to me) of this Set…this Ginseng Mask used a totally different Mask Material and Essence Formula than the rest. I typically am not a fan of Paper Masks…as they tend to be more rigid and difficult to keep on. But, this Mask managed to stay in place pretty well considering the Paper Material. Also, the Essence Formula was Oil Based..and felt a bit more luxurious on the Skin. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* As for the Oil/Essence Formula…it contained some of the Highlighted Ingredients from the other Masks (Rose and Sodium Hyaluronate). But, it featured Ginseng Root Extract…which is one of my all-time favorite Skincare Ingredients! I loved the Herbal Scent of the Ginseng combined with the Honey…pretty amazing in my Eyes lol! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I was able to keep this Mask on for 20 minutes and after removal my Skin was hydrated…but in more of a nourishing was as compared to the Water Based Formulas found in the other Bombee Masks. My Oily/Combination Skin does not always do well with Oil Based/Occlusive Formulas…but I was happy to find that this Essence absorbed super quickly into my Skin without leaving a heavy/Oily Layer. \n\nWell there you have it lol! Overall it has been a pretty great week of Sheet Masking. Although I found all of these Papa Recipe Bombee Honey Masks to perform pretty well…the Rose Gold and Ginseng Masks were the standouts to me. The Whitening, Original Honey, and Black Masks just didn’t have the long lasting effect that I was hoping for…and some even felt a little dry right out of the Package. Also, I wasn’t a big fan of the tacky/sticky residue left behind by them. The Rose Gold seemed to do a better job of getting all those wonderful Ingredients deep into my Skin. And, the Ginseng Oil Mask was a surprisingly different consistency that actually played really well with my Skin Type. \n\nI was lucky enough to find these Papa Recipe Bombee Honey Masks at a local Asian Gift/Beauty Store for $3.99 USD each…but they seem to bit more affordable from Online Shops. Personally, I would only consider repurchasing the Rose Gold and Ginseng Versions. But, I think the Scents, general Hydrating Effects, and fun Packaging are quite appealing. The Ginseng Oil Mask was the standout overall and I think it would be perfect for most Skin Types…especially with the drying/cold Winter Weather! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khuzrh30y3n41.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=080f085f1bee2f5f6656e2d9ee8c9812bd021e89",

Additionally, conducting thorough research, reading reviews, and consulting with a hair care professional can help you find the best natural hair dye for your individual needs.\n\n* Which is the No 1 hair colour in world?\n\nsome of the most popular and widely recognized hair color brands globally include L'Oréal Paris, Clairol, Wella, Schwarzkopf, Garnier, and Revlon. These brands offer a wide range of hair color products, including permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary options, catering to various hair colors, shades, and preferences.\n\nTo determine the current top-selling hair color product, it would be best to consult industry reports, market research data, or look for information on reputable beauty and haircare websites or publications.\n\n* Which is the No 1 hair dye in India?\n\nHair dye preferences and sales can vary over time and can be influenced by various factors such as marketing strategies, brand reputation, and consumer preferences.\n\nHowever, some of the popular and well-known hair dye brands in India include:\n\n1.

In this system, each number represents a different level of darkness or lightness, with 1 being the darkest (black) and 10 being the lightest (palest blonde).\n\nThe number before the decimal point indicates the level of darkness, while the number after the decimal point represents the tone or undertone. In the case of 7.0, the number 7 signifies a medium blonde shade. The \"0\" after the decimal point typically indicates a neutral tone.\n\nIt's important to note that hair dye brands may have variations in their numbering system or specific shade names. Therefore, it's always recommended to consult the brand's color chart or descriptions to ensure you understand the specific shade you're considering.\n\n* What is 6G hair dye?\n\nIn the context of hair dye, 6G refers to a specific shade within a numerical hair color system. The numerical system is used to classify different levels of darkness or lightness and various tones of hair color.\n\nIn this system, the number before the decimal point represents the level of darkness or lightness, while the letter or number after the decimal point indicates the tone or undertone. The \"G\" in 6G stands for \"golden.\" Therefore, 6G hair dye is a shade that is classified as a medium golden blonde.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specific shade and undertone can vary between different hair dye brands. It's always advisable to check the brand's color chart or descriptions to ensure you have a clear understanding of the shade you are considering.\n\n* What is level 9 hair?\n\nLevel 9 hair refers to the lightness or darkness of the hair on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the darkest (black) and 10 being the lightest (palest blonde). In the hair color scale, level 9 is considered a very light blonde shade.\n\nHair at level 9 is typically several shades lighter than a medium blonde (level 7) and just a few shades away from being classified as a lightest blonde (level 10). It falls within the range of blonde shades, and its lightness can vary depending on individual hair characteristics and the hair dye used.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that achieving and maintaining a specific hair color requires consideration of factors such as natural hair color, hair type, and the specific hair dye product being used. Consulting with a professional hairstylist can help determine the best approach to achieve and maintain a desired level 9 hair color.",

What I like about it is that it's fairly smooth, no jitters, and has b-vitamins and other stuff.  I'm wondering if anyone knows of the equivalent in pill form because those little plastic vials of goodness are like a dollar a dose.  \n\n\nHere's the ingredients off of amazon:  \n\n\n Ingredients: Citric acid, glucose polymers, potassium carbonate, tartaric acid, calcium ascorbate, natural flavors, magnesium glycinate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, caffeine (guarana seed extract), silica, grape skin extract, L-arginine, potassium citrate, taurine, sucralose, d-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, niacin, zinc amino acid chelate, grape seed extract, manganese gluconate, green tea leaf extract, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, chromium dinicotinate glycinate, alpha-lipoic acid, D-calcium pantothenate, cyancobalamin, KonaRed™ coffee fruit, American ginseng root extract, ginger root, selenium-L-methionine complex, xylitol, riboflavin-5-phosphate, thiamin hydrochloride, folic acid and methylcobalamin.",
