    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nThis is gonna be a really long one, so I’ll try to keep introductions brief. I love trying new things for the purpose of data, and sometimes I actually sit down and share it lol. I am going to go through what I look for in a moisturizer, my routine, and my skin type before getting to the reviews. The longer ones come first because when I wrote out this list, I decided to do it by brand, so the brands I had the most experience with ended up coming first.\n\nFor a moisturizer, it’s often difficult to nail down what works best. I have normal skin that leans combo or dry depending on the weather, so when I use a moisturizer I want something that will be significant, but not too emollient. For a daily moisturizer, I prefer something that dries down quickly, so that the time between that and my sunscreen can be minimized. There needs to be a certain thickness to it, though. If it applies like a serum, it’s a no for me. In addition, while I love when it dries down quickly, a lot of creams designed with this in mind end up taking away more than they add in terms of moisture. Ingredients like dimethicone, silicone, and hydrogenated lecithin leave me oily yet dry - I can tolerate them depending on the cream, but if it is a drawback I’ll mention it.\n\nMy routine is as follows:\n\nAM:\n\n1. Light cleanse (nothing, water, toning pads, or Sanskrit Saponins by NIOD)\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily moisturizer\n5. Sunscreen\n\nPM:\n\n1. Double cleanse\n2. Toner\n3. Serum\n4. Daily Moisturizer\n5. Treatment\n6. Occlusive\n\nI try to stay fragrance free, use as much Niacinamide as I can, and cover Ceramides, Peptides, Beta Glucan, and Panthenol through the routine I choose. I will be using a 5 point system based on my preferences, so stuff like fragrance being a negative for me is obviously not a negative for everyone.\n\nIsntree’s Onion Newpair Gel Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a great option and one of their best moisturizers - I am shallow so I won’t lie about being obsessed with the slight purple hue. I’ve seen it retail from $10 USD all the way up to $40, and I have no idea why haha. It is not a holy grail hyperpigmentation treatment, but it is fantastic at evening out skin tone and giving you a nice healthy glow. It has 71% Onion Extract as well as Niacinamide, which are the two main ingredients I would purchase this for. While it has tranexamic acid, a vitamin c derivative, and a bunch of other great ingredients; they are probably all well below .1%. This does dry down pretty quickly, so it makes a fantastic daily moisturizer under sunscreen. What I love about this gel cream is that your face could be violently wet, but this would still apply like a normal moisturizer. It absorbs moisture and locks in whatever you’ve done before better than most, which is a compliment I’d pay to a lot of their gel creams. I wish this one didn’t have dimethicone, though.\n\nIsntree’s C-Niacin Toning Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a very similar cream to the Onion Newpair, but instead of a light purple, it’s a vibrant orange. Trade onions for sea buckthorn, and you’d get this product. This is better to me, though, because of the fact it is their cheapest moisturizer almost at all times, the lovely yet natural smell, and it is the best glow booster I have ever used. It dries down so well, but it will leave you with a glowy, hydrated complexion while staying dry to the touch. It is glass skin in a tube, essentially. The blend of oils, addition of beta glucan, and removal of dimethicone just overall makes this their best cream.\n\nIsntree’s Cica Relief Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is a strange addition to their catalog and it seems like they’ve phased out the entire line, perhaps to relaunch it as they do. It is one of those creams that further emulsifies on contact with water, so it becomes impossible to use if you use the wet skin method. It is legitimately impossible to blend in without white streaks. The ingredient list is impressive with basically everything you could ask for (especially the peptides whew), but its lack of utility would never make me feel comfortable recommending it. It is also piss-poor at locking in moisture because of this, which is again pretty point defeating.\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Moist Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is a serum, essentially. I can’t imagine what the Aqua is like, because the Moist version doesn’t lock anything in on a wet face at all. As always, the ingredient list is fire, but this doesn’t succeed as a moisturizer for me. It’s a pretty cost-effective serum, though!\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\n5/5\n\nThis is an all-time great. They struck gold with this formulation, and I hope they never stop making it. I have bought at least 15 of these, and considering how much I like to try new things, something becoming a staple means something haha. I would describe this as a goopy occlusive containing almost no occlusives that somehow just works. If you use it as your final step, your skin will be well protected and wake up so hydrated. If you want to use it as a serum, it absolutely smashes all other hydrating serums and you only need a little. I will alternate between both using it as a serum and an occlusive depending on the weather. One drawback is that it is so THICK that you do need to melt it down in your hands sometimes depending on how much you’re using. \n\nIsntree’s Chestnut PHA Clear Cream\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother fantastic product that is actually super new. They used to have a PHA sleeping mask that caught them in hot water because it had some fragrant extract (lol), but this updated version adds chestnut extract and removes any fragrance. According to their insta, they wanted this to be more of a daily moisturizer akin to the onion and c-niacin creams, and I’d say they mostly succeeded in doing this. The ingredient list is another humble brag, and I’d say overall this has helped me so much with daily usage. The benefits of getting minor exfoliation every single day kind of speak for themselves. I will say that this doesn’t dry down as well as their other daily moisturizers, but I would just use less of it if this bothers you. I also find it doesn’t “lock in” as well as some moisturizers do, but having a PHA 5% gel cream is just too useful for me to not love it.\n\nIsntree’s Mugwort Spot Gel Cream\n\n4/5\n\nI’m gonna be honest, I find it suspicious that this doesn’t smell like mugwort even a little bit. I could add a drop of One Thing’s Mugwort toner and make this thing so fragrant, so I am just a bit confused there haha. This is very, very similar to the onion and c-niacin creams in the way that it locks in everything really well and dries down quickly. It doesn’t have Niacinamide, which is a bit of a drawback overall to me, but if you are one of the B3 haters out there, then this would be the one for you. It does a great job at reducing redness and was a great medicinal treatment of a burn I got recently. I’d recommend this cream up and down, but it is typically just a bit too expensive for what it is.\n\nIsntree’s Yam Root Cream\n\n5/5\n\nThis is a unique product in their line as it is their only moisturizer outside of the HA sleeping mask that aims to be heavy. It has 57% yam root extract with a bunch of other great, soothing/brightening extracts like rice, soybean, and oat. It also has 5 ceramides and cholesterol, which isn’t a common feature for them. This does dry down pretty well, but not nearly as well as the others, seemingly by design. It applies like a luxury cream and was so similar to Then I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream that I just put the rest of the cream in that packaging and mixed it with hemi-squalane to provide even more moisture. This is their best moisturizer for people with dry skin IMO\n\niUNIK’s Propolis Vitamin Sleeping Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love the concept of this cream - both propolis and sea buckthorn joined together. It’s like a trip through the superfoods section of your local supplement shop. This does have niacinamide, but at a probably lower concentration than the other ones above (though who really knows? lol). This one is significant to me because it very firmly locks in everything before it and dries down pretty quickly to a dewy finish. I don’t think it’s the best sleeping mask in the world, but it’s a great daily moisturizer. \n\niUNIK’s Beta Glucan Daily Moisture Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nY’all already know I love beta glucan, but this cream is the exact same consistency as the HA Moist Cream from Isntree. It is more of a serum for me than a moisturizer. I still loved it in this capacity, but I find their beta glucan serum to be a much better option and just a bit more expensive.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Calming Gel Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis isn’t even a cream at all, which makes me laugh a little bit. It would make a really watery serum, too. It is a bit fragrant and is essentially an overpriced cica gel. I’d just get Isntree’s Aloe options if you’re looking into this one. I don’t really understand how this is sold as a facial cream.\n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Concentrate Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is of course an HG, but it is a bit drying for winter temps because of the dimethicone/hydrogenated lecithin. Since this dries down while just sitting on your face, it makes your face somehow dry to the touch AND super waxy. The benefits speak for themselves, and it has helped me through some difficult skin eras, but my time of using it has passed. I also think the ceramide beads are a neat trick that does help deliver those ingredients freshly to your skin, they make the product into a bit of a scrub. My skin is sensitive to rubbing/friction over really anything else, so applying this to compromised skin always made me worried even though it helped in the end haha. \n\nIlliyoon’s Ceramide ATO Soothing Gel Cream\n\n4.75/5\n\nImagine if you took what I liked about the Isntree daily moisturizers and reduced it down to the most basic possible ingredient list. This gets docked for only having .05% ceramides, but I don’t really care to be honest. In the world where I stop feeling like trying something new every day, this is what I would choose as my everyday moisturizer and my nightly gel cream as I prefer basic formulations. This is never my final step, but if it is, it will leave your skin looking a bit wet/glassy for a while. It’s somehow dry to the touch during this stage, but a lot of people wouldn’t really love that.\n\nCOSRx’s Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream\n\n4/5\n\nIf this came in a tube, I would be giving it a perfect rating, and would actually purchase and use it regularly. The smell is *heavenly*, the consistency is so delightfully goopy, and it goes on like a luxury gel cream. COSRx is legit WILD for making a bunch of creams and somehow ONLY putting their goopy creams in tubs - it’s genuinely illogical. It’s why I’ve never purchased the snail cream - like why would I? lol This also leaves a pretty oily film on your skin after, but I don’t even care. I just love the texture - if I’m ever rich I am going to buy this in bulk and bathe in it.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium D-panthenol Cream\n\n4/5\n\nThis has silicone and dimethicone, so it does dry down super quickly. It is the only cream of theirs that I’d feel comfortable using as my final step, though, and I find it to be more than enough at night. The drying down aspect makes it a fantastic daily moisturizer, as well. Purito’s 10% is a bit better, but this one would function better as a daily moisturizer. I do like this as it helps firm and even out redness, but I wouldn’t repurchase it unless it was on a good sale.\n\nCOSRx’s Rice Spa Overnight Mask\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis isn’t a sleeping mask, and yes I am docking it for this. This is the same consistency as the Isntree HA Moist Cream/iUNIK Beta Glucan Cream and this one is just egregious because it’s a sleeping mask. It is somehow, at the same time, quite oily looking after. I would compare it to Illiyoon’s ATO Lotion (not reviewed here) in the way that it’s not nearly enough to be a moisturizer while somehow never sinking in and clogging pores lol. I know a lot of people love this one, but it wasn’t for me. I ended up using it on my body.\n\nCOSRx’s Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream\n\n1.5/5\n\nI really didn’t like this one - it was this gross waxy texture because they went for a “matte balm” texture. This is achieved by making a SUPER emollient cream and adding dimethicone, trimethicone, and hydrogenated lecithin. I am assuming they are trying to duplicate the Ceramidin smell with the bergamot, but this is somehow way more fragrant than anything I’ve used from Dr. Jart (SOMEHOW). It is to me a bit of a formulational failure, so I wouldn’t recommend it; but I am sure this is many people’s holy grail. YMMV\n\nCOSRx’s Propolis Overnight Mask\n\n4.5/5\n\nAnother serum! This one does work as a sleeping mask, but it is a very liquidy texture for such an impressive gel cream. This is one of my favorite CosRx products because it’s basically just propolis goop. If you want to use it as a sleeping mask, your face has to be completely dried down or else it will apply like a serum. I ended up not using it very often, so I added it to my One Thing Mugwort Toner and made a super viscous and frothy toner. I call it Iced Tea.\n\nCOSRx’s Cica Pure Fit Cream\n\n2/5\n\nI experienced no lift on my redness with this, and it dries down to the point where it takes away more than it adds. It has a beautifully thick and creamy texture that goes nowhere once applied. I ended up using this on my body because of the dryness it caused on my face, but this would be a decent daily cream for people as long as it goes under a sunscreen. I used this as a sleeping mask once and my skin was so dry the next day - wouldn’t recommend it at all for that.\n\nRound Lab’s Pine Cream\n\n3.75/5\n\nAyyyyyyyy another serum I actually like. This doesn’t do anything as far as locking in moisture goes, but it’s an awesome antioxidant-based hydrating serum. It has LHA, which is meant to help with evening out your skin tone. I found this was an excellent hydration and glow booster, but it really did help even out my tone. I am a big fan of this one, but considering it isn’t a great moisturizer, I’ll just spring for the serum next time.\n\n9Wishes Pine Cream\n\n1/5\n\nThis, just like Round Lab’s cream, was more of a serum than anything else. It lightly burned on contact (like CeraVe or Paula’s Choice moisturizers) and has terrible pump packaging that makes it super difficult to get the product out. I love the sunscreen and the toner from this line (both perfect 5/5’s), so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Gel Cream\n\n5/5\n\nI am surprised I haven’t repurchased this as I was a massive fan. It was scentless to me, which is an experience I haven’t had with any other A'pieu product. It does dry down really well while sealing in everything very well - this is a cream that perfectly strikes the balance for me. It is not so drying that it takes away moisture like some of the creams above, but it’s a great priming moisturizer before sunscreen or makeup. \n\nApieu’s Madecassoside Moisture Gel Cream\n\n3.5/5\n\nIn terms of texture, this is a cream that is directly comparable to Isntree’s Onion Newpair cream for me. Hydrating, moisturizing, and dries down quickly - it’s just blue instead of purple. It does have dimethicone, but I only hold certain ingredients against the product if it seems to do the thing I hate LOL - this isn’t drying and it doesn’t just sit there. It is also quite fragrant, which I wasn’t a fan of. \n\nThen I Met You’s Renewing Rich Beauty Cream:\n\n5/5\n\nThis is the best cream I have ever used, and it makes me so sad because it’s $54. I compared the Yam Root Moisturizer to this, but in reality this has a much more luxurious texture. Imagine if you took an expensive Asian ginseng-based anti-aging cream, removed all the bad ingredients, and put it in beautiful periwinkle packaging. You’d have this. It doesn’t dry down quickly at all, but it’s not heavy - just very emollient. It is an amazing night cream, and I would love it so much more if it came in a tube.",

That's just me tho :) The Cosrx is definitely weaker, but suitable for those with very sensitive skin who needs very slow exfoliation.   \n\n\n**QUESTION TIME!** \n\nDoes anyone know anything about JainaFace? How legit is this brand?   \nI have their 10% Glycolic Acid that doesn't even tingle on my face and seems to do nothing at all. Meanwhile, Cosrx AHA liquid, that has a lower percentage of free acid even, tingles. I suspect this brand to be a hoax but I'm not sure. Their 2% salicylic acid doesnt' really do anything for me either *(and I have spent 12 months testing out salicylic acids)*.  Same with a friend, she says she tried some products *(HA and some vitamin C stuff)* but that it didn't do anything for her face at all.   \nI contacted JainaFace a couple of months back to ask **1**. why they are allowed to use 2% salicylic acid in their products when the limit is 0.5% in Korea, and **2**. why there is next to zero information about this brand.  \nThe person who answered was nice enough but I find it shady that they don't want to market themselves... They claimed they would have to think about it, if it was true that people were starting to think they repackage and sell an American product, or that their products are generally fake/Chinese.  \nNothing's really happened except I saw they made a reddit account and posted a statement in  a reddit thread that they're not fake :P",

I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long 😂\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ☺️ If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ❤️\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ✨️the search bar✨️ as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ☺️\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#✨️ First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#✨️ Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\". Pharma product with incomplete ingredients - currently using, will review)\n\n+ Pulp Off-Duty Cleanser - Aloe Vera, Azelaic Acid, and Alpha Arbutin\n\n+ Aqualogica Clear+ Smoothie Face wash\n\n+ Aqualogica Radiance+ Smoothie Face wash (contains menthol)\n\n+ Plum Green Tea Pore-Cleansing Face Wash (contains cellulose beads and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Put Simply Get Your Greens pH Balanced Gel Cleanser \n\n+ Joy Coconut & Coffee Skin Refreshing & Energising Anti Pollution Gel Scrub (contains walnut shell, coffee seed powder, and perfume - wouldn't suggest for sensitive skin)\n\n+ Joy Spearmint & Eucalyptus Mood Uplifting & Skin Softening Stress Relief Scrub (Seems to be a sugar scrub, contains spearmint & eucalyptus essentil oils)\n\n+ VLCC Mulberry and Rose Fairness Face Wash (contains mulberry, rose, orange and lemon peel extract and glycolic acid)\n\n+ Round Lab 1025 Dokdo Cleanser\n\n#🐳 Moisturizers\n\n**Note:** people with malassezia have quite an individual reaction to squalane. Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me. Soothing and healing for skin, plus I use it every time I shampoo - I use the WOW one only if this is unavailable)\n\n+ Rahul Phate's lnnovations Hydra-smooth Hydrating Gel (contains urea.

It's more expensive that the Rahul Phate one, but on the pro side - it's vegan [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/sirkr3/review_of_fungalsafe_moisturiser_dr_sheths_aloe_1/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Haldi & Hyaluronic Acid Oil-Free Moisturizer (contains \"haldi beads\")\n\n+ Dr. Sheth’s Hibiscus and Niacinamide Lotion (contains 5% niacinamide and allantoin, mentions lightweight but also contains occlusives like paraffin above the 5% niacinamide, so if ingredient order is reliable, this may be good for those with dryness)\n\n+ Dr. Sheth's Vitamin E & Ginseng Moisturizing Cream (contains light liquid paraffin as occlusive, so should help for drier skin)\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sea Glow Gel\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Phyto Clear Oil-free Moisturiser (contains Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract) \n\n+ Earth Rhythm Depuff Undereye Gel (contains kojic acid,   botanical extracts)\n\n+ ONE THING Centella Soothing Cream ([my review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/z72rrf/review_one_thing_centella_soothing_cream/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)]\n\n+ Zitmoist Gel (the [ingredients provided on the packaging](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/zitmoist-gel-50gm) are just 1% sodium hyaluronate and 0.3% allantoin, in an \"gel base containing aloe vera gel\" - incomplete list) \n\n+ e.l.f.

Yes. Do I appreciate that they clearly state when their products are malassezia safe? Also, yes 😂)\n\n+ It's Skin Aloe Relaxing Cream\n\n+ It's Skin Hyaluronic Acid Moisture Emulsion\n\n+ Aqualogica Glow+ Luminous Under Eye Gel (contains niacinamide, fragranced)\n\n+ CeraVe Healing Ointment (contains petrolatum, mineral oil, ceramides, hyaluronic acid and panthenol. Does also contain water, so I'd consider it a rich moisturizer rather than a balm/plain occlusive)\n\n+ Aveeno Daily Moisturizing  Body Lotion with SPF 15 (not the other variants, only the SPF 15 one)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Ceramide Barrier Repair Deep Nourish Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (contains ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II, cholesterol and oat extract)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX 5% Niacinamide Day Moisturiser with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (also contains alpha arbutin, ceramides 1, 2, 3, 4, 6II and cholesterol)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Oil Free Vitamin C - Illuminate + Day Moisturizer with SPF 15 for Oily Skin (contains ethyl ascorbic acid)\n\n+ Nykaa SKINRX Hyaluronic Acid Hydra-X Night Moisturizer For Oily Skin (NOT the one of the same name for Dry Skin, that one contains olive oil)\n\n+ Truekind Daily Dew Hyaluronic & Squalane Water Crème \n\n+ Truekind Manjistha and Saffron Moisture Gel (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide)\n\n+ Truekind Bio Exfoliant Brightening Sleeping Mask (contains botanicals, 1-2% niacinamide, less than 0.5% potassium azeloyl diglycinate)\n\n+ Truekind Acne Calming Herb Rescue Mask (gel mask with various botanical extracts - suggested use as sleeping mask/daytime moisturizer)\n\n+ Lakmé Sun Expert After Sun Cooling Gel\n\n+ Joy Hydra Refresh Ultra Light Gel (with glycerin, allantoin and D-panthenol.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ☺️\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n⚠️ Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out 🙃)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench – 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details. From what I can find online, its derived from [sugarcane and beets](https://m.facebook.com/theordinary/photos/a.286843978083265/2326766210757688/?type=3)]\n\n+ Earth Rhythm Sugar squalane (ingredient list as 100% sugarcane derived)\n\n#🌤 Sunscreens \n\n+ Episoft AC moisturizer with microencapsulated sunscreen SPF 30 (water-based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Spf 30+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Fixderma Shadow Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA+++ Gel (water based)\n\n+ Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ (the blue one - silicone based) \n\n+ Brinton Healthcare UvDoux Face & Body Sunscreen gel with SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne-UV Gel SPF 30 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ IPCA Acne UV Gel SPF 50 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+/PA+++ - green (contains denatured alcohol as third ingredient, and various botanical extracts, water based)\n\n+ DermaCo 1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum SPF 50 PA++++ (has niacinamide - water based)\n\n+ DermaCo Hyaluronic Invisible Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++ with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E (silicone based)\n\n+ DermaCo Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF60 PA+++ (silicone based)\n\n+ Plum 2% Niacinamide & Rice Water SPF 50 PA+++ Hybrid Sunscreen (contains rice ferment filtrate. Water based)\n\n+ Phy Active Sun Protect Sunscreen Gel SPF 60 (no PA rating, contains niacinamide, green tea extract, panthenol, fragrance) - \"for men\" brand, same ownership as Plum\n\n+ Rivela Ultralight Matte Dry Sunscreen Gel SPF50 PA+++(silicone based)\n\n+ Bubblefarm Ultra Light Daily Sunshield SPF40 PA+++ (UVA/B)(water based) - contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract, a fermented ingredient, \"essential oil blend\"  and undisclosed \"eco-certified preservative\"\n\n+ Photon 360 Hydra Sunscreen Fluid Cream SPF50 PA+++ (water based) - near identical ingredient list to the Bubblefarm one, except it contains Yellow Iron Oxide instead of zinc oxide. Also contains Thermus Thermophilis Extract and \"essential oil blend\".

    "body": "Hi guys. This is basically satire but could I get your opinion on this morning hygiene ritual from American Psycho?\n\n> I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds. Then I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux-tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. \n\n>I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub. The shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older. \n\n>On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation. \n\n>Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. \n\n>One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin. Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural-bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\n",

    "body": "Hey y’all,\n\nI am going to review as many sunscreens as I can based on the many I have tried over the years. This is going to be a long one, but it is because I want to be specific and give as many relevant details as possible. I have normal skin I’d say with combo tendencies - I live in a climate that has super dry winters and really humid summers, so I change my routine a lot over the year. \n\nMy AM routine is as follows:\n\n1. Splash with water\n2. COSRx’s Propolis Synergy Pads\n3. Isntree’s Onion Newpair Essence Toner\n4. Cos de Baha’s 10% Azelaic Acid Serum\n5. iUNIK’s Beta Glucan Power Moisture Serum\n6. Gel Cream\n7. Sunscreen\n\nMy PM routine:\n\n1. Oil/Balm Cleanser\n2. Foaming Cleanser\n3. Peter Thomas Roth’s Unwrinkle Turbo Toning Lotion\n4. Cos de Baha’s 20% Niacinamide Serum\n5. NIOD’s Survival 0\n6. Gel Cream\n7. COSRx’s B5 D-Panthenol Cream\n8. Isntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Water Sleeping Mask\n\nI am going to rate each on a scale of 1-5, and will discuss what I liked or disliked. I tend to like sunscreens that dry down to a hydrated yet dry-to-the-touch finish, don’t become more oily or provoke dryness throughout the day, don’t leave a white cast, don’t have fragrance or alcohol, and don’t clog pores. I am going to vaguely say something has an impressive ingredient list a few times, so I will briefly list some ingredients I look for:\n\n1. Preference on hybrid sunscreens\n2. B vitamins, primarily panthenol and niacinamide\n3. Ceramides\n4. Antioxidant- or generally nutrient-heavy, non-fragrant extracts like centella asiatica, broccoli, pine, etc.\n5. Antioxidants like vitamins C and E; ferulic acid, etc.\n6. Peptides\n\nIsntree’s Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF50+ PA++++\n\n3.75/5\n\nThis is a hard one for me, because it is truly one of my go-to’s in the winter time and I have a weird affinity for it. It is surprisingly emollient to the point where I was glowing all day even in the driest of winters. This is never, ever dry to the touch; but it leaves you with such a hydrated and healthy glow that I can’t complain about it. This, at the same time, is a tricky one to recommend for dry climates because of its HA contents. For some, hyaluronic acid is a loss-heavy hydrator if not sealed in, and since this is the last step, it’s difficult to recommend it. It is a wash in humid weather, and actively causes acne for me when I try to wear it in those climates. I love it, though! It has such an amazing smell (I love sunscreen smell don’t @ me) and I just love its texture. Its ingredient list is a genuine humble brag, as well. \n\nSkin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF50 PA++++\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis, to me, is like an upgrade of the Isntree sunscreen. It is surprisingly similar to me in terms of ingredients and texture, but it dries down rather immediately. It keeps my skin very moisturized and hydrated, leaving a nice hydrated finish that doesn’t get oilier throughout the day. I worry this will dry me out in the winter, but in the currently very humid summer I have been going to this one more and more often. \n\nCanmake’s Mermaid Gel UV SPF50+ PA++++ Clear\n\n4.25/10\n\nThis is a classic for a reason, and it was my first AB sunscreen that I tried. It has no white cast, has a neat little smell, and it is surprisingly moisturizing for a sunscreen that dries down to a dewy yet try to the touch finish. This will always be a go-to, but I don’t like wearing it in the winter because it will dry out my skin and lead to some oily redness on my forehead. Perfect for the summer, as well as any day that it’s not oppressively dry. It has an amazing ingredient list, as well. My main issue is that it pills very easily - more so than any other sunscreen I’ve used. It’s just weird to me that it’s made by a makeup company and they couldn’t nail that part down haha.\n\niUNIK’s Centella Soothing Sun Cream\n\n9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n\n5/5\n\nThis is remarkably similar to Canmake’ sunscreen for me. I find that it has a very similar texture, but instead of the yellow tinted color, it’s a bit green. It ends up being a bit whiter as you rub it in, as well. This is a genuinely impressive ingredient list as far as extracts go, with pine of course being at the forefront. I love how antioxidant heavy it is, but I also think it dries down to this lovely, glassy finish. I prefer it over Canmake’s because of its more specialized ingredient list and lack of anecdotal pilling. The finish is just so silky smooth and healthy - I am a huge fan of this one. \n\nLa Roche Posay’s Anthelios UV Correct SPF 70\n\n4.75/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and if it weren’t so emollient it would be a 5/5. This is literally an SPF 70, but goes onto the face as if it were clear. I would say that apart from invisible sunscreens, this has the most immediately clear cast I’ve ever seen. It’s very thick, and smells violently of La Roche Posay sunscreen - that is to say amazing. It leaves your skin (and especially your pores) looking vehemently healthy, as if you’re actually eating your vegetables. The one problem is that it is too moisturizing for humid climates and will leave a layer on your skin even when you just apply a little. I haven’t had issues with clogged pores, but I do prefer to have my skin be dry to the touch. I am looking forward to testing this out in the winter months, and despite this being one of the most expensive sunscreens on this list, I will be repurchasing.\n\nPipette’s Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n2/5 \n\nThis is a no-go for me. It’s too moisturizing for a mineral sunscreen in my opinion, which may get a lot of people who enjoy it for that reason. This sunscreen bugs me because it advertises to people of color and brags about having no white cast when it is literally an SPF 50 Zinc-only sunscreen. Don’t lie, man. And it is a lie - while this has one of the tamest white casts I’ve seen on a sunscreen of its prior description, it is still basically white paint. It also stings when I use it, which almost never happens with sunscreens for me. It’s literally made for babies. It’s an amazing body sunscreen, but considering how much I love this brand, I have a mini beef with this product. \n\nBiossance’s Squalane + Zinc Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 PA +++\n\n2.5/5\n\nThis is fine - very similar to the above with less of a white cast and less of a chance to burn my skin. It is almost the same formulation as they have the same parent company. It is just super overpriced and virtually the same as a much cheaper product. I invest in their parent company (Amyris) because they're doing some super cool work that has the potential to be huge in the future of skincare, so believe me when I tell you I don't like their sunscreens haha.\n\nZitsticka’s MEGASHADE Breakout-proof SPF 50 Serum\n\n4.5/5\n\nThis is a top tier sunscreen, and I am surprised I have never really seen it mentioned online. It has a stunning ingredient list (truly… amazing), and it’s one of the only hybrid American sunscreens I’ve seen. It’s also very widely available, but has small packaging at a hefty price tag. The smell is amazing as far as sunscreens go (again I love the smell of sunscreens), and it has a very white color that goes away pretty quickly. It is a liquid sunscreen that comes in a serum bottle with a dropper. Because of it being a liquid, I find it sometimes difficult to disperse as it doesn’t quite sink in, or rather have the sensation of sinking in like other, thicker sunscreens have. It stays true to its breakout-proof promise, but I find that it isn’t dry to the touch and will get progressively oilier throughout the day. It makes your pores look super healthy, and gives you a hydrated, dewy finish, though! \n\nSupergoop’s Every. Single. Face. Watery Lotion SPF 50\n\n1.5/5\n\nThis is one of the worst sunscreens I’ve tried because it is both very moisturizing \\*and\\* heavy on the alcohol. It dries you out \\*and\\* leaves you with a visibly oily finish. This could be the perfect sunscreen for someone, though, as it is a lovely consistency, smells pretty nice, and has absolutely no white cast. My skin just kind of hated it haha. \n\nEtude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++\n\n4/5\n\nI love this one, and got it at a really decent price on sale recently. It is thoroughly moisturizing, has an interesting creamy texture I don’t see often, and has no white cast. When it is on your skin and needs to be rubbed in, it’s already basically clear. Once on, it dries down and leaves no visible oiliness at all, seemingly right off the bat; while leaving my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout most of the day. I’ve noticed this has a tendency to dry out my skin as I get towards the end of the day, though, so I am giving it a 4/5 despite it checking almost every box.\n\nBlack Girl Sunscreen’s Make It Matte SPF 45\n\n4.75/5\n\nThis is a dupe of the Unseen Sunscreen with a more basic ingredient list. I see this as a good thing, though. This kind of sunscreen is popular for a very good reason - it is visibly mattifying while also pulling off the cool feat of being completely clear. It is very moisturizing, and I’ve never experienced any issues after wearing it throughout the day of getting more oily or more dry. I also find this kind of formulation to be the one of the best as it never dries out my skin or leaves it more oily - it is all pros and no cons as far as skin health goes. The only problem is that it tends to just sit there, so despite being matte *looking*, my skin is never dry to the touch. This used to have awful packaging that broke over anything, but they’ve fixed it and it’s still readily available at Target in the US.\n\nSupergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40\n\n3.5/5\n\nThis is almost the same thing as the above but quite literally double the price. Same exact experience with both products tbh.\n\nBiore’s UV Kids Pure Milk Sunscreen SPF50 PA+++\n\n4.5/5\n\nI love this sunscreen, and consider it one of the best mineral sunscreens I’ve used. It obviously leaves a white cast, and this is an aspect I’ve made peace with. Ever since getting into skincare, my skin has been very white, anyway, so this has a strangely tone-evening effect for me. It tends to pill up on itself and will flake off throughout the day sometimes, but these are rare occasions - the cause of which I haven’t quite identified. It has a beautiful, milky texture, and makes your skin have this smooth and soft effect that I can’t quite describe. I find my skin always looks much better after using this and feels so effing smooth while I am taking it off with an oil cleanser. I consider it a treatment of sorts, to be honest. It has become such a staple for me since getting it that I can’t help but overlook some of its flaws.\n\nGlow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Sunscreen SPF 50\n\n4.25/5\n\nThis is a great American sunscreen, and like the Zitsticka one, it is a hybrid sunscreen. This is far more noticeably here as you really do have to work it in to get rid of the cast, which makes sense since it has over quadruple the zinc oxide content. This truly does make you glow, though; and while I am not sure, it feels like there’s some kind of glittery material because it really does do the thing better than any other sunscreen on this list. I’d compare it to the Zitsticka sunscreen and the LRP one above in terms of glow as well as finish as this never becomes dry to the touch. This has fragrance in it, and to be honest it’s all the better for it. Combining the smell of sunscreen and watermelon was something I was so grateful to them for - they should sell it as a perfume.\n\nThe Ordinary’s UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants:\n\n3.25/5\n\nThis is fine, and I honestly don’t have much to say about it in their direction. It has a heavy white cast, which….. while we all know to expect that out of mineral sunscreens, this has a worse one than any of the others on this list, and has at the same time the lowest SPF rating. It even has a tint to it, so it’s just weird how white it goes on. This is a bit too drying for me, but the glow it provides is very specific. Like it is completely dry on your face, but looks like a highlighter it provides so much glow. I was hoping that since the ingredient list is so heavy on antioxidants and amino acids that this would be a cool upgrade to my Biore “treatment” sunscreen, but it is definitely a downgrade overall. It is so cheap, though, and it’s really not a bad product at all. If you have a whiter skin tone and have oily skin, I’d try this one out.\n\nI mentioned that I like my skin to look aggressively hydrated and glowy while also being dry to the touch. I am high maintenance - whatever. I am going to rank the top 5 in how well they achieve this effect on my skin while having no other disqualifying flaws.\n\n1. 9wishes - Pine Treatment Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++\n2. Skin1004’s Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum\n3. iUNIK’s Centella Calming Daily Sunscreen\n4. Canmake’s Mermaid Gel UV Clear\n5. Etude House - Soon Jung X Director's Moisture Sun Cream\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and have a lovely day!",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm really excited about this section. I'm not happy that Korea is and has been for years, swamped in pollution from the winds carrying it over. There is a lot of microdust and even people with resilient skin reported getting redness & severe irritation from the pollution. Everyone has to wear these giant masks, sometimes special ones, and limit their exposure to the world outside of their homes.*\n\n*So there has been a lot of push for soothing, calming products and \"clean\" ingredients. A lot more focus on repairing the skin barrier. So I'm excited about those, but not the fact that people have to suffer.*\n\n*I'll be bolding some of the soothing, repairing and/or skin-identical ingredients in the ingredient lists. I don't know every good ingredient, but I will bold the ones that I do know of. Some other beneficial ingredients as well.*\n\n*\\*Also got random pictures of the textures of the creams and the users who posted it.*\n\n*If you're interested in barrier repairing/replenishing as I am, here are some good quotes from Susan, from Swift Crafty Monkey blog:*\n\n>**Natural moisturizing factor (NMF)** is found within the corneocytes, and makes up 20% to 30% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum. It **consists of amino acids (40%), sodium PCA (12%), lactate (12%), urea (7%), ions (18.5%), sugars (like glycerol – 8.5%)**, and a few other things. These are water soluble [humectants](https://swiftcraftymonkey.blog/better-crafting-through-chemistry/) (meaning they draw water out of the atmosphere to our skin) that have a huge impact on the biochemical and mechanical properties of our skin. Having an adequate NMF level in our skin can prevent or reduce skin tightness, cracking, scaling, and flaking. It improves our skin’s plasticity (thanks to the interactions of the amino acids with keratin) and helps maintain skin’s barrier properties.  \n>  \n>**Filaggrin** is a really important protein found in our skin! ...When we are in more arid climates, the filaggrin breakdown increases to produce more NMF. More NMF is a good thing!  \n>  \n>The contents of the NMF do more than act as humectants. The lactate and potassium can affect the pH and stiffness of the stratum corneum. The lactic acid stimulates ceramide biosynthesis and improves barrier function. The [hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) (HA – picture to the left) maintains hydration and structural integrity of our skin. It also interacts with intercellular lipids and regulates the mechanical properties of the stratum corneum.  \n>  \n>\\[The strateum corneum lipids\\] make up about 15% of the dry weight of the stratum corneum, and contain about **40% to 50% ceramides, 20% to 25% cholesterol, 15% to 25% fatty acids** (those with C16 to C30 chain lengths, with C24 to C28 being the most common), and **5% to 10% cholesterol sulfate**.  \n>  \n>Oils with **linoleic or gamma-linoleic acid** are always welcomed by our skin (like sunflower, sesame seed, borage, evening primrose, rice bran, and others), especially in the winter.\n\n**Squalane, beeswax, lecithin, lanolin** are also good skin replenishing ingredients. Shea butter is very soothing and moisturizing, as well as having a lot of antioxidants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOP CREAMS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1. \\[Dr. G\\] Red Blemish Clear Soothing Cream - 4.22/5 (9,894 Reviews)**\n\n70ml/36,000 KRW - $31.29\n\nWater (Aqua/Eau), **Glycerin**, Butylene Glycol, C 13-16 Isoparaffin, **Niacinamide**, C 12-14 Isoparaffin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Pentylene Glycol, Vinyl Dimethicone, Caprylyl Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Panthenol**, Acrylates/C 10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Dimethiconol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Tromethamine, **Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,** Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, **Beta-Glucan, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside,** Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Epigallocatechin Gallate, **Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Madecassic Acid.**\n\n*This line from this brand is extremely well-known and popular in Korea.

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out the Western Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/fz2l58/list_of_panthenol_products_western_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ -

Types of Hair Problems (3 Main Areas)\n\nAll common hair problems fall into one of these:\n\n1. **Hair Roots (Hair Below the Scalp)** – Hair fall, thinning, reduced density\n2. **Hair Strands (Hair Above the Scalp)** – Dryness, breakage, roughness\n3. **Scalp Issues** – Dandruff, oiliness, itching, inflammation\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧠 2. Hair Root Care – Stop Hair Fall & Grow Stronger Hair\n\nHair fall starts when hair roots weaken or hair becomes thinner. If ignored, it leads to visible scalp and low density.\n\n🛑 **Step 1: Block DHT**\n\n* **Finasteride 1 mg/day** (tablet or topical): Blocks DHT (main reason for male hair loss).\n* Recommended if hair loss is **Stage 2 or more** on Norwood scale.\n\n**💉 Step 2: Improve Blood Flow to Hair Roots**\n\n* **Minoxidil 5%**: Increases blood supply to hair follicles, delivering more nutrients.\n* Apply once or twice daily.\n* For very early hair fall (Stage 1–2), some doctors prefer starting with **caffeine-based or peptide serums** first.\n\n**💊 Step 3: Provide Proper Nutrients**\n\nEven if blood supply increases, without the right nutrients, hair won’t grow strong. Include:\n\n|Supplement|Benefit|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Biotin**|Strengthens hair strands|\n|**Multivitamin (with Zinc, Vitamin D, and B-complex)**|Fixes hidden deficiencies|\n|**Omega-3 or Fish Oil**|Reduces inflammation, nourishes follicles|\n\n**🧪 Step 4: Peptide-Based Serums (for Root Stimulation)**\n\nThese serums contain **plant-based peptides and natural growth factors** that help activate weak or resting follicles without the side effects of stronger medications.\n\n|Serum|Key Ingredients|Benefits|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Redensyl**|DHQG + EGCG2|Activates hair stem cells, reduces hair fall|\n|**Capixyl**|Biomimetic peptide + red clover|Strengthens follicles, reduces inflammation|\n|**Anagain**|Pea sprout extract|Extends hair growth phase (anagen)|\n|**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide Hair Serum**|Blend of multiple peptides|Boosts density, nourishes scalp|\n\n✅ Best used **once daily** on a dry scalp.

Hair Strand Care – Improve Hair Texture, Strength & Shine\n\nThis is the visible part of hair above the scalp. You need to:\n\n**🧴 Use Hair Oil (Carefully)**\n\n* Oil gives moisture and reduces breakage.\n* But **avoid putting oil on the scalp** too often — it can cause dandruff or feed fungus.\n* Apply oil **only on the hair length**, 1–2 times a week, and **wash off properly**.\n\n**🧼 Use Conditioner (Not on Scalp)**\n\n* After shampoo, apply conditioner **only on hair strands** to reduce dryness and tangles.\n\n**💆 Use Hair Mask (Deep Conditioning Treatment)**\n\nHair masks are like super-conditioners. Use them 1–2 times a week to:\n\n* Deeply moisturize dry hair\n* Make hair soft, smooth, and shiny\n* Reduce frizz and split ends\n\n🧴 Choose masks with ingredients like coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter, keratin, or aloe vera.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 🧴 4.

Hard Water vs Soft Water\n\n# 🔹 Hard Water (contains high levels of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Leaves behind mineral deposits on hair strands.\n   * Causes **dry, rough, dull, and brittle hair**.\n   * Can lead to **more hair breakage and tangling**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * **Clogs scalp pores**, leading to dandruff or scalp acne.\n   * May cause **itching or irritation**.\n   * Reduces the effectiveness of shampoo and conditioner (hair doesn’t feel clean).\n\n# 🔹 Soft Water (low mineral content):\n\n* **Effects on Hair:**\n   * Makes hair feel **softer and smoother**.\n   * Helps shampoos and conditioners work better.\n   * Prevents mineral buildup, making hair **shinier and more manageable**.\n* **Effects on Scalp:**\n   * Gentle on the scalp.\n   * Helps maintain **natural oil balance**.\n\n# 🌡️ 2. Water Temperature\n\n* **Hot Water:**\n   * Strips natural oils from hair and scalp.\n   * Can cause **dryness, itching, and frizz**.\n   * May weaken hair roots over time.\n* **Cold or Lukewarm Water:**\n   * Retains natural oils.\n   * Helps **seal the hair cuticle**, making hair shinier and smoother.\n   * Best for the final rinse.\n\n# 🧪 3. Chlorinated Water (Swimming Pools)\n\n* Damages the hair shaft.\n* Causes **dryness, discoloration (especially in colored hair), and split ends**.\n* Irritates the scalp and worsens **scalp sensitivity or dandruff**.\n\n# ✅ Solutions if You Have Hard Water\n\n* Install a **shower filter** that removes minerals and chlorine. (or use filtered water from water purifier only for hair wash)\n* Use **chelating or clarifying shampoos** once a week (they remove mineral buildup).\n* Rinse with **apple cider vinegar + water (1:4 ratio)** to remove residue.\n* Apply **deep conditioning masks** to restore moisture.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# # Is Finasteride Safe? Can You Take It Without Doctor Consultation?\n\n**Finasteride** (commonly used for male pattern baldness at **1 mg/day**) is generally **effective and relatively safe** when taken correctly - but **it should NOT be taken without a doctor’s consultation**, especially for long-term use.\n\n# 🔍 Why You Need Doctor Consultation\n\nFinasteride changes your **hormone levels** by reducing DHT (dihydrotestosterone), the hormone responsible for hair loss. Since it alters your body's chemistry, a doctor should:\n\n* Assess if it’s safe based on your medical history\n* Decide the right **dose** and **form** (oral vs. topical)\n* Monitor side effects and hormone balance\n\n# ✅ Is Low-Dose Finasteride (1 mg/day) Safe?\n\nYes, **low-dose Finasteride (1 mg/day)** is considered **relatively safe for most healthy adult men**, especially under medical guidance. In fact, this is the **standard dose** used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness).\n\nBut even low doses **can have side effects**—though not everyone experiences them.\n\n# ⚠️ Common Side Effects (in 1–10% of users)\n\n* Low libido (reduced sexual desire)\n* Erectile dysfunction\n* Reduced semen volume\n* Breast tenderness or enlargement\n* Depression or mood changes\n\nThese are often **mild and reversible** if the drug is stopped.\n\n# ⚠️ Rare but Serious Risks\n\n* **Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)** – Persistent sexual, neurological, or psychological symptoms after stopping (very rare, still debated)\n* Gynecomastia (male breast growth)\n* Severe depression or anxiety (in rare cases)\n\n# 👨‍⚕️ Who Should Avoid Finasteride Without Supervision\n\n* People with **liver issues**\n* History of **depression or sexual dysfunction**\n* **Those planning to conceive soon** (Finasteride may affect sperm in rare cases)\n* **Women and children** (especially pregnant women)\n\n# 🔍 Monitoring Required If You Take It\n\n* **DHT levels** (optional, but helpful)\n* **Liver function tests**\n* **Prostate exam** (PSA levels can be falsely

This comprehensive guide is the result of that effort. I hope it helps you in your hair care journey.)\n\n(used gpt for help)\n\n(let me know if I have missed anything, I am trying to make a complete guide for hair care)",

        "body": "Please for the love of Hairs, stop asking GPT and Reddit on hair care routine. It never ends well. Consult a proper Dermat (not someone who says to rub oil) and monitor your scalp condition. \n\nWhat has worked for me : \n1. 1mg finasteride orally per day keeps the hair transplant doctor away. ( Only Finasteride/Dutasteride will cure your hairfall issue which is caused by DHT- a useless harmone in adults (useful until puberty passes). \n\n2. Ketoconazole %1 shampoo (%1 is already most effective and strong. Using 2% is overkill unless you suffer from severe case of seborrheic dermatitis. I use it once or twice a week.\n\n3. Never needed topical Minoxidil but it helps only in compliment with Finasteride. Never used minoxidil alone as it does not solve the hairloss issue.\n\n4. I use Tresemme sulphate free shampoo + conditioner for regular use. \n\n5. When I don't use conditioner, I use Kraves wax for styling along with a cold air blower.(Only occasionally)\n\n6. I don't use any oils because my scalp is oily. Applying more will worsen the dandruff problem. \n\n\nThings to Note : \n1. No other serum works unless it does have proper clinical trials and meta analysis studies on it.\n\n2. Never fall for all natural and organic scams. They do not work. be skeptical. Never be blinded by a brand and Fake doctors who claim ridiculous 'CURES'. They do so because people fear drugs and they don't have any evidence or proof of the efficacy. \n\n3. Depending on food and diet as your only way to fight the Slap head curse is a bad idea. Food is food not a medicine. Just because our ancestors used it, does not mean it's good. Our ancestors did not have knowledge nor the protocols for developing cures and conducting clinical trials. \nThe most heinous diseases like TB black death, Hairloss etc have been cured by Pharmaceuticals. So don't fear drugs.\n\n4. DON'T use microneedling. It will cause scar tissue in your scalp which will permanently remove any chance of you growing new hair in that area.\n\n5. Exercise is a must. Never skip a leg day.",

        "body": "Errors in your guide which even ChatGPT cannot correct. Hence why you should not use it as a personal doctor. Allow me to correct it from using what is proven and in accordance with my knowledge. \n\nA) In section 1. Types of Hair problems. The root cause of both hairloss, hair thinning, breakage and Density is all causes by DHT. DHT is a useless harmone in adults which is converted from testosterone (good harmone) with an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5AR). So all those problems are solved by Finasteride which is 5AR1 inhibitor.\nRegarding scalp with dandruff and flaking problem - 1% ketoconazole is enough. \nAnd that is all \n\nReferences:\n\n1) Shin J, Chung E, Kim M, Kim T, Kim W, Huh C. Evaluation of long‐term efficacy of finasteride in Korean men with androgenetic alopecia using the basic and specific classification system.

This is all you need to solve all the problems mentioned in section 1. \n\nB) Bloodflow Theory - This theory stated a century ago that bludflow restriction caused by wearing tight hats and creating tension in scalp is the reason for male pattern baldness. this theory has been overused till this day to sell Nonsense products. This theory has been debunked over century ago (1916) by Dorothy Osborn. \n\nReferences : \n1) Osborn D. INHERITANCE OF BALDNESS. Journal of Heredity. 1916;7(8):347-355. doi:10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110746\n\n2) Nor does wearing Hats or Helmets cause any damage to hair. Here is the study : \nTellez-Segura R. Involvement of Mechanical Stress in Androgenetic Alopecia. Int J Trichology. 2015;7(3):95-99. doi:10.4103/0974-7753.167468 \n\n3) Shoemaker JK, Tiidus PM, Mader R.

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997;29(5):610-614. doi:10.1097/00005768-199705000-00004\n\nConclusion : Never drive bike without Helmet and caps when going out in sun without any worries of Bludflow. \n\nC) Supplements are called supplements because they are not FDA approved. When it is not FDA approved, companies can put anything in it without having to disclose the proper composition. So it's best to avoid them or take FDA approved vitamins. Imo just finasteride is enough to solve all hairloss problems. \n\nD) Microneedling does not work as a standalone treatment nor is it safe as a long term usage. it is observed in 3 studies that Microneedling combined with  topical 5%minoxidil has more efficacy than just standalone microneedling and topical minoxidil. This is because the efficacy of minoxidil increases due to channels in epidermis caused by microneedling. \nThere is no standardized protocol for microneedling, so anyone can just dismiss the ineffectiveness of microneedling using No-true Scotsman falacy even when there is compelling evidence to prove otherwise. \nBasically Microneedling is causing inflammation in the scalp and in long term it will become chronic inflammation. Ultimately creating Scar tissue in scalp resulting in a similar situation to what androgenetic alopecia does to scalp. \nI.e back to square one.\nApplying Tretinoin is better than microneedling along with minoxidil to give maximum benefits to hair growth.\n\nReferences: \n1) Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span\nDavid Furman et al. Nat Med. 2019 Dec.\n\n2) Unusual Presentation of Tinea Corporis Associated With the Use of a Microneedling Device\nNélia Margarida Martins da Cunha et al. Aesthet Surg J. 2017.\n\nE) Stop using oils if your scalp is already oily. Adding more oils will not benifit in any way. It may even create more grounds for fungal infections.",

I feel like scratching my head and have lost some hair and it became patchy on one side where I scratched. I don’t see hair follicles there and I am afraid it’s permanent. Not sure if that hair will come back, hope its a temporary hair loss.\nwhat should be the length of hair I should keep so that its easy for me to clean. I feel like going bald, so that atleast i know where the flakes are and I clean it properly.\n\nAlso what should be the length of hair one should keep optimal for applying all the above treatments like minoxidil, dermaroller. Is a normal dermaroller better or something like dermapen is useful. Can you use same dermaroller on face after cleaning.",

Afterwards I stand in front of a chrome and acrylic Washmobile bathroom sink - with soap dish, cup holder, and railings that serve as towel bars, which I bought at Hastings Tile to use while the marble sinks I ordered from Finland are being sanded - and stare at my reflection with the ice pack still on. I pour some Plax antiplaque formula into a stainless-steel tumbler and swish it around my mouth for thirty seconds.\n\nThen I squeeze Rembrandt onto a faux- tortoiseshell toothbrush and start brushing my teeth (too hung over to floss properly - but maybe I flossed before bed last night?) and rinse with Listerine. Then I inspect my hands and use a nailbrush. I take the ice-pack mask off and use a deep-pore cleanser lotion, then an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I check my toenails. Then I use the Probright tooth polisher and next the Interplak tooth polisher (this in addition to the toothbrush) which has a speed of 4200 rpm and reverses direction forty-six times per second; the larger tufts clean between teeth and massage the gums while the short ones scrub the tooth surfaces. I rinse again, with Cepacol. I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub.\nThe shower has a universal all-directional shower head that adjusts within a thirty-inch vertical range. It's made from Australian gold-black brass and covered with a white enamel finish. In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older. The conditioner is also good - silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older.\n\nOn weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs. Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale's or Bergdorf's and on Evelyn's advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation.\n\nOnce out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair. Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it - preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers - which I've found makes removing the hair easier. It also helps prevent water from evaporating and reduces friction between your skin and the blade. Always wet the razor with warm water before shaving and shave in the direction the beard grows, pressing gently on the skin. Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting. Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin.\n\nApplying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture. Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky - which makes it look dull and older - use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker). Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing \"protective\" lotion. A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural- bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/c2jCMqD",

I know there are some options from Sidmool, Nature Republic, Cosrx and Purito.\n\nAnd now there are two more! 2sol came up with two serums recently with 10&#37; of it:\n\n1. [**2Sol Facial Recovery Booster**](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240003) **10% Niacinamide +  Vitamin C derivative and Panthenol 10% in total.** 30ml drop bottle\n\n\\*Purified water, niacinamide (10&#37;), 2-O-ethyl ascorbic acid, panthenol, butylene glycol, ascorbyl glucoside, dipropylene glycol, 1,2-hexanediol, glycerin, glycereth-26, palmitoyldipeptide-7, palmitoyltripeptide-1, palmitoyltetrapeptide-7, palmitoylhexapeptide-12, , Mictricaria extract, chestnut tree extract, saccharide isomerate, acetylglucosamine, tromethamine, glyceryl acrylate / acrylic acid copolymer, xanthan gum, allantoin, sodium hyaluronate, PVEM / EEE polymer, ethylhexyl glycerin, disodium dipentaerythritol\n\n\\**Unfortunately 2sol states their ingredients as a pic on Korean, so this list I took from one of the ebay sellers*\n\n2. [**2Sol Niacinamide 10% Treatment** ](http://www.2sol.co.kr/shop/item.php?gid=1804240002)**10% Niacinamide + 1% of D-panthenol. 30ml drop bottle**\n\n*I could not find the full ingredient list so far*\n\nAnd as always, these products from 2sol are fairly priced: 8900 won and 5900 won (around $8 and $5). But of course there will be some extra charges.\n\nI'll try to find or translate the full ingredients lists over the next few days.",

More isn't always better! Same goes to retinol/tret, vit C, AHA/BHA, and basically any active you can find... lol",

In the meantime, let's start the weekend with another addition to our growing Skincare Guide, last week was about treating [dark spots and hyperpigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackskincare/comments/1ftgjq0/skincare%5C_guide%5C_dark%5C_spots%5C_and%5C_hyperpigmation/?utm%5C_source=share&utm%5C_medium=web3x&utm%5C_name=web3xcss&utm%5C_term=1&utm%5C_content=share%5C_button). This week's all about helping you build your routine, so you can live your best skin life!\n\nPlease share any feedback, and comment below.\n  \n*As always, please report any bullying or inappropriate comments, that's not the energy we want in our sub.*\n\n--Nat\n\n-----------------\n\n#🛠️Building Your Foundation\n\nThe foundation of all happy and healthy skin (outside of diet) is a solid routine. Whether you wish to treat texture, acne, or fine lines; building a skincare routine involves focusing on hydration, moderation, proper cleansing, and protection.\n\n This is a basic routine guide that can be adjusted based on your skin type and budget. The foundation of any routine consists of a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen at its core. We aren’t thinking about treatment for skin issues just yet, this is for basic hygiene maintenance. Default to this if experiencing reactions or a compromised skin barrier. Omit all harsh products, no actives, no scrubs, or peels. Sometimes you might even need to skip sunscreen depending on how irritated your skin is.\n\n**Core routine = Cleanser, moisturize, and sunscreen**\n\n*This contains no actives as I want the focus to be on a gentle and barrier-friendly approach. You'll be using this daily, so we mustn't have any products that aren't okay for daily usage and can dry out the skin, adding more to your plate. Less is more.*\n\n#Understand Your Skin Type\n\n*First, identify your skin type (dry, oily, combination, normal, or sensitive).*\n\n- **Oily Skin:** Characterized by a higher-than-average production of sebum, skin’s natural oil. This excess oiliness can make the skin appear shiny or greasy and is often accompanied by skin concerns like blackheads and enlarged pores. As clogged pores are a major contributor to breakouts, those with oily skin may also be prone to breakouts. Requires lightweight hydration and oil control, and can be dehydrated.\n\n- **Dry Skin:** The opposite of oily skin—it’s skin that doesn’t have *enough* oil. It may look dull or feel tight, while severe dryness can cause the skin to crack, flake, or peel. Dry skin and dehydrated skin are sometimes used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing—dehydration is a lack of water, and that can happen to anyone, regardless of skin type. Needs rich or layered hydration and moisture retention.\n\n- **Combination Skin:** Displays two or more defining characteristics—like dryness and oiliness—in different areas. Oftentimes, people with combination skin will have an oilier T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin), while their cheeks will be drier. Needs balancing products, and hydrating dry areas without making oily areas greasier.\n\n- **Sensitive Skin:** Characterized by a heightened sensitivity to stressors, including some skincare products. Degrees of sensitivity can vary: Some people only experience mild irritation when exposed to stressors, while others struggle with redness, itching, and discomfort regularly. That being said, sensitivity isn’t always visible—sometimes, it’s just about how the skin feels. Needs gentle, non-irritating products. No to low fragrances/essential oils (though this should be applied to all skin types).\n\n\n\n\n#🛢️Step 0: Oil Cleansing or Micellar Water\n\n*Why should you use either? What are the benefits?*  \nIt can be hard to wash off sunscreen, especially water-resistant ones, or makeup with just your cleanser, the process will eat up the product, likely irritate your skin, or you’ll be left with residue that’ll cause breakouts. Using either an oil cleanser or micellar water makes the process effortless and effective. Moreover, specifically in the case of oil cleansing, it can help loosen clogged pores, so blackheads can be removed and sebaceous filaments (*found on places like your nose and chin*) can be reduced. Remember to always follow up with your second cleanser!\n\n❌ **Did you know not all oil cleansers are oil cleansers?** ❌  \n*As crazy as that sounds some “oil cleansers” are just gentle cleansers that are formulated to look like oil and have the texture of an oil cleanser. CeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser isn’t an oil cleanser, it’s a cleanser. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Gentle Foaming Cleansing Oil, yup, not an oil cleanser too! So, how do you tell, look at the ingredient list if it says water you have your answer. A true oil cleanser contains no water.*  \n   \n**Pro tips:** Always apply to dry skin. If skin is congested, massage with an oil for a few minutes and follow up with a BHA or AHA cleanser.\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Unrefined and Cold-Pressed Jojoba Oil**\n\n**Dermalogica Precleanse Oil Cleanser** (though I wish it was made without the essential oils)\n\n**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil**\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Naturium Purple Ginseng Cleansing Balm**\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Makeup Remover Cleansing Balm** (no fragrance)\n\n**e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\n**CeraVe Micellar Water Facial Cleanser**\n\n**Bioderma Hydrabio (dry skin) or Sensibio (sensitive) H2O Micellar Water**( my personal favorites)\n\n\n\n\n#🫧Step 1: Cleanser\n\n**Purpose:** Cleansing removes dirt, oil, and impurities.\n\n**What to look for:** Sulfate-free products with ingredients like **Glycerin** or **Ceramides** or **Panthenol** or **Niacinamide** or **Allantoin** or **Colloidal Oatmeal** to name a few.\n\n**Types**: Cream, low to no foaming cleansers for dry skin, normal, and sensitive skin. Gel or foaming cleansers for oily/combination and normal skin. All skin types can benefit from a non-foaming cleanser, I highly recommend Jelly Joker by Geek and Gorgeous.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, creamy version**\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**\n\n**Geek and Gorgeous Jelly Joker (doesn’t foam)**\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Low pH Rice Bar**\n\n**Aveeno Positively Radiant Brightening Cleanser**\n\n**Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin Gel Cleanser**\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash**\n\n**La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n**La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP + Gentle Foaming Moisturizing Wash**\n\n**Good Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel**\n\n\n#💧Step 2: Toner (Optional)\n\n**Purpose:** Can be used to help balance the skin’s pH, add a layer of hydration, prep the skin for following serums and treatments, or as a treatment.\n\n**Types:** You have a liquid that ranges from water consistency to a creamier watery consistency like clam chowder. Or toner pads that double as exfoliation, physical and chemical (if it contains actives).\n\n**What to look for:** Choose toners with good fatty alcohols like, **Lauryl, Myristyl, Cetyl, and Stearyl**. Hydrating or soothing ingredients, like **Glycerin**, **Ceramides**, **Panthenol**, **Niacinamide**,**Rose Water**, **Green Tea**, or **Hyaluronic Acid**.\n\n⚠️Be on the lookout for harsh toners with drying alcohols, like **SD alcohol**, **Ethanol**,  **Ethyl**, **Isopropyl**, and **methanol** alcohol (hand sanitizer), which can irritate and dry out the skin.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n*These are only gentle toners, no actives*\n\n **Paulas Choice Advanced Replenishing Toner**\n\n**Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner**\n\n**Etude House Soonjung pH5.5 Toner**\n\n**Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**\n\n**Dermalogica Ultra-Calming Toner**\n\n**Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus**\n\n**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Toner**\n\n**Heritage Store Rosewater & Glycerin Hydrating Facial Mist**\n\n\n#🧪Step 3: Serum/Ampoules\n*no actives*\n\n*This part of your routine should be used to soothe, hydrate, and nourish your skin either before you use your actives or after, depending on the product type. A strong healthy skin barrier means less chance of breakouts and irritation.*\n\n**Purpose:** Serums target specific concerns like dryness, hyperpigmentation, dullness, or uneven texture. They can be lightweight, creamy, water-based, or oil-based.\n\n**What to look for:** Soothing, hydrating calming ingredients. Just like what was suggested previously. **Glycerin**, **Ceramides**, **Panthenol**, **Niacinamide**, **Green Tea**, or **Hyaluronic Acid**.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Good Molecules Niacinamide serum**\n\n**Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum**\n\n**Cosrx Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule**\n\n**Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule**\n\n**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + HA Serum**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 5% Face and Body Emulsion**\n\n**The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5**\n\n\n\n#🧴Step 4: Moisturizer\n\n**Purpose:** *Moisturizers lock in hydration and protect the skin barrier.*\n\n**Pro tip:** Opt for a *rich moisturizer* and layered hydration for dry skin. For oily skin, gel-based moisturizers with non-comedogenic ingredients work well to avoid clogging pores and avoid over cleansing. \n\n**Key ingredients include:**\n\n**Colloidal Oatmeal:** Soothing and anti-inflammatory properties can help treat redness and inflammation.  \n\n- **Ceramides:** Help restore and improve the skin's barrier to lock in moisture and prevent dryness. \n\n- **Squalane:** Helps increase hydration and has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n- **Panthenol:** A provitamin B5 derivative, is recognized for its moisturizing, soothing, and skin barrier‐enhancing properties, \n\n- **Niacinamide:** Barrier supporting, sebum regulator, helps with dark spots and evening out skin tone.\n\n- **Hyaluronic acid:** For hydration and plumping the skin.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Aveeno Calm + Restore  Oat Gel Moisturizer**\n\n**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n**Neutrogena Fragrance-free Daily Moisturizer**\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizer**\n\n**CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel Moisturizer**\n\n**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Moisturizer**\n\n**Vanicream Daily Moisturizer** \n\n**Olay Regenerist  Regenerating Serum Moisturizer**\n\n\n#☀️Step 5: Sunscreen\n\n - **Purpose:** Sunscreen protects against UV rays, prevents hyperpigmentation, and protects and maintains your results.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 or 50** This one has a little bit of a white cast, nothing crazy, hydrating, and consistency like lotion.\n\n**Kiehl’s Better Screen UV Serum** has zero white cast, but it isn’t water resistant. Hydrating but not heavy, combo or dry.\n\n**Neutrogena Invisible Daily Defense** no white cast, hydrating, some might not like the bit of shine from it but I fix that with powder. Thin consistency.\n\n**Elta MD UV Clear Face Sunscreen SPF 46** Very lightweight, no white cast.\n\n**Supergoop Mineral Matte**, thick and white cast heavy but good for under makeup. No water resistance.\n\n**Supergoop Unseen**, no white cast, feels like a silicone makeup primer, wanted to love this but it made me so greasy and clogged. Water resistant. Thick.\n\n**Supergoop Every. Single. Face Watery Lotion**, some shine but nothing crazy that powder didn’t fix. Water resistant. Thin consistency.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics**, no water resistance, feels like a moisturizer. Thin-ish consistency.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua-Fresh Rice + B5** Seems to be more favorable towards oily skin than the original version.\n\n**Innisfree Daily UV Defense** No water resistance, can double as a moisturizer in some cases. Probably best for dry skin.\n\n#🎯End Result🎯\n\nSo, with your core routine in mind, things should be like this: oil cleanser or micellar water, a cleanser, toner (optional), serum for soothing/hydration (*optional, you can just cleanse and then moisturize on days you rest from actives*), treatment product, moisturizer, sunscreen. These items make up your routine, then you sort into day and night. Be sure to balance between rest days and active days depending on your skin needs and your level of skincare experience.\n\n*Note your treatment product could be in the form of a **serum** (think Good Molecules Niacinamide or The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% Serum) or **toner** (think Paulas Choice 2% BHA) or even **cleanser** (think Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid face wash) or a mask.*\n\n\n#Treating Specific Concerns\n\n *Depending on your skin concerns, add specific treatments to your routine:*\n\n\n##Hyperpigmentation/Dark Spots\n\n   - Ingredients: **Vitamin C**, **niacinamide**, **azelaic acid**, **retinol**.\n\n   - Use treatments with these ingredients in your serum or spot treatments to fade dark spots and even out skin tone.\n\n\n##Acne\n\n   - Ingredients:**Salicylic Acid**, **Mandelic Acid**, **Sulfur**, **Benzoyl Peroxide**, **Retinol**.\n\n\n##Dryness\n\n   - Focus on hydration by layering with products containing **hyaluronic acid**, **glycerin**, **collagen**, **shea butter**, or **cocoa butter**.\n\n\n##Texture Issues\n\n   - Ingredients: **AHAs** (like glycolic or lactic acid) for exfoliation and texture improvement.\n\n   - Chemical exfoliation 2-3 times a week helps to keep skin smooth and radiant.\n\n\n##Exfoliation \n(*1-2 times a week, or more depending on your skincare level*)\n\n   -**Purpose:** Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, improve texture, and keep the skin smooth.\n\n   - Opt for gentle chemical exfoliants like **lactic acid** or **mandelic acid** to avoid irritation, as physical scrubs can be too harsh and cause micro-tears in the skin.\n\n\n#Lifestyle Factors\n\n**Diet and Hydration:** Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and vitamins to support healthy skin from within. Take supplements if you need to. \n\n**Sleep:** Ensure enough sleep to allow your skin to regenerate overnight.\n\n\n#Consistency is Key\n\n*Stick to your routine consistently for a few months to see results. Now isn’t a time to be a product hoe and jump from trend to trend, be loyal to the products as long as they aren’t causing adverse reactions.*\n\n#Additional Considerations:\n\n**Patch Test**: Always patch-test new products to avoid potential irritation.\n\n**Avoid Over-Exfoliation**: Too much exfoliation can irritate and worsen skin issues.",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really helped heal my moisture barrier (too many acids!). Personally, I feel like it's been a bit underrated compared to some other ingredients, along with urea. But I think it's starting to make some headway. :\\^)\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease check out Asian Beauty version of this list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/fz2kw4/list_of_panthenol_products_asian_beauty_version/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Key**\n\nEO = Essential Oil\n\n$ - Very affordable (\\~$1-12)\n\n$$ - Affordable-ish (\\~$13-24)\n\n$$$ - Mid-range (\\~$25-55)\n\n$$$$ - High-end (\\~$56-100)\n\n$$$$$ - Luxury/Medical Grade (\\~$100+)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Disclosed Panthenol %\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5](https://theordinary.deciem.com/product/rdn-amino-acids-b5-30ml?redir=1) (5% panthenol, 17% amino acids)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Gel B5 Pro-Recovery Skincare 40ml](https://www.escentual.com/la-roche-posay/larocheposay072/) ($$) - 5% panthenol, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate, vitamin e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 ($$) - 5% panthenol, shea butter, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, manganese gluconate, copper gluconate ( [https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/](https://www.escentual.com/lrpcicaplastbaume001/) )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [Medisei Panthenol Extra](https://www.ebay.com/itm/PANTHENOL-EXTRA-CREAM-FOR-IRRITATED-SENSITIVE-SKIN-WITH-PANTHENOL-UREA-100ML/263780836273?epid=2260763521&hash=item3d6a9023b1:g:4v0AAOSwZrdbMl27) ($) - 5% panthenol, 5% urea *(Comes in a 100ml tube, very light-weight.

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [€18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [€28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [€34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [€41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

Whether you're a haircare newbie or a pro, you all will find this post helpful.\n\n# **HAIR TYPE:**\n\nKnowing your hair type is crucial for choosing the right products and styling techniques.\n\n# 1. Straight Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Lies flat from root to tip.\n* Naturally shiny due to the even distribution of oils.\n* Can be prone to looking greasy quickly.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a lightweight shampoo to prevent excess oil buildup.\n* Avoid heavy conditioners; opt for lightweight, leave-in conditioners if needed.\n* Regularly trim to avoid split ends.\n\n# 2. Wavy Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Has a natural wave or curl pattern.\n* More volume than straight hair.\n* Can be prone to frizz and dryness.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner to combat dryness.\n* Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl-enhancing cream to define waves.\n* Avoid over-washing; 2-3 times a week is sufficient.\n\n# 3. Curly Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Defined curls or ringlets.\n* More prone to dryness as natural oils struggle to travel down the hair shaft.\n* Can be prone to frizz.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a sulfate-free, moisturizing shampoo to retain natural oils.\n* Deep condition weekly to maintain moisture levels.\n* Use a curl cream or gel to define curls and reduce frizz.\n\n# 4. Coily Hair\n\n**Characteristics**:\n\n* Tight curls or coils.\n* Often very dry and prone to breakage.\n* Shrinks significantly when dry.\n\n**Care Tips**:\n\n* Use a hydrating shampoo and a rich, creamy conditioner.\n* Regularly apply leave-in conditioners and oils to maintain moisture.\n* Avoid heat styling; embrace protective styles like twists or braids.\n\n  \n# **HAIR CONCERNS:** \n\nHere are some specific hair concerns and the active ingredients that can help address them. Understanding which ingredients to look for can make a big difference in tackling your hair issues effectively.\n\n# 1. Dryness\n\n**Concern**: Hair lacks moisture and appears dull and brittle.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Argan Oil**: Rich in fatty acids and vitamin E, deeply moisturizes and adds shine.\n* **Shea Butter**: Provides intense hydration and helps lock in moisture.\n* **Glycerin**: Attracts moisture to the hair and scalp.\n\n# 2. Frizz\n\n**Concern**: Hair is unmanageable and has a rough texture, especially in humid conditions.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Silicones (e.g., Dimethicone)**: Smooth the hair cuticle and reduce frizz.\n* **Keratin**: Strengthens and smooths the hair shaft.\n* **Oils**: Penetrate the hair shaft to provide moisture and reduce frizz.\n\n# 3. Damage\n\n**Concern**: Hair is weak, breaks easily, and may have split ends.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Protein (e.g., Hydrolyzed Keratin, Silk Protein)**: Rebuilds and strengthens the hair structure.\n* **Amino Acids**: Repair and reinforce hair fibers.\n* **Panthenol (Provitamin B5)**: Penetrates hair to provide moisture and improve elasticity.\n\n# 4. Hair Loss\n\n**Concern**: Thinning hair or excessive shedding.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Minoxidil**: FDA-approved treatment that stimulates hair growth.\n* **Biotin**: Supports hair health and growth.\n* **Caffeine**: Stimulates hair follicles to promote growth.\n\n# 5. Dandruff\n\n**Concern**: Flaky, itchy scalp caused by dryness, irritation, or fungal infections.\n\n**Active Ingredients**:\n\n* **Pyrithione Zinc**: Reduces fungal growth and scalp inflammation.\n* **Ketoconazole**: Antifungal that helps treat dandruff.\n* **Salicylic Acid**: Exfoliates the scalp to remove flakes.\n\n# 6.

Oily-Combo Skin that is Acne-Prone\n3. Hot-Humid Weather (Summers/Monsoon) + Cold-Dry Weather (Winters)\n\n*My primary skin concerns are controlling acne and fading PIH from previous zits.*\n\n**✅ How It Went:**\n\nI used this product religiously in the AM as well as PM as directed. 5 drops were enough to cover my face completely.\n\nThis is the first time I am taking skincare seriously and I had no idea how to select products. This product was a complete impulse purchase after being frustrated with my skin for very long (acne + PIH).\n\nThe serum is a milky white colour in the dropper that is barely visible once you take some in your hand.\n\n[All Pictures Included Here](https://imgur.com/a/bZ9Rj3S)\n\nThe consistency of the serum is a little thicker than water. It feels very *slightly* sticky for a couple of seconds when you put it on your skin but absorbs easily (as is expected from a serum).\n\nIn terms of using it under makeup, I never experienced any pilling. The formulation is very light-weight and with this product, you definitely never feel like you are wearing too much on your face.\n\nThe product also **does not contain fragrance** and should not cause irritation to sensitive skin girlies. However, people with niacinamide sensitivity should probably steer clear of this one.\n\n*Overall, in terms of the feel of the product on my face, it's a 5/5.*\n\nHowever, what matters most is the results which is where this product did not perform as I expected.\n\nI have been using this product for exactly 2 months (or 8 weeks) now. The same time period that Suganda claims is needed for this product to show results.\n\nHas this product shown results? I cannot say no. But has it been satisfactory for me? Honestly... Also no.\n\nMaybe this is just a me thing because my acne and PIH are moderately extensive in terms of severity but this product just did not deliver as much as it had promised.\n\nWithin the first month, there was a definite visible difference in my skin. Some of the lighter pigmentation had faded away for sure and my skin looked so much clearer than usual that 2-3 people commented on the difference.\n\nThis gave me a huge boost of confidence in this product and I kept applying it diligently, looking forward to what other changes it'll bring.\n\nHowever, that's where the progress pretty much stopped. Once all of my light pigmentation was sorted, this product became quite useless. For over a month now, there has hardly been any difference in my skin.\n\nIn fact, this serum did not help with some of the deeper pigmentation caused by new acne as well! I got a couple of hormonal acne 2 weeks ago that left behind pretty ugly marks. Unfortunately, this serum has not yet shown any effect on those.\n\nIt was a huge let down, ngl. After one month of miracles, it felt like the product had become a total dud and was not taking me anywhere useful in my skincare journey.\n\nThat's why I gave it an overall rating of 3/5 with a meh review. The initial benefits are great and I have no complaints with how the formula feels on my skin but this is honestly not a product worth the investment when you consider the price point at which it sells.\n\n**✅ In Conclusion:**\n\nIf you are someone who wants to target mild PIH then this serum is the best thing for you! It'll get rid of those pretty quick and you'll see a visible difference within a month.\n\nHowever, for all my acne prone girlies who have seen the ugly side of PIH, this serum would probably not benefit you that much. You might feel encouraged by the initial progress when some of your lighter PIH clears up quickly but trust me, that's the end of the road for this product.\n\nP. S. Since I am not repurchasing this serum, I'm switching to niacinamide from another brand and thinking of adding azelaic acid to my PM routine. Any suggestions for these two? Thanks!",

Plus, always here for combination products with multiple lightening ingredients 🙌🏼\n\n... TBH, two months to fade old acne marks is kind of short 😅 Even with new marks, I've never had a product prevent dark marks from forming, or even treat new marks super fast. The most I've noticed is that the mark isn't AS dark as if I wasn't using products targeting PIH. Still takes time to fade. The brand does mention that you'll see more results with prolonged use in 6 months. \n\nThe only thing that really helped speed things up is using multiple angles - so, lightening products AND exfoliation. A single product alone never gave me dramatic results. And even doing all that, when I'm happy with having some minor acne and PIH at any time, some of my dark marks from really inflamed, deeper pimples have been around for like... five or six months, even 🤔 Like, really faded, but they're still there. Granted, I have slow healing skin, and I'm in my early thirties, but PIH just takes time.\n\nI really enjoyed your review, OP, especially the clear formatting and the images!

    "body": "I've been reading the odd post by others asking this or similar questions over the last few months and I thought I'd post my thoughts. \n\nNow, it comes with a caveat. You do you.  What I do, may not be for you but I want to share what I've done to get to this point. \n\nFirstly, I have hated being circumcised since I worked out I was at 18.  I'm 57.  That's a long long time.  That is why I'm restoring my foreskin. \n\nIf you don't know your why - go work on that.  That's step 1 IMHO.  Without a \"Why\" most don't put in enough consistent effort to achieve results and become stop start restorers or give up. \n\nI also set a goal to do WNBR once I could pass as intact. I did that earlier this year.  Somehow, being stark naked in public with a hoody was really motivating for me. \n\nIt was my late wife who stumbled on restoration while we were researching the negative aspects of circumcision & loss of pleasure. I'm so, so grateful she did and for her love and support in the early days.  \n\nSo,  early November 2016, I begin using manual methods to loosen skin and scar adhesions.  I did that for 18 months without doubting just determined to achieve, but not really believing it was possible.   Results came in more skin.  It was working. I kept going. \n\nI had a small break in early 2018 while we dealt with what eventually sadly took her life. \n\nI then invested in a tlcx and tried that.  I found Reddit and this community in August that year and I soon stumbled over this post by lcburgundy which changed everything for me once I understood the time commitment necessary. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/75ln8h/twoyear_restoration_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share \n\nSo, I got committed. I did 90 day runs, plotted my time and used other devices too. Some days I was under tension one way or another for upwards of 18 hours, never less than 15.  Air, tugging, weights, straps, everything I could use.\n\n17 May 2020, I committed to Andre's method for 90 days.  I added mm2 into that as well. Then I added my own stretch of the scarline, pulling at 90 degrees. \n\nI have stuck to that routine and committed to at least 45 minutes of Andre's method and adding in mm2 and my method cycling it each hour for most days. \n\nIf I can't get hourly in, I'll get 2 hourly in and make up before bedtime. \n\nSure it's inconvenient. Sure it's time consuming. Yes I have to find ways to get the tugs in if I'm out or travelling, which is a little restricted at present, but I do it because I am committed 100% to this. \n\nI use ASEA Renu 28 and Rona Ross D-panthenol cream. \nI've had a few minor skin issues but none since using those products. \n\nSo, that's 57 months of obsessive commitment. \n\nNot convenient, not for everyone but that is how I have grown my foreskin to this point. \n\nSo here is the magic bullet. Stay focused, learn from the resources here and elsewhere and ask questions, ask for help if you need too and for gosh sakes track your time to keep yourself really honest and put in the time commitment necessary.  That's it. \n\nWhen I reflect back, it's how I built a house, renovated countless others, studied for and obtained 2 degrees and built a successful career and grew my foreskin. \n\nHope this helps at least someone reading my drivel.",

Thanks for posting it.\n\nWNBR..... my wife and I were in Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 1, 2015 - Canada Day!. We had just attended the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo, one of those bucket list items for lovers of bagpipes\\*. Got out at about 3pm, found a nice restaurant on the hillside leading up from the harbor, sat on the patio overlooking the road, probably Duke or Prince street. DUKWs full of tourists rumbled past, and in the middle of the meal we hear a commotion from down by the harbor, and then along came a rather slow group of over 50 bicyclists, all naked as a jaybird. Of course, they were pedaling UP the hill, so the procession took several minutes, something that is impossible to un-see.\n\nCheers.\n\n* 2 other great bagpipe events: Edinburgh Tattoo and Highland Games in Antigonish, NS",

    "body": "🦋 **Skin type:** Oily, slightly dehydrated\n\nSensitive (inflammation and acne-prone, malassezia/fungal acne, slow healing), ever present PIH+PIE. Similar issues on my back, mostly closed comedones (clogged pores) and scarring from them.\n\n🦋 **Climate:** Mumbai monsoon. Ranges from slightly cool to slightly warm, humid.\n\n🦋 **Current routine:**\n\nI avoid using shower gel or anything on my back, just plain water. No moisturizer, either (I just do my arms and legs). And use just this glycolic toner on my back on alternate days.\n\n🦋 **Age:** Early 30s\n\n🦋 **Usage timeline:** From Dec 2022 to Oct 2023, used twice a week at first, then alternate days. Finished the 200ml bottle.\n\n#✨️Ingredient list: \n\nAqua/​Water, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Lysine, Histidine, Arginine, Aspartic Acid, Tocopherol, Threonine, Serine, Glutamic Acid, Proline, Glycine, Alanine, Valine, Methionine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Cysteine, Aloe Vera Extract, Oat Extract, Witch Hazel Extract, D-Panthenol, Sodium Gluconate, Hexylene Glycol, Sodium Lactate, Propanediol, Xylitol, Erythritol, Maltitol, Trehalose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride\n\nNotably contains \"17 amino acids\", and a couple soothing ingredients. pH is a low, low 3.6. \n\nI have the old packaging, which unfortunately listed the ingredients out of order, but hopefully the new one corrected that issue.\n\n🦋 **Price:** MRP ₹549 for 200ml, currently available for ₹429 on Amazon. Also available in 100ml pack.\n\n#✨️Texture, consistency and fragrance\n\nHas no added fragrance, but smells distinctly acidic, like apple cider vinegar. Smell doesn't linger, and dissipates fast (can't speak for use on the face), but it may be a turn-off for some people. Not a spa experience, almost medicinal 😂\n\nIt's a watery consistency. A yellow-brown tinted liquid.\n\n🦋 Packaging - a twisting nozzle-top bottle. Very convenient. Easy to use, you can change the rate of dispensing with how much you twist it open (perfect for the watery texture) - all the pros of the Ordinary product (AFAIK) at a lower cost. \n\n#✨️Effects\n\nSinks in fairly quickly on towel-dried skin, and doesn't stain or affect clothing in any way. It's pretty strong, so any scratches or broken skin sting for a bit when applied - getting a little on my underarms post shaving is an immediate emergency rinse 🥵\n\nOver the course of a couple months, it largely resolved my comedonal back acne, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and overall texture on my back. My skin heals pretty slow, so people may see faster results. I still have some comedones, texture etc. on my back, but I'm satisfied with it as is. I think that's realistic results for acne-prone skin. \n\nIt hasn't done much for scar tissue bumps from the ocassional cyst, maybe just softened their appearance slightly.\n\n#✨️My experience and final thoughts\n\nHaving used a spray product for bacne before, I much prefer this packaging. I have mild hand dexterity issues, a spray nozzle gets hard to press repeatedly. As convenient as it sounds in theory, it was also hard to position it so the spray would get on the right areas. This product is easy to just dribble over your shoulders and down your back, then spread with your hands. \n\nThe results were what I expected, so I'm satisfied.\n\n🦋 **Repurchase status:**\n\nWRP - just placed an order for a new one 😂 5/5 for body acne. I'm very basic when it comes to body care, and this is a seamless part of my routine now.\n\nI can't speak to use on the face, of course. It's quite a strong product, and I currently prefer using the Minimalist 10% AHA serum on my face, because it's gentler and has a nicer texture and overall experience. \n\nHope this was interesting and/or helpful ☺️ Byee!",

Personally, I feel like it's a really underrated ingredient, along with urea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently added the ingredient list and pictures into the INCIDecoder online database.

It is extremely soothing on my skin and moisturizes tret face so, so well. Sometimes I like to use it with their eczema therapy balm but that one doesn't have panthenol. \n\nI truly believe that the combination of 1% colloidal oatmeal and high % of panthenol is what helped my skin the most. Petrolatum is also the best TEWL reducing ingredient available today. It's a thick, occlusive cream. Not as sticky as straight-up vaseline, which is what I love about it. I use it as a sleeping pack every night. A super thick layer. \n\nHowever, you either have to use other products that play well with it to slap it on right after, or wait until previous layers are completely absorbed before putting this on, otherwise it pills. \n\nIt comes in 2 oz (called face & hand cream but ingredients are the same), 7.3 oz, and 12 oz.",

    "body": "Hello! I just wanted to share my love for panthenol! It has really, really helped heal my moisture barrier (too much acids!). Personally, I feel like it's a really underrated ingredient, along with urea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Panthenol** is a derivative of Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid). It's readily absorbed by our skin and converted to vitamin b5 since it is naturally produced by our bodies. It's approved by the FDA at 2% and higher for wound healing and anti-itching. It also acts as a humectant, drawing water to the skin. (It's great for hair as well!) So it's really effective for strengthening our skin barrier at 2-5%. It's also a penetration enhancer.\n\nHowever, the studies were all done on products with only little amounts of water in them, so for watery products, you may need it at a higher percentage for it to work better ([Swift Crafty Monkey blog](https://www.swiftcraftymonkey.blog/humectants-panthenol-a-closer-look/)), like at **5-10%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently added the ingredient list and pictures into the INCIDecoder online database.

It is extremely soothing on my skin and moisturizes tret face so, so well. Sometimes I like to use it with their eczema therapy balm but that one doesn't have panthenol.\n\nI truly believe that the combination of 1% colloidal oatmeal and high % of panthenol is what helped my skin the most. Petrolatum is also the best TEWL reducing ingredient available today. It's a thick, occlusive cream. Not as sticky as straight-up vaseline, which is what I love about it. I use it as a sleeping pack every night, right now with the Aveeno eczema balm on top. \n\nUse with other lotions/creams that play well with it or wait until previous layers are absorbed before putting this on, otherwise, it can pill. \n\nIt comes in 2 oz (called face & hand cream but ingredients are the same), 7.3 oz, and 12 oz.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Oops, the boH serum DOES contain fragrance components, sorry!",

    "body": "⚠️ **DISCLAIMER:** Since making this post, I've learned some new information that has changed my perception and usage of the term \"fungal-safe\". I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️\n\n**Skin type:** Oily, sensitive (easily inflamed), acne-prone, usually CCs (clogged pores/closed comedones. Minor PIH and PIE, slow healing because of a minor collagen disorder - and prone to fungal acne. \n\n**Age:** 31\n\n**Climate:** Hot and humid\n\n#My current skincare goals\n\nI'm happy with my routine as it is, but do not have totally clear \"glass skin\", by any means ☺️ My inflammation is well-managed, so my active breakouts are minimal and whatever PIH is formed resolves without getting super dark at any point. I think that's a level of reasonable satisfaction for acne-prone skin.\n\nMy [previous routine post from 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was also interesting for me to read, because it worked pretty well for me at the time. Since then, my skin has gotten slightly more dehydrated, which is natural with age. That got me thinking a little more long-term about how I could best support my skin as I get older.... I guess you could call it \"well-aging\" 😦 But this is the first time I'm realising that 🤣🤣🤣\n\nIt's more just responding to my skin and how it functions in the present. Like, it's pretty thin and turns over really slow, so I figured I'd use AHAs to thicken up the dermis over time, speed turnover, and get it a bit more resilient. In that sense, this is the routine of someone in their 30s who is experiencing a little premature aging 🤔 I know retinoids are the go-to, and maybe I'll go there one day, but I'm still getting occasional laser hair removal sessions on my face. It was the reason I stopped using tretinoin, and now I find myself quite happy and not motivated to do the whole purge thing again just yet 😂\n\nIf you're below your thirties and reading this post, do keep this context in mind 😌❤️ Not everyone \"needs\" to do all of this.\n\n#Morning\n\n**CLEANSER - ⭐️ Simple Refreshing Face Wash *[MRP: ₹385 for 150ml]*  (previously) ⭐️ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash *[MRP: ₹205 for 150ml]* (currently)**\n\nI finished the Simple one a few weeks ago, but it was good while it lasted ☺️👍🏼 One thing I did notice - I've heard many people say it leaves a residue for them. I also noticed this, but figured out that it doesn't happen if you emulsify the product nicely between you palms before face application. Like, wet hands, lather vigorously, then apply. Voila, no residue! \n\nThe Himalaya one was surprisingly comparable and not any more stripping. Maybe they've reformulated slightly in the 7-8 years since I last used it 😂\n\n**SERUM/MOISTURIZER - ⭐️ DIY 15% vitamin C \"serum\"** \n\nI use the Body Cupid aloe gel as a base. Here's a [simplified explanation of how I make my DIY vitamin C](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/so7xlu/whats_your_best_serum_for_am/hw7dpwp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). \n\nI personally think DIYing is the most logical solution to the instability of water-based vitamin C, but I understand many people don't wanna go through the trouble for one reason or another. The bare minimum you'd need to have by way of equipment, IMO, is measuring spoons and litmus paper, and besides, you may feel more secure using a product that's been formulated by experts. For me, this works really well, and I've been using it for over a year. Speeds up my skin's healing from acne, PIH, whatever ❤️\n\nBe forewarned - my skin seems to love L-ascorbic acid, which isn't the case for everyone. And I started out using 7% LAA. Which is the theme of this whole post:\n\n#✨️Start with a low percentage and take it slow✨️\n\n\n**SUNSCREEN - ⭐️ Episoft AC SPF30 if indoors *[MRP: ₹600 for 75g]*/ ⭐️ UVDoux SPF50 PA+++ *[MRP: ₹699 for 50g]* if outdoors**\n\nNot much to say here, Episoft is like a light cream moisturizer, very pleasant. Water-based and not water-resistant, so easily washed off with a single cleanse, cintains D-panthenol (soothing ingredient that helps the skin barrier), so they claim it's anti-acne on the Amazon listing. Why not 🤷🏽‍♀️ It's not considered photostable, so I'm planning to switch to the Vilvah SPF30  for the new filters (will review once I use it!)\n\nUVDoux is a pretty standard silicone-based sunscreen. Water-resistant. Looks and feels like a primer, has a slightly blurring finish that looks matte but isn't dry to the touch. Very slight white cast that disappears over time (I'm around NC4O skin tone, medium). More details about it [in my previous routine post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n#Nighttime\n\n⭐️ **FIRST CLEANSER - DIY Cleansing balm (⚠️ not fungal-safe)**\n\nIf wearing makeup and/or outdoor sunscreen.  [(Instructions for how I make it, here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/pq7szk/how_to_make_a_diy_emulsifying_cleansing_oil/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I will probably be stuck using this for yeeeeears, because I have a shit ton of emulsifying wax left 😂 Thankfully, I don't mind. First cleansers are pretty boring to me.\n\n**SECOND CLEANSER - ⭐️Simple Refreshing Face Wash /⭐️Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash**\n\nIf not wearing makeup and/or UVDoux, this is my only cleansing step. I _have_ accidentally gone in with this on UVDoux before 😂 It doesn't remove it completely, even when used twice.\n \n**TREATMENT PRODUCT - ⭐️ Minimalist AHA BHA 10% Exfoliator *[MRP: ₹599 for 30ml]* (day 1)**\n\nI started out using a DIY 10% lactic acid serum twice a week for a month or so, then got this one. It's a pale yellow serum with a watery consistency. Has a 10% blend of lactic, glycolic and salicylic. Sinks in almost instantly - will leave a full review when I finish the bottle, there's 1/4th left ☺️ I didn't experience any stinging or irritation, perhaps because of my lactic acid use, but I did experience a mild purge with a couple of small inflamed pimples during the first two weeks of use. \n\nSince then, it's a pretty no-fuss experience. I was using, like, half a dropperful, but now I use maybe six drops for the whole face and neck (avoiding the eye area!) and that's just as effective 🙃 I've noticed my skin has become less congested (not as many skin-coloured bumps/closed comedones) and my PIH/PIE has faded and continues to fade faster than it used to. I also get less active acne in general, as a consequence of having less congestion. Very happy with this product and this 3-day cycle! \n\nOR\n\n**Dot & Key Cica 10% niacinamide and alpha arbutin serum [MRP: ₹599 for 30ml] (day 2)**\n\nI _was_ using the old formulation that also had tranexamic acid, but they reformulated and left it out 🥹 The experience of using the product is the exact same, though. [I did a review for the old formulation here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/12euf0p/review_dot_key_cica_10_niacinamide_3_tranexamic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nCannot say I noticed an increase in PIH when I started using the new formulation, because as you can see, I use multiple actives that help with that. This formulation is nice and soothing, possibly because of the oat extract and panthenol. That's why it's day 2 - to mitigate any irritation I may have had from the previous night's AHA use. Big brain 😌\n\nOR \n\n**Aziderm 20% azelaic acid gel *[MRP: ₹310 for 15g]* (⚠️ prescription product - day 3)**\n\nA gel-cream that leaves a matte, slightly powdery finish. I've been using Aziderm (prescribed) for years now. I use one FTU (Finger Tip Unit - a line on your fingertip till the first joint). Recently, my chemist was out of the 20% and 15% and I got the 10%... and for the first time experienced the gritty texture and initial tingling that others on the sub have described?? WTF. Finished the tube (tingling subsided within two uses) and went back to 20%. So weird, because it's totally smooth. No tingles.\n\nA mystery 🧐 Anyway, azelaic acid is probably my favourite all-round ingredient for acne. It both prevents AND treats redness, acne and PIH. It may even help treat PIE (red acne marks) although I've heard mixed opinions from derms about that. \n\nIt can definitely be irritating when you first start using it, so I personally suggest first time users start with an OTC serum, maybe even a potassium diazeloyl glycinate one (PAD - it's an azelaic derivative). Again, START OUT SLOW. And don't use prescription products without derm guidance.\n\n#❤️ _Personal note_\n\nI'm sharing all the details of my fairly complicated and active-heavy routine here, trusting that readers will take my suggestions on how to start just as seriously as any other part of the post. I'm cautious when I start a new product - I'll use it for at least a month before switching or adding anything new. I did that with 10% niacinamide, even. \n\nTWO months if it's an active, like an acid. If I'm still purging or adjusting to a product, I don't add anything new. If I see any signs of irritation, redness or stinging AT ALL, I reduce frequency of use. This happened when I started using the Chemist at Play moisturizer (that I'll mention below) more often. I reduced the frequency back and tried adding it two-three weeks later, when my skin was less sensitive and at a more resilient point in my menstrual cycle (the week after my period ended). Had no isssue at all then. BIG brain 😂\n\nIf you want to know more about how to adjust your skincare to your menstrual cycle to support your skin and minimise acne - I have a [whole detailed post about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/qfhlio/working_with_your_menstrual_cycle_skincare_focus/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I still get a few unavoidable chin pimples at PMS time, but it helps a lot. I also mix zinc oxide into my night moisturizer the week before my period. [Full details on how I use zinc oxide for skin soothing, here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/rs1xk6/how_to_use_zinc_oxide_powder_for_skinsoothing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nSo take it slow, okay? Resist the temptation to wreck your skin and learn the hard way. Don't use my post as inspo to damage your barrier 😂❤️\n\n_Back to the routine!_\n\n⭐️ **MOISTURIZER - Re'equil Pitstop Gel  [MRP: ₹590 for 30g]/Body Cupid aloe  *[MRP: ₹299 for 200ml]* + Luxura Sciences MCT oil *[MRP: ₹399 for 250ml]* (day 1)**\n\nThe Pitstop Gel was a curiosity buy 😂 Its technically a spot tratment product for acne scars. I was pretty excited about having a [whole list of fungal-safe moisturizers to choose from](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/xyrgx8/list_of_fungalsafe_products_2022/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) after having to mix MCT oil into aloe gel for so long, so I got it to try. And it was... fine. \n\nFinished it up, wouldn't repurchase 🙃 The brand claims it works \"both on old and new acne scars\", and the ingredients that are supposed to do that are onion extract, allantoin, panthenol (like in Mederma gel) and daisy and olive extract. Notably, it's silicone-free, which is quite uncommon.\n\nProps to the brand for describing what it looks and feels like (\"clear gel with a yellow tint and has a soothing fragrance\"), but I didn't like the fragrance. It was a little too sweet and strong for me, but it did dissipate fast, so it's not like I had trouble using it up. I just found myself avoiding it slightly 😂 I'm easily overwhelmed by fragrance in general, so that may not be a dealbreaker for everyone. \n\nIt was a nice, smooth gel texture with polymers that helped lock in moisture. Good for oily/combo skin in summer, and oily skin at night. The texture was fine. The main reason I wouldn't repurchase is because the brand suggest to use it 3-4 times a day on scars, and 8-10 weeks for new scars. 3-6 months for old ones. Perhaps there is a consumer out there willing to put these claims to the test. I am not she 😂 It's also pricey to use as a full face moisturizer 🤷🏽‍♀️ Whether it would outperform any suitable moisturizer if used similarly is anyone's guess... \n\nThe Body Cupid aloe gel + few drops of MCT oil is my usual bare-bones fallback for moisturizer ☺️ It's what I currently use.\n\nOR\n\n⭐️ **Chemist at Play 1% Salicylic moisturizer  *[MRP: ₹399 for 45g/46ml]* (day 2 and 3)**\n\nMy interest in multitasking products got me interested in this one. I'm halfway through the bottle, and will do a full review when it's over. The bottle, BTW, is freaking opaque white heavy-ass glass 😱 Looks like plastic in photos 😂 But nope. Very chic pump packaging with a cover for the nozzle, and very chic label graphics. \n\nY'all know Innovist (who do Chemist at Play) is owned by Nykaa now? YouTuber Shreya Jain talked about it in a recent video. Super interesting. Anywho.\n\nThe key ingredients are great on paper - 1% salicylic acid, 2% pentavitin, 0.5% zinc PCA, ubiquinone (aka CoQ10, a soothing antioxidant that's pretty rare to see in products) and phytoceramides. Also silicone-free. The texture is a gel-cream with some thickness to it. It's clearly marketed for oily skin, and I think would be enough for combo skin in summer as well. I use three pumps for face and neck (avoiding the eye area).\n\nI started using it once every three days, and now use it twice. The brand suggest using it twice a day for best results - I'd say this is probably okay for people who aren't using any other actives at all. For those who are, you'll have to keep an eye on your barrier 👀 \n\nOne con was that the ingredient list in one place (I think the Innovist website, can't check because it's out of stock) listed ylang ylang. The product DOES smell of ylang ylang. But it's not listed in the ingredient list on the back of the product 🙃 Have they since reformulated to leave it out? If anybody else owns this product, let us know! The rest I'll share when I do a full review, this is getting super long 😂\n\n***\n\nIf you're interested in how to properly hydrate and/or moisturize your skin while using a fungal-safe routine, I've made a whole post on [moisturizing tips for dry skin and fungal acne/seb derm](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/10cqp2k/moisturizing_tips_for_dry_skin_and_fungal_acneseb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).\n\n#Night routine in order\n\n**DAY 1️⃣ (EXFOLIATION)** - Minimalist AHA BHA 10% Exfoliant on towel-dried face > wait 10-15 minutes, spray hydrating mist to moisten face > Body Cupid aloe + Luxura Sciences MCT oil on whole face including eyes\n\n**DAY 2️⃣ (SOOTHING)** - Dot & Key Cica 10% niacinamide and alpha arbutin serum on fairly wet face (not towel dried) > drop of MCT oil/tiny dab of lanolin around the eyes > Chemist at Play 1% Salicylic moisturizer \n\n**DAY 3️⃣ (ANTI-ACNE/PIH)** - Aziderm 20% azelaic acid gel (⚠️ prescription product) on towel-dried face > wait 10-15 minutes, spray hydrating mist to moisten face > drop of MCT oil/tiny dab of lanolin around the eyes > Chemist at Play 1% Salicylic moisturizer \n\n#Eye and lip care\n\nI use ⭐️ Zenvista pure lanolin [MRP: ₹499 for 100g] (⚠️ not fungal-safe) on my lips at night, right after showering, and often wipe the remainder around my eyes. It's one con to using a moisturizer with actives - gotta do different eye care 😑 Thankfully, I'm getting used to that being a part of my routine. I also use it on my cuticles. The 100g jar I bought at the end of 2020 is still 1/4th full 😂 \n\nIt's a very effective occlusive, and I find it to keep my lips healthy and hydrated all day - when used fresh out of the shower. It's quite stiff and forms a tight film wherever it's applied. Doesn't move or travel around the lips at all, which I really like. It worked great when I had eczema on my upper arms as well. Lanolin is wool wax, so it's not vegan.\n\nIn the daytime, if going outdoors, I use the ⭐️ Malibu Lipcare SPF30 in Vanilla [MRP: ₹299 for 5g]. Been a year since I got it and there's. So. Much. Left. It does tend to leave white crusties on the inner rim of my lips, so I usually apply a touch of makeup on top. Or just have the crusty lips sometimes 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n#DIY hydrating steps\n\nI usually use ⭐️ plain glycerin as a hydrating step if I notice my skin is dehydrated. Using this in summer is a new development this year. Before I turned 31, I didn't notice any dehydration in summer. Luckily it's simple to manage ☺️\n\nBasically spray my face with plain water, take two drops in my wet hands, rub them together and pat all over, then continue with my routine. I also had a lot of ⭐️ xylitol powder lying around, and finished my glycerin, so lately I've been mixing xylitol into water in a spray bottle and keeping that in the fridge to use. I could get a hydrating toner for this step... maybe once I finish all my xylitol 😂\n\n#In conclusion\n\nTo me, the exact products I'm using are of less value and less reason to share than the routine and logic behind why, when and how I use them. So I'd encourage you not to get too caught up on this list as product recommendations 😅 I could find a substitute for pretty much every product here, but it's understanding my skin and how it responds to things that allows for that. \n\nKeep in mind that I've built this routine (and my skin's tolerance to it) over the course of several months now. If any detail seems like something you want to emulate, go ahead and try it - but remember to only pick one and stick with it. Barrier damage can CAUSE acne, and we don't need to go there ☺️\n\nSee you in the comments!",

    "body": "Just wanted to share my experience with y'all. Please note that this is purely anecdotal and YMMV.\n\nI started losing more hair around 2 months after covid recovery. I knew this was the side-effect and not much can be done. But the hairfall started increasing, it was at its peak by month 3. They were falling in bunches, a lot on wash days, so much that I'd postpone hair washing for a week if possible. After a while, I got more worried, did some research, and bought these products.\n\nOther things I did that might also have helped:\n\n\\* Stopped using hair oils completely\n\n\\* Started being gentler with hair, no combing on wet/damp hair (I was using wide tooth combs only, but sometimes used to comb hair while they're damp)\n\n\\* Started washing my hair 2-3 times a week (I have oily scalp, so it suits me well)\n\nAfter more than a month, I'm seeing some positive results. Now my hairfall has reduced to about 100 strands per day. I read that 100 is a normal amount, but it's still more than usual for me. Hope it will soon go back to normal. I don't see any visible regrowth yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHair type: fine-medium thickness, medium density, 2a, oily scalp\n\nShampoo and conditioner: Pantene advanced hairfall solution\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nPerfectil tablet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMultivitamin + minerals supplement for hair, skin and nails\n\nMRP 570 for 30 tablets, available on online pharmacy stores\n\nUsage:\n\nThe tablets are supposed to be taken daily, but I missed few doses and finished the pack in around 5 weeks. Took 1 tablet every day after lunch.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis seems like a good multivitamin and effective IMO. I don't think it's overly pricey, but I'm looking into cheaper yet reliable options like Supradyn. I will consult my doctor first. For the time being, will repurchase this.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nHairgro plus gel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMRP 175 for 50 gm tube of gel, available on online pharmacy stores\n\nKey ingredients:\n\nBiotin 0.001%, D-Panthenol 0.01%, Aloe extract 10%\n\nUsage:\n\nIt looks like blue toothpaste gel and smells like a shaving cream. Imagine adding blue color and perfume to aloe vera gel, this has a very similar consistency. Sinks into my scalp easily, no need to rub in too much. I used it almost daily before bedtime for 2-3 weeks. It didn't make my hair roots greasy at all.\n\nOn the downside, I found it a little difficult to apply evenly on my scalp, while trying to avoid getting it on my hair. I think a thinner gel or liquid would have been much better. Also, I feel like if I use it liberally to cover all my scalp area, I'd run out of the tube (50g) within few days, so I used in moderation. Maybe it is designed to use on bald patches.\n\nVerdict:\n\nWill not repurchase this anytime soon. I am thinking to try their serum which I discovered after buying this gel and it has the same key ingredients.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\nLOreal Professional Xtenso Care Hair Masque\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMPR 685 for 196ml jar, available online (beware of fakes)\n\nUsage:\n\nThis is my most recent purchase among the three, have used it only 4 times till now. The consistency of this masque is much thicker than I expected (like body butter). So far, I have used it on alternate shampoo days. After shampooing, I apply it on slightly damp, towel dry hair. Apply gently on the scalp, along the hair length and leave it for 5 min, then rinse, followed by conditioner and another gentle rinse after some time.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis really works for me, makes my hair look bouncy, healthier and smooth. I skipped using conditioner once, and my hair were still shiny and frizz-free. Noticed less hairfall after use. Will repurchase.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nFor those of you stressed about post-covid hairfall, please remember that telogen effluvium is temporary and reversible, it will stop on its own. I can understand it's easier said than done, but stress can make things worse, so try to be positive. Hope this post was helpful. :)",

    "body": "*Year 1 progress pictures and methods are on r/restoringdick and my profile*\n\nI just completed my first year of restoring and am very pleased with my progress so far. \n\nI started at a fairly tight CI1 and the skin would barely budge while erect. Now I'm at CI3 with around 75% FEC, and first achieved positive FEC at around 6 months. Sensations have improved slightly, but still have a ways to go since I'm not dekeratinized. The skin mobility and gliding motion has greatly improved sex with my wife. I'm a bit large and she's quite tight, so sex used to wear her out and cause pain after awhile, now pain hasn't been an issue for many months. Receiving oral feels significantly better now, as before it did pretty much nothing for me. Masturbation has improved slightly due to skin mobility and gliding, but sensations are still pretty dull until the climax. Orgasms also seem to be more intense for me sometimes.\n\nAs for advice: take progress pictures! Preferrably of flaccid, erect, and FEC (FEC is the most important). Being at CI3 can be very discouraging, and especially if you're a grower and your flaccid size varies throughout the day. So being able to look back a few months and see the progress you've made is a huge motivator (for me at least). Also, remember to take care of your body and skin. I moisturize every night with D-panthenol, and have recently started using silica gel. Also try to get enough protein in your diet (I use shakes: whey, casein, and collagen). Supplements also help IMO, I use Vitamin D, zinc, and fish oil primarily. \n\nAnd finally remember that consistency is key. This process is a marathon, not a sprint. KoT and good luck!",

Healing was pretty much the theme of the haul that time.\nIt arrived about 3-4 weeks ago and I have been trying it ever since.\n\nTexture; It's an opaque white color. Somewhat like a slightly more watery sunscreen or baulm. If anyone has tried LRP cicaplast, the texture is similar. Smooth texture.\n\n5/5 : Smooth and not too thick, or too watery.\n\nApplication; It's pretty easy to apply since it's not very thick. It's smoothness also helps.\n\n5/5 : Easy to apply\n\nFeel on skin; It sinks in fairly well. Feels a tiny bit oily (likely from the sunflower seed oil which is one of top ingredients). But also has this interesting primer-esque like feel. Perhaps from the silicates or b5 since it has 10%\n\n4.5/5 : feels really nice but I HAVE to remove half a star for slight oilyness/and FA triggers. I am a oily gal so anything with too much oils is overwhelming. Tho this is less oily than LRP cicaplast and their riche cream.\n\nEffect; This stuff is not quite HG to me as I am uncertain about it's healing effect. I'm monitoring it for effect. Only issue is I have to use it seperate to my HG Benton centella gel, which means stopping using that for a while.  It is soothing in the least and moisturising.\n\n?4?/5 : 4 just for moistursing and the soothing, primeresque feel\n\nWould potentially repurchase. Especially if I find it increases healing significantly on it's own.\nIn terms of feel and the other stats it does work really nicely with my Benton centella gel. Though it is a nice stand alone in it's own regards and kind of is a better version than 2 LRP products. Imo.",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n❤️Dual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater, PentyleneGlycol, Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica Extract, AloeBarbadensis LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl Olivate,Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract, ZanthoxylumPiperitum Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review 😅\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

    "body": "Hello... Lurking here for a long time, so I felt obligated to post a success story that I thought wouldn't happen. \n\nI was diagnosed with rosacea due to demodex and severely dry cheeks due to Hashimoto after battling red patchy pustuled skin since 2018. I had a lot of stress due to a bad breakup, getting released, finding a new job, moving from town to town, overworking, death of my father, etc so I tried every quick fix solution that the doctors gave me, from corticosteroids (stay away from it), Sudocrem, calendula, calming masks, chamomille, green and black tea bags, tightening creams like Remescar to \"healing\" nappy rash powders that did more damage then help.\n\nAfter the lockdown happened I gathered some money, saw the dermatologist, got the diagnose and went off to do this. First step was killing off the pustules and demodex overload. I got the metronidazole and erythromytsin combo, it did a good job but dried my skin out even more and burned af. Then I got switched to acidi borici that worked much better in every department. At night I used LRP cicaplast for skin repair. But every once in a while the flareup would come back with a vengeance. It got so bad I wouldn't go for a drink with friends, dates, etc. My dermatologist said there are two things she suspects: gut issues or moisture barrier problem and wanted me to go on RoAccutane. I was like hell no, I'm not wrecking my body even more, so I tried out combined over 200 Euros ☹️ worth of moisturizers and creams to see if that will help, without much hope...\n\nIt did.\n\nCouple of weeks ago I had a monthly DM and pharmacy splurge and bought (after failing and getting redder and redder with LRP Rosaliac UV and AR, Bioderma Sensibio AR, Neutrogena Hydroboost, Balea Ultra Sensitive, Aknet, LRP Toleriane, DS Kerium, Alverde, A-Derma, D-panthenol, several oils and pharmacy serums) these four things that had my mother LITERALLY crying when she saw me \"You look the youngest I saw you in 7 years\":\n\nZiaja 0% sensitive face wash - I would get red even from water and any foaming face wash, not from this\n\nMixa Anti Redness 8% moisturizer - I don't know where to start. I put it on. Got slightly redder till it sank in. Then... I went out on wind and -3 temperature, thought I would come back purple. Nothing. This... Worked? Three days later my dry patches were still itching but gone. Now, just a slight tingly feel creeps up sometimes but that's it. Worse \"flareup\" with it was sliiightly pinkish tone after a 45 min run.\n\nMissha Perfect cover BB Cream (not using it anymore but have it as backup) - As I was desperate, I wanted a cover-up, and this was ok for the budget/review level... Accidentaly I fell asleep with it on top of Mixa. Woke up and thought \"Damn, pillows will be skin colored\". No they weren't. Went and washed it off, and... I thought it couldn't wash off cause the face was too clear. After visiting my dermatologist she said it was probably the ceramides in the cream and also zinc in next one...\n\nAvene Cicalfate - last, but not least. Cicaplast worked but wouldn't sink in, so it broke me out sometimes. Cicalfate, on the other hand, is something my skin ate up. That's it, the whole routine, 4 things. Now I can eat spicy or drink a couple of sangrias, (Not too much and not too often, but I do.) Everything is like that corny saying, too good to be true. \n\nI'm a bit paranoid so I had to try out all of the triggers like a madman, I get it, but... I don't know how - but for me, this works... Try it, hope it helps you. If not, maybe smth else will, but just know there is an end to it, and it's not incurable.\n\nP.S. I can put up the \"now\" pictures if needed, but its on \"level unnoticable\"\n\nPhotos added by request, the \"before\" ones, I gotta add are from a relatively calm period, after metronidazole etc, the \"after\" one is taken couple of minutes ago, without anything on the skin https://imgur.com/a/s5EyTrs\n\nP.P.S. Now only the before photo is showing up at the top of the thread, the after one is on the link, so if anyone can help so we can upload both of them directly here, please do! Tnx in advance",

The artisan, Heather Melton is a certified Cosmetic formulator through the Handcrafted Soap and Cosmetic Guild. The artisan’s focus is on nurturing your skin through the use of vitamins and minerals proven in skin health. The Zingari Man line offers shaving soap, post shave, beard care and skin care for a complete grooming experience. Zingari Man products can be sourced direct from their website and also at West Coast Shaving ([https://www.westcoastshaving.com/](https://www.westcoastshaving.com/)).\n\nZingari Man Aftershave balm is available in all of their standard scent offerings. I chose the unscented balm because I can use it directly after my shave as a stand alone or I can use it some time after my application of a scented aftershave splash. This balm is truly scent free, there is no noticeable smell from the ingredients used. This makes it the perfect offering to pair with any scent or fragrance that you want to wear. Try That Soap (https://trythatsoap.com/) recommends Stirling Soap Co. Unscented as a comparable unscented profile.\n\nZingari Man Aftershave balm is very nourishing, as you would expect from a balm. The ingredients list features a skin rich formula of: Water, Witch hazel distillate(alcohol free), Meadowfoam oil,  Glyceryl Stearate (and) PEG 100 Stearate, Jojoba oil, Oat seed oil, Glycerin, Allantion, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl alcohol, d-panthenol, Sorbitol, Fragrance, Propylene Glycol (and) Diazolidinyl Urea (and) Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, White willow extract, Green tea extract, EDTA tetrasodium. Two pumps from the dispenser is enough to cover your entire face. The balm is on the lighter side of consistency, which lends itself to quick absorption. There is a silkiness left on your skin but it is not an oily feeling at all. The protection from this balm last hours upon hours, as it soothes your skin from the harshness inherent in shaving. Given my experience with this post shave, Zingari Man Aftershave balm  receives a PostShaveScore of 90.. For similar performance in post shave, I suggest;  Ariana & Evan/The Club and Maol Grooming.\n\n***Disclosure: All reviews and impressions must state how the product was acquired, whether it be free, sponsored, promotional, purchased, or otherwise.***\n\n* Soap - Stirling Soap Co.

Prior to this, I've only ever used what I thought were proper cleansers.. you know the ones that leave your face feeling like it's going to peel off because of how harsh it is? Okay, I exaggerate, but you get it! So this VAUNT one is super mild, gentle, does not foam, and once I wash my face with it, my skin feels good, oh-so-soft! Doesn't leave my face feeling squeaky-clean and drier than my already dry skin (I'm looking at you The Face Shop's Herb Day 365 Aloe Cleansing Foam). So this was pretty great, considering it was my first time using a gentle face wash and it wasn't a disappointment! It did remove my sunscreen *at times* (I was using Bello Photostable then) but I double cleanse anyway, so it didn't bother me. Same goes for makeup too as I personally double cleanse then as well. As for the amount I used, it was a just a little bit, 2-3 pumps. The pump is not great when it comes to the end of the product, unfortunately (and this is a common complaint I've seen!). I tried getting the product out but couldn't so had to throw the bottle away with that little amount left :/ \n* ***Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status -*** WRP!\n\n\\-\n\nThat's about it! I didn't mention anything about the fragrance because I don't remember :( BUT it felt like it was mostly no fragrance or just a little? Either way I don't usually mind fragrances in my products as I'm not allergic to it. Please feel free to ask me any doubts you have!! I love giving detailed answers AKA I talk a lot and don't shut up ooopss\n\nI've added this to the Megathread as well!!",

There are studies on how it has shown to shorten the days it takes for mitosis.\n\nGenerally you should rinse off whatever was on your dick in the morning anyway but the worst are the ones with oil or petroleum(stay away from aquaphor advanced). \n\nFor cost and availability, cetaphil is good for the average person willing to try it. Its cheap and contains Panthenol with ither things that heal your skin and make it feel smooth.  \n\nPalmers Coco butter, the Shea Butter, vitamin E are make you skin feel good but do little on the cellular level down deep. Plus they are oily!\n\nOn the costlier side of the spectrum are the $15-40 ones: \n\nBepanthen Plus: works good , \n\nRenu28 (doesn’t contain Panthenol but makers claim it also speeds up mitosis. Concoction of different salt bases which probably help retain moisture that you are losing, also makes skin feel very soft), \n\nPanthenol v-shield: out of Korea, simple formula that has a high 15% Panthenol and works nice.  A favorite. \n\nRetinol Beauty Spa: has pretty much Retinol and Panthenol. Works good but costly for a very small amount.\n\nD-Panthenol: out of Greece, seems to work good but I’m not convinced the product is high quality. The one I have seems there is some separation that has gone on.\n\n\nAny other suggestions I’m willing to try it. :)",

I wanted softer hair that I would need to wash less. After deciding that I would go nopoo, I went a week with no washing and it looked pretty horrible although washing and scrubbing with water helped some. I was going to use baking soda and acv at the end of the week, but I learned about the pH of baking soda and didnt want to dry out my scalp or risk it getting onto my face. I bought Shea Moisture Retention Shampoo at Walgreens for ten dollars. This stuff was amazing! My hair wasnt devoid of oil and it didnt do the backlash of intense oil afterward. It just helped to remove some grit and moisturized my scalp. The second week I did only water again and it took around 3 or four days to start showing grease. Im on week three now with water only and washing with the \"shampoo\" and acv once a week.  Here are the ingredients:\n\nDeionized Water , Decyl Glucoside (Sugar Beets) , African Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter) , Aloe Vera Leaf Juice , Argan Oil , Panthenol (Provitamin B5) , Rosemary Extract , Sea Kelp Extract , Vitamin E , Lonicera Caprifolium Flower Extract (Honeysuckle) , Lonicera Japonica Flower Extract (Japanese Honeysuckle) \n\nMy hair has never felt better. My waves are pronounced and soft. I will continue to wash once a week until my hair finishes transitioning and Ill update later on. Ill also be trying honey masks soon.\n This shampoo is easily a DIY as well if you don't want to buy it. The ingredients could all be bought in bulk for cheap\n\n\nJust wanted to provide another story for people looking for different options!",

If products too heavy, face goes red.\n\nHad severe acne in 2014-2017. Was on doxy for 2 years. Worked while on it, but suffered nerve damage called Parsonage Turner Syndrome from it. Still get acne though.\n\nI’ve listed below products I’ve used from 2014 to mid 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProactiv three step – I only use the face wash BP and toner Glycolic. Currently skin doesn’t like. But a staple from 2003-2014. Occasional use in 2019/2020.\n\nLa roche  posay lipikar baume - wtf smells soo bad\n\nLa roche posay effaclar starter kit - Very drying, painful and reddening\n\nLa roche posay toleriane dermo cleanser - burning and heat\n\nSimple kind to skin purifying cleansing lotion - pore clogging. Sister loved it though\n\nLacura Face Care Hydrating Facial Cleanser with Provitamin B5 - Fragranced and burning. But used two bottles.\n\nNew Directions Mild Cleansing Cream - Made skin around nose heat up\n\nPaula’s Choice Redness Relief Toner for Normal to Oily Skin – Face swelled up, more pinkness and a rash or acne?\n\nEgo qv face revitalising eye cream - nice but milia (however I have used many packs)\n\nEgo qv face nuturing night cream - very greasy. But been a long time. Might try it again\n\nEgo qv face day cream spf 30 - Possibly the reason I got acne in 2014. I think it was oily too. (used 2 packs)\n\nQv gentle face wash - Pore clogging. Used up on body during a dry dry winter.\n\nGarden of Wisdom Azeliac Acid 10% - Very grainy. Spreading it was very painful. It stings. (Much prefer Finecea Gel 15%, no pain there)\n\nHaba Labo Milk Lotion – Did nothing..or is that good?\n\nThe Ordinary Niacinamide + Zinc: I looked sunburnt whenever I tried this. Though never got pilling like lots have complained about\n\nThe Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors: Just wasn’t moisturising enough\n\nThe Ordinary 100% L-Ascorbic Acid Powder: Pink face if used more than twice a week and didn’t seem to help dark spots. Expired before finished it\n\nThe Ordinary Copper Peptides + buffet: Didn’t do anything, might of irritated the skin around mouth/nose. Went through 1 bottle.\n\nThe Ordinary Caffeine Solution: Around eyes became very very dry. Only used twice.\n\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid + B5: Pilled when I added moisturiser on top. After a week I stopped trying.\n\nThe Ordinary Squalane Oil: Face went red and after a few days got bumps? on my forehead. Used whole bottle though.\n\nBiossance Squalane Oil: Face went red even faster and the same bumps returns\n\nHaba Labo Plumbing Gel: Stinging skin around nose and making it very red.\n\nNeutrogena Ultra Sheer Face Lotion SPF 30+: I have never tried a more painful product in my life. Missed a day of work to ice my face. The zinc version is a-okay though. And they fully refunded the cost.\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Eye Roll On – the fragrance burns. Not moisturising at all\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Sleeping Mask – Actually not bad, but the small packet is inconvenient and wasteful. Plus soo hard to open (and not sure if it’s hygienic as can’t close it again)\n\nClear Skin Clinic B3 10% serum: Again red face. They had a 5% one that was okay but they said they didn’t sell it anymore. Was drying but probably because of the denat alcohol (second ingredient after water)\n\nClear Skin Clinics Copper Peptite Serum - Didn't notice any difference after using a bottle so stopped\n\nClear Skin Clinics BB Red Cover - Nice but expensive.\n\nPrimera Gentle Hydrating Cream – Nice but hard to get/expensive and the pump broke lol\n\nStridex (red box) – Very drying and didn’t do anything for acne\n\nClay masks (Sand&Sky Pink, Sukin Super Greens, Proactiv Sulfer, Mario Badicuso Sulfer, New directions dead sea mud mask) – drying and did nothing for acne. Maybe made things more inflamed.\n\nTrilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil – Pink skin and bumps\n\nNew Directions Tamanu Oil – So greasy and not moisturising. \n\nAfrican black soap – drying did nothing for acne (might of made it worse)\n\nJojoba oil – Soooo greasy and not moisturising\n\nRose water (Heritage Store & New Directions & one from grocery store) – Burning and redness\n\nHoney anything – I think I’m allergic. Natural honey on face itches like crazy.\n\nBenton Snail Bee Essence – Itchiness and redness (I was dumb and didn’t realise I’m probably allergic)\n\nThayers Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera, Cucumber – Pinky face and also not sure what it’s supposed to do\n\nTea Tree – burning, blisters. Red eyes. This was from one drop into my cleansing oil. \n\nSkinstitut Gentle Cleanser – A whole tube before I realised this was drying my skin. Did enjoy it though.\n\nSkinstitut L-Lactic Cleanser - Very drying. Gave away\n\nSkinistitut Glycolic Cleanser 12% (and 14% scrub) - Can't believe I used these two on my face. However fantastic on my body.\n\nSkinistitut Enzymatic Micro Peel - Pretty sure it did nothing. Used the whole tube. Expensive and tiny.\n\nSkinstitut - Moisture Defense (tried normal, oily & dry) Nice but so little product and soo expensive\n\nSul first activating serum – Face went red. Not sure but maybe this is the glow everyone was talking about. Except I am trying to avoid a red face lol\n\nLaser Hair Removal – two years every six weeks. Only thinned it out :/\n\nLanierge water sleeping mask – For a change it’s not the scent, it just doesn’t ‘seal’ anything in or moisturise.. The lip mask isn’t too bad though.\n\nEtude House Soonjung Sleeping Pack – Doesn’t ‘seal’ anything in or moisturise.\n\nMad Hippie Vit C – Three bottles later and I have to conclude it didn’t bring any glow or do anything. My skin has suffered no loss from it’s removal.\n\nAndalou vit c serum - Very thick and irritating\n\nVanessa Megan's Collagen Gel Serum (gota kola, aloe, centella) – two bottles later and I realise its causing tiny under the skin pimples. Dunno what ingredient could cause it though.\n\nBlue and red light treatments at home & derms office – I felt this was a waste of money, no improvements what so ever\n\nTime Revolution TFM – Tiny Under the skin acne/pimples\n\nAzclear Action – Pills like crazy. Nothing can go over it. Pretty sure it did nothing because it pilled off everytime I used it\n\nPre-cleansers – Miceller waters from bioderma and Garnier. Very painful..though maybe the cotton rounds. Doesn’t clean very well.\n\nOil cleansers – Shu – uemura good but expensive, Chinoshio – good but expensive, Simple – HG but Im pregnant atm. The body shop chamomile – wtf leaks everywhere\n\nVarious sunscreens – Skinstitut spf50+ zinc, Nivea kids spf 50+, Cerave AM spf 30, Cerave Ultralight spf 30, Ego Sensitive Zinc spf 50+, Neutrogena zinc, Invisible zinc junior spf50+. Natio Moisturising face spf 50+, Ego Azclear Moisturing spf 30+  Many of these I repurchased many times.\n\nI'm sorry this is soo long\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited: because tweaked my routine slightly, turns out going red after putting on Cerave is a bad thing. Don't have that reaction with Zeroid. Maybe I have rosacea, after thinking about all the things that make my face heat up and go red..",

    "body": "(edited as I forgot about the citric acid)\n\nI've been making this gel for a few months, it performs a lot like flaxseed gel but is much easier to make.  I modify based on the weather and the state of my hair, but the whole preservative thing makes me a little paranoid. I'm using Germaben II at 1% and I add it either after I put in the water or in the finished product. I'm a little nervous as my recipe has oil but it only 1 to 3% depending on how moisturizing a product I want to make. Here is my recipe:\n\n* Distilled Water to 100%\n* 2% Xanthan Gum (this makes a thick gel, if you like thinner gel use 1.5 or 1%)\n* 1% D-Panthenol Liquid (optional but adds conditioning)\n* .5% Aloe 100x powder or substitute half of your water with edible aloe vera gel (optional if your hair doesn't like aloe) \n* 1%-3% Vegetable Glycerin (optional, avoid in high or low dew points)\n* 2% Grapeseed Oil (you can sub in your favorite oil here, I like Grapeseed because its light and absorbs well, also depending on you hair dryness and thickness you can add less or more oil but I wouldn't go more than 3%. The oil is what makes it act like flaxseed gel as flaxseed has natural oils)\n* Enough citric acid to get pH between 4-5. (I last used about .25g for 300g of gel). Keeping the gel a little acid helps with frizz and shine.\n\n*   1% Germaben II \n\nDirections. \n\n1. In your mixing beaker or cup, Mix the oil, panthenol and glycerin with the xanthan gum and the aloe powder (if using ) until you form a paste. This will ease the mixing in of water.\n\n2. Add in your distilled water.\n\n3. Mix with a stick blender.\n\n4. Add your preservative.  Mix again.\n\n5. Add in citric acid very slowly to get to pH\n\n6. Bottle and enjoy! Use about as much product as you would a light to medium hold gel but more than you would a hard hold gel. I use a couple tablespoons for my hair that is a couple inches past my armpit.",

And do you find the citric acid is necessary? If so, what ph should it be specifically for hair use? I keep finding conflicting information for scalp ph vs hair ph. Can we use anything other than citric acid to level out the ph? I assume something like lemon juice or acv aren't shelf stable enough to use?",

In the meantime, let's start the weekend with another addition to our growing Skincare Guide, last week was about treating [dark spots and hyperpigmentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blackskincare/comments/1ftgjq0/skincare%5C_guide%5C_dark%5C_spots%5C_and%5C_hyperpigmation/?utm%5C_source=share&utm%5C_medium=web3x&utm%5C_name=web3xcss&utm%5C_term=1&utm%5C_content=share%5C_button). This week's all about helping you build your routine, so you can live your best skin life!\n\nPlease share any feedback, and comment below.\n  \n*As always, please report any bullying or inappropriate comments, that's not the energy we want in our sub.*\n\n--Nat\n\n-----------------\n\n#🛠️Building Your Foundation\n\nThe foundation of all happy and healthy skin (outside of diet) is a solid routine. Whether you wish to treat texture, acne, or fine lines; building a skincare routine involves focusing on hydration, moderation, proper cleansing, and protection.\n\n This is a basic routine guide that can be adjusted based on your skin type and budget. The foundation of any routine consists of a cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen at its core. We aren’t thinking about treatment for skin issues just yet, this is for basic hygiene maintenance. Default to this if experiencing reactions or a compromised skin barrier. Omit all harsh products, no actives, no scrubs, or peels. Sometimes you might even need to skip sunscreen depending on how irritated your skin is.\n\n**Core routine = Cleanser, moisturize, and sunscreen**\n\n*This contains no actives as I want the focus to be on a gentle and barrier-friendly approach. You'll be using this daily, so we mustn't have any products that aren't okay for daily usage and can dry out the skin, adding more to your plate. Less is more.*\n\n#Understand Your Skin Type\n\n*First, identify your skin type (dry, oily, combination, normal, or sensitive).*\n\n- **Oily Skin:** Characterized by a higher-than-average production of sebum, skin’s natural oil. This excess oiliness can make the skin appear shiny or greasy and is often accompanied by skin concerns like blackheads and enlarged pores. As clogged pores are a major contributor to breakouts, those with oily skin may also be prone to breakouts. Requires lightweight hydration and oil control, and can be dehydrated.\n\n- **Dry Skin:** The opposite of oily skin—it’s skin that doesn’t have *enough* oil. It may look dull or feel tight, while severe dryness can cause the skin to crack, flake, or peel. Dry skin and dehydrated skin are sometimes used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing—dehydration is a lack of water, and that can happen to anyone, regardless of skin type. Needs rich or layered hydration and moisture retention.\n\n- **Combination Skin:** Displays two or more defining characteristics—like dryness and oiliness—in different areas. Oftentimes, people with combination skin will have an oilier T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin), while their cheeks will be drier. Needs balancing products, and hydrating dry areas without making oily areas greasier.\n\n- **Sensitive Skin:** Characterized by a heightened sensitivity to stressors, including some skincare products. Degrees of sensitivity can vary: Some people only experience mild irritation when exposed to stressors, while others struggle with redness, itching, and discomfort regularly. That being said, sensitivity isn’t always visible—sometimes, it’s just about how the skin feels. Needs gentle, non-irritating products. No to low fragrances/essential oils (though this should be applied to all skin types).\n\n\n\n\n#🛢️Step 0: Oil Cleansing or Micellar Water\n\n*Why should you use either? What are the benefits?*  \nIt can be hard to wash off sunscreen, especially water-resistant ones, or makeup with just your cleanser, the process will eat up the product, likely irritate your skin, or you’ll be left with residue that’ll cause breakouts. Using either an oil cleanser or micellar water makes the process effortless and effective. Moreover, specifically in the case of oil cleansing, it can help loosen clogged pores, so blackheads can be removed and sebaceous filaments (*found on places like your nose and chin*) can be reduced. Remember to always follow up with your second cleanser!\n\n❌ **Did you know not all oil cleansers are oil cleansers?** ❌  \n*As crazy as that sounds some “oil cleansers” are just gentle cleansers that are formulated to look like oil and have the texture of an oil cleanser. CeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser isn’t an oil cleanser, it’s a cleanser. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ Gentle Foaming Cleansing Oil, yup, not an oil cleanser too! So, how do you tell, look at the ingredient list if it says water you have your answer. A true oil cleanser contains no water.*  \n   \n**Pro tips:** Always apply to dry skin. If skin is congested, massage with an oil for a few minutes and follow up with a BHA or AHA cleanser.\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Unrefined and Cold-Pressed Jojoba Oil**\n\n**Dermalogica Precleanse Oil Cleanser** (though I wish it was made without the essential oils)\n\n**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil**\n\n**Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Radiance Cleansing Balm**\n\n**Naturium Purple Ginseng Cleansing Balm**\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Makeup Remover Cleansing Balm** (no fragrance)\n\n**e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm**\n\n**CeraVe Micellar Water Facial Cleanser**\n\n**Bioderma Hydrabio (dry skin) or Sensibio (sensitive) H2O Micellar Water**( my personal favorites)\n\n\n\n\n#🫧Step 1: Cleanser\n\n**Purpose:** Cleansing removes dirt, oil, and impurities.\n\n**What to look for:** Sulfate-free products with ingredients like **Glycerin** or **Ceramides** or **Panthenol** or **Niacinamide** or **Allantoin** or **Colloidal Oatmeal** to name a few.\n\n**Types**: Cream, low to no foaming cleansers for dry skin, normal, and sensitive skin. Gel or foaming cleansers for oily/combination and normal skin. All skin types can benefit from a non-foaming cleanser, I highly recommend Jelly Joker by Geek and Gorgeous.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, creamy version**\n\n~~**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**~~\n\n**Geek and Gorgeous Jelly Joker (doesn’t foam)**\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Low pH Rice Bar**\n\n**Aveeno Positively Radiant Brightening Cleanser**\n\n**Cosrx Advanced Snail Mucin Gel Cleanser**\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash** (might cause irritation)\n\n**La Roche-Posay Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n**La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP + Gentle Foaming Moisturizing Wash**\n\n**Good Molecules Hydrating Facial Cleansing Gel**\n\n**Good Molecules Hydrate and Cleanse Bar** \n\n#💧Step 2: Toner (Optional)\n\n**Purpose:** Can be used to help balance the skin’s pH, add a layer of hydration, prep the skin for following serums and treatments, or as a treatment.\n\n**Types:** You have a liquid that ranges from water consistency to a creamier watery consistency like clam chowder. Or toner pads that double as exfoliation, physical and chemical (if it contains actives).\n\n**What to look for:** Choose toners with good fatty alcohols like, **Lauryl, Myristyl, Cetyl, and Stearyl**. Hydrating or soothing ingredients, like **Glycerin**, **Ceramides**, **Panthenol**, **Niacinamide**,**Rose Water**, **Green Tea**, or **Hyaluronic Acid**.\n\n⚠️Be on the lookout for harsh toners with drying alcohols, like **SD alcohol**, **Ethanol**,  **Ethyl**, **Isopropyl**, and **methanol** alcohol (hand sanitizer), which can irritate and dry out the skin.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n*These are only gentle toners, no actives*\n\n **Paulas Choice Advanced Replenishing Toner**\n\n**Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner**\n\n**Etude House Soonjung pH5.5 Toner**\n\n**Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner**\n\n**Dermalogica Ultra-Calming Toner**\n\n**Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus**\n\n**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Toner**\n\n**Heritage Store Rosewater & Glycerin Hydrating Facial Mist**\n\n\n#🧪Step 3: Serum/Ampoules\n*no actives*\n\n*This part of your routine should be used to soothe, hydrate, and nourish your skin either before you use your actives or after, depending on the product type. A strong healthy skin barrier means less chance of breakouts and irritation.*\n\n**Purpose:** Serums target specific concerns like dryness, hyperpigmentation, dullness, or uneven texture. They can be lightweight, creamy, water-based, or oil-based.\n\n**What to look for:** Soothing, hydrating calming ingredients. Just like what was suggested previously. **Glycerin**, **Ceramides**, **Panthenol**, **Niacinamide**, **Green Tea**, or **Hyaluronic Acid**.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Good Molecules Niacinamide serum**\n\n**Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Serum**\n\n**Cosrx Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule**\n\n**Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule**\n\n**The Ordinary Multi-Peptide + HA Serum**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 5% Face and Body Emulsion**\n\n**The Ordinary Amino Acids + B5**\n\n\n\n#🧴Step 4: Moisturizer\n\n**Purpose:** *Moisturizers lock in hydration and protect the skin barrier.*\n\n**Pro tip:** Opt for a *rich moisturizer* and layered hydration for dry skin. For oily skin, gel-based moisturizers with non-comedogenic ingredients work well to avoid clogging pores and avoid over cleansing. \n\n**Key ingredients include:**\n\n**Colloidal Oatmeal:** Soothing and anti-inflammatory properties can help treat redness and inflammation.  \n\n- **Ceramides:** Help restore and improve the skin's barrier to lock in moisture and prevent dryness. \n\n- **Squalane:** Helps increase hydration and has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n- **Panthenol:** A provitamin B5 derivative, is recognized for its moisturizing, soothing, and skin barrier‐enhancing properties, \n\n- **Niacinamide:** Barrier supporting, sebum regulator, helps with dark spots and evening out skin tone.\n\n- **Hyaluronic acid:** For hydration and plumping the skin.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Aveeno Calm + Restore  Oat Gel Moisturizer**\n\n**Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra-Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n**Neutrogena Fragrance-free Daily Moisturizer**\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizer**\n\n**CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel Moisturizer**\n\n**Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Moisturizer**\n\n**Vanicream Daily Moisturizer** \n\n**Olay Regenerist  Regenerating Serum Moisturizer**\n\n\n#☀️Step 5: Sunscreen\n\n - **Purpose:** Sunscreen protects against UV rays, prevents hyperpigmentation, and protects and maintains your results.\n\n\n##Recommended Products:\n\n**Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 or 50** This one has a little bit of a white cast, nothing crazy, hydrating, and consistency like lotion.\n\n**Kiehl’s Better Screen UV Serum** has zero white cast, but it isn’t water resistant. Hydrating but not heavy, combo or dry.\n\n**Neutrogena Invisible Daily Defense** no white cast, hydrating, some might not like the bit of shine from it but I fix that with powder. Thin consistency.\n\n**Elta MD UV Clear Face Sunscreen SPF 46** Very lightweight, no white cast.\n\n**Supergoop Mineral Matte**, thick and white cast heavy but good for under makeup. No water resistance.\n\n**Supergoop Unseen**, no white cast, feels like a silicone makeup primer, wanted to love this but it made me so greasy and clogged. Water resistant. Thick.\n\n**Supergoop Every. Single. Face Watery Lotion**, some shine but nothing crazy that powder didn’t fix. Water resistant. Thin consistency.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotics**, no water resistance, feels like a moisturizer. Thin-ish consistency.\n\n**Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun Aqua-Fresh Rice + B5** Seems to be more favorable towards oily skin than the original version.\n\n**Innisfree Daily UV Defense** No water resistance, can double as a moisturizer in some cases. Probably best for dry skin.\n\n#🎯End Result🎯\n\nSo, with your core routine in mind, things should be like this: oil cleanser or micellar water, a cleanser, toner (optional), serum for soothing/hydration (*optional, you can just cleanse and then moisturize on days you rest from actives*), treatment product, moisturizer, sunscreen. These items make up your routine, then you sort into day and night. Be sure to balance between rest days and active days depending on your skin needs and your level of skincare experience.\n\n*Note your treatment product could be in the form of a **serum** (think Good Molecules Niacinamide or The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% Serum) or **toner** (think Paulas Choice 2% BHA) or even **cleanser** (think Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid face wash) or a mask.*\n\n\n#Treating Specific Concerns\n\n *Depending on your skin concerns, add specific treatments to your routine:*\n\n\n##Hyperpigmentation/Dark Spots\n\n   - Ingredients: **Vitamin C**, **niacinamide**, **azelaic acid**, **retinol**.\n\n   - Use treatments with these ingredients in your serum or spot treatments to fade dark spots and even out skin tone.\n\n\n##Acne\n\n   - Ingredients:**Salicylic Acid**, **Mandelic Acid**, **Sulfur**, **Benzoyl Peroxide**, **Retinol**.\n\n\n##Dryness\n\n   - Focus on hydration by layering with products containing **hyaluronic acid**, **glycerin**, **collagen**, **shea butter**, or **cocoa butter**.\n\n\n##Texture Issues\n\n   - Ingredients: **AHAs** (like glycolic or lactic acid) for exfoliation and texture improvement.\n\n   - Chemical exfoliation 2-3 times a week helps to keep skin smooth and radiant.\n\n\n##Exfoliation \n(*1-2 times a week, or more depending on your skincare level*)\n\n   -**Purpose:** Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, improve texture, and keep the skin smooth.\n\n   - Opt for gentle chemical exfoliants like **lactic acid** or **mandelic acid** to avoid irritation, as physical scrubs can be too harsh and cause micro-tears in the skin.\n\n\n#Lifestyle Factors\n\n**Diet and Hydration:** Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and vitamins to support healthy skin from within. Take supplements if you need to. \n\n**Sleep:** Ensure enough sleep to allow your skin to regenerate overnight.\n\n\n#Consistency is Key\n\n*Stick to your routine consistently for a few months to see results. Now isn’t a time to be a product hoe and jump from trend to trend, be loyal to the products as long as they aren’t causing adverse reactions.*\n\n#Additional Considerations:\n\n**Patch Test**: Always patch-test new products to avoid potential irritation.\n\n**Avoid Over-Exfoliation**: Too much exfoliation can irritate and worsen skin issues.",

The mask is quite transparent, so if you have acne or redness you should be able to see it underneath \n\nI will now type out the ingredients \n\nWater, Glycosy Trehalsoe/Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate (Trehalose), Xanthan gum, MethylParaben, Phenoxyethanol, Tranexamic Acd, D-Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Alpha-Arbutin, Allantoin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid, Frangrance (HAHA OATMEAL FRAGRANCE). \n\nSo. as we can see here This IS SOME PRETTY cheap stuff. \nI believe it's around $10 usd or 300 if you're in Taiwan. So would I buy this? NO haha my mom buys this for me and I am 100% appreciative. I think it's most effective for anyone who's skin is mildy oil with a few pimples at times. IF YOU have a bit of extreme acne (borderline cystic or pretty much cystic ;A;) it doesn't break me out. \n2/5 I use this when I run out of my vitamin c stuff (dr wu or dewytree) \n\nThank you for reading ;A; ",

I am in the market for a new cream as I am running out of my current one (Cosrx's Aloe Oil Free Moisturizing cream) and I need a thicker and more moisturizing cream for the winter. For reference, I have super dry, dehydrated, sensitive and acne prone skin. My skin cannot tolerate alcohol and essential oils and I want to find a cream that is soothing but also mega moisturizing because my face is hECKING DRY right now (Canadian winters are ROUGH). Has anyone tried any of these two creams by Cosrx and would you recommend them to someone with my skin type/concerns? (I know the B5 D-panthenol cream is new so maybe no one has tried it yet to make a detailed review but any thoughts are appreciated). Or if you have another recommendation besides these creams feel free to mention them as well :).",

My hands will actually curl up in my sleep because my skin is so dry it's uncomfortable to open my hand fully. I've always had trouble finding a hand lotion that will provide lasting relief.

I love the idea of a daily moisturizer that doubles as an SPF.\n\nAnd, the City Sunscreen claimed to be an idea fit for someone who wants lightweight SPF (perfect for combination/oily skin).\n\nOne paper and initial application(s) both products did incredibly well. Depending on which one you look at...featured ingredients include Safflower Extracts and synthetic moisturizers/emollients that help lock in hydration.\n\nBoth have fairly lightweight and approachable textures/feels. But, the Superscreen goes on with a bit more “weight” and just felt more nourishing/emollient throughout the day.\n\nAlso, each product shares the benefit of absorbing really well and not feeling sticky/greasy which is a totally plus for a face sunscreen.\n\nThe Superscreen has a slight scent of fresh cut flowers/powder that dissipates over time while the City Sunscreen didn't really have any scent to speak of that I could detect.\n\nHaving said all of that...the biggest thing that these Supergoop! products shared (at least in my experience) is that they caused some significant breakout along my forehead, cheeks, and temples. \n\nI was so bummed to see this result and even removed them from my routine...let things calm down...and reintroduce them over the course of a couple of weeks to make sure they were the culprits. Unfortunately, the issues with blemishes came back.\n\nI’ve pointed at essential oils/fragrance as the reason why the skin on my face just doesn't respond well to some Supergoop! Products...but neither of these have an exorbitant amount of those ingredients (if any).  \n\nAt this point I have resigned myself to knowing that me and my face just don’t get along with the majority of Supergoop! products. I still have the Glow Screen, Glow Stick, 100% Mineral Sunscreen Stick, and a round two with the Unseen Sunscreen to get to...and I’m crossing my fingers I have some luck there.\n\nOtherwise, Supergoop! just seems like a body-only brand for me LOL! I’ll be finishing up the rest of these two products on my arms and legs. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nSupergoop!

I had barrier break out because of tret but after using dexpanthenol, I no longer have break outs. Like none at all!! Snail essense is great for acne scar and overall brightening (fresh scar spots).\n\nI don't know if you can buy brand 2sol from overseas, but if you can, I recommend activator barrier cream 100g ($13 in Korea). I used this for 10 years and this cream makes your foundation apply better and it's THE perfect cream. I use it in humid hot summer, and dry cold winter.\n\nI also use 2sol Hint LHA toner ($10) for my body acne and hair dandruff, niacin 10% treatment 100ml ($8) on no tret day.",

Since elementary school I can remember pulling what little skin I had over my head and trying to keep it there with various methods, including scotch tape (lol). That was before I even knew what foreskin was, something in me just felt like it was missing. In my teens/early adult years I realized I preferred the penis uncircumcised. I remember seeing an uncircumcised friend of mine naked in high school and I was incredibly jealous with how his penis looked compared to mine. That’s when I started researching various methods to restore circumcised foreskin. I purchased a TLC-X in college (2015ish) with randomly guessed dimensions because I didn’t have a tape measure at the time. I didn’t wear it often, and eventually I gave up because it didn’t fit right. Fast forward to 2020, I decided it was time to give it another go. I work from home now so I have nothing but time. I purchased a seamstress tape-measure and got the correct dimensions this time. My new TLC-X arrived just before the New Year. \n\nConcerns:\n\nI found this Reddit only a few days ago and have been browsing through it. I purchased only a TLC-X hoping it would get the job done, however, I’ve seen people combining all sorts of methods. I’m really trying to keep it simple and not have to add several methods and devices to juggle with. \n\nI also found out about something called keratinizing… does this happen to everyone? Will I need to get some sort of cream to combat the keratin?\n\nThe burning/pinching sensation: I’ve been wearing my TLC-X for 4 hours a day starting this week. It seems as soon as hour 2 rolls around, I start to get the burning/pinching sensation. Also, the Your Skin cone seems to get stuck on my skin and feels like a pinch to peel it off. I ended up purchasing a lotion I saw recommended on here called “La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5” with Shea Butter and D-Panthenol hoping to combat this sensation. \n\nI’ve read that I should be able to wear the TLC-X for 12-14 hours eventually. As of now, I’m still adjusting to wearing it and working out the kinks. \n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m curious, how many people here have used only the TLC-X without any other methods? How long did it take for you to achieve full coverage?\n\nAny dialogue, tips, and tricks are welcome!!",

What you will find however, is there is a difference between inflation devices and the dual tension devices like the TLC -X.  Inflation usually targets inner skin whereas the dual tension devices allow you to contemporaneously tug both inner and outer skin.  I am typing this on my desktop but I have some information about inner and outer skin on my phone which I will post separately.\n\n\" I’ve been wearing my TLC-X for 4 hours a day starting this week.

Skin grows with constant tension, gentle to moderate not massive, over a long time period.  u/lcburgandy has good posts about the time needed to achieve results using a tugger.  I'll post those separately too.\n\nI suggest you have a read of the getting started guide which you will find in the menu tab here.\n\nAlthough I am only using Andre's method at present, I did for sometime during 2019 and into early 2020 use only the TLC X on dual tension and achieved very good skin growth.  \n\nIf you can get you routine adjusted to 12+ hours a day in the tugger and be consistent every day (as per lcburgandy's post) you should manage between 1 to 3mm of skin growth a month.",

    "body": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm 24 years old and I apologize in advance for the block of text. I made a post about a couple weeks ago of a sustained injury that I had using Andre’s Method on the scar line, which happened on the 9th of March. The consensus from those I had spoken to in DMs and in my last post was that I’ve excited a nerve and overstretched the skin, maybe even ‘spraining’ the skin. It’s an odd injury as I don’t believe the skin looks too different (if at all), had no bleeding or bruising, and absolutely no numbing (I clarify this now as at the time I was unsure). Skin has full sensation whenever touched and I haven’t ever had any residual pain since then. It would seem so normal. However on the affected area where I tugged a little too hard, the area has been sensitive and mildly stings whenever touched, along with feeling slightly overstretched whenever gently tugged. At first walking and sleeping were uncomfortable, but now I don’t feel any stinging whenever walking or shifting in sleep. Sometimes whenever I’m sitting down and my junk shifts, I do feel a sting. The stinging is odd and is reminiscent of very mildly overtugging in the past, as the sensation oddly spreads to my very upper thigh for a brief moment. Whenever I masturbate, I don’t notice the affected area at all from jerking or even rubbing it, and there’s been no change in sensation. Just seems that I only feel it whilst flaccid. From what I believed, each day seemed slightly better than the last.\n\nYesterday, something else happened. I remember at the beginning of the day very gently touching (applying no pressure to) the affected area for several seconds and my junk started to burn for about an hour or so. The burning sensation felt like it transferred all around my genitals. I’m not exactly sure what happened, but the affected area became more sensitive again right up to bedtime, but I think it's gotten better. I do remember preparing some food with hot sauce, but I’m not entirely sure if it got on my fingers or not. I’m guessing it did because it made no sense why else that event would have arbitrarily happened, and the sensation slowly rescinded after washing. I’m sadly quite accident prone for some reason, and I swear I don’t intentionally apply a lot of tugging tension or hurt myself purposefully. I'm just dumb.\n\nRegardless, it’s been almost two weeks while using a red light and D-Panthenol daily, and this injury still hasn’t fully healed. I don’t feel comfortable tugging at the moment, despite desperately and anxiously wanting to get back into the grind. I made it from RCI-1 to almost RCI-3 before this happened, so it's frustrating for me. I briefly attempted some very light tugs about a week after the injury, and the area was still slightly stinging and the skin still felt overstretched. In all, I didn’t feel comfortable doing it, so I stopped after about a minute or so of experimentation. Does anyone know when things will return to normal and if there's anything else I should do? This is very frustrating and it really makes me nervous. I’m really scared that something terrible has happened, and sleeping has been difficult. I’m not used to being hurt.\n\nDespite understanding there’s likely not much they can do, I’m going to see my really good doctor here in a few weeks and get some additional advice, while continuing to abstain from tugging until the stinging goes away.\n\nI again apologize for the long text. I really want to get back into the grind!",

It takes a lot of mental fortitude to remain calm and positive, but that is what I think you must do.\n\nIt sounds like when you left it alone for a while, it started to get noticeably better. To me, that means it will likely heal completely. You probably just need to give it more time. How much, I have no idea. Give it another two weeks. Give it a month if you have to. Of course, we all want to be finished restoring yesterday, but in the grand scheme of the years that it takes, one month isn't actually a huge deal. The body has a remarkable ability to heal. Let it do its thing. \n\nTrust me, if I were in your shoes, I know I'd have a really hard time not actively restoring. However, if you exacerbate this injury, you're only gonna set yourself back even further and lose even more time. The path that leads to the least regret is the one in which you wait patiently for your injury to get better.\n\nTry not to overwhelm yourself with overly negative thoughts about it, you'll just drive yourself crazy with that crap. This was your body teaching you a hard limit. Give it time to recuperate fully (which it *will* do, believe it!) and then you'll be back on track, and you'll know just how hard you can tug there. Remember that moderate tension is your friend.\n\nGood luck, I'm rootin for ya dude. I think you're going to be fine. Your biggest challenge right now is probably resisting restoring long enough for your body to do what it needs to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nSrsly, make sure you give it enough time. Don't turn a one-month injury into a three-month one. You'll be really goddamn mad at yourself for that. Focus your attention on the long-term goals of restoring and stay positive :)",

Just wanted to share information for anyone else who might be looking.\n\nI’m in the old city (sultanahmet) part of Istanbul:\n\nPharmacies are called: Eczane and are marked with a red ‘E’ outside shops. \n\nFinasteride - 1mg box of 28 tablets are currently about 800 Turkish lira. A 5mg box of 28 tablets is considerably cheaper at about 150 lira for the Proscar brand. I’ve bought the 5mg and going to cut the tablets so it’s a smaller dose. No prescription needed for either. \n\nOral minoxidil: not available anywhere. They are saying it’s not available in Turkey.\n\nHope that helps and if anyone else does know where to get the oral minoxodil please let us all know!\n\nEdit 24/08/2024:\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nHi folks, as promised here is a quick update. \nSo following the recommendation by u/Far-Yogurt-8590 I did eventually find oral minoxidil capsules (not tablets) that you can buy without a prescription at Cerrahpaşa nur eczanesi. \nI made contact with the pharmacy via whatsapp (late evening) and was sent the below message by the pharmacy in Turkish. I have provided the original messages below with their price list below.\nIt seems that most of the products for hair loss are off-label and made by the lead pharmacist (who I believe is called Ms. Ayşe?) on-site in her basement lab which she was keen to show us. It's a clean environment where she 'compounds' medicines to create different products for various conditions.  They did however have official PROSCAR Finasteride, etc.\nOn the day I visited there were 4 other pharmacists/assistants so it's not like she's working in silo. Their pharmacy is on a main round close to other pharmacies and I think there's a hospital nearby.  The pharmacist is very transparent proud to share that she is a 3rd generation pharmacist and that she is registered as a pharmacist in the USA and has lived there for a while. She speaks very good English I don't doubt for a moment that she's bullshitting about that.\nWe had a very good lengthy chat about hair loss.

I've heard many of you ask for something more organic/pure/clean etc since there are some things such as a little fragrance or preservatives in the other one that can be irritating.\n\nI've personally tried making some purer lotions, however I feel that I haven't gotten the combination of quality and cost effectiveness that I want there yet. I had an idea that perhaps a spray bottle solution could be the way to go. I've created a solution that I'm enjoying so far - just want to test it out a little longer on myself and make sure there are no ill effects before listing. But keep an eye out, I hope to launch it within a few weeks!\n\nThe spray solution is comprised of only minimal ingredients and sourced from clean/kosher/halal sources. There are no preservatives - I am relying on the combination of distilled water, high % humectants and a little alcohol to kill off microbes. According to my research this should be sufficient, but ensuring that it will not start to spoil and host bacteria is one of the reasons I am waiting to list. \n\nI'm definitely excited to be able to offer a preservative free, fragrance free, kosher/halal quality product to you all soon!\n\n\\-MPMC",

I know I've mentioned this restoring cream I make a few times on here before, but I'd never gotten around to working out the bottling/selling/business aspect of it until now. Excited to say I've got the first small batch ready and [available on my Etsy shop!](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1643684274/restoring-cream-with-d-panthenol-5?click_key=463db98df09711af1f1fd4345970e44c1a3593c8%3A1643684274&click_sum=88778f65&ref=shop_home_active_1)\n\nThis cream is a combination of several other creams and oils, plus the main active ingredient: D-Panthenol. D-Panthenol is believed to promote hydration and skin recovery, and I've been using this product to great effect for a while now. I always notice a healthy glow/plump feeling in the skin the day after I apply it and hope it will work just as well for many of you. The concentration of D-Panthenol is 5%, which is around the upper end of the accepted range for therapeutic uses. In my opinion a good moisturizer like this one is crucial to the restoration process.\n\nDepending on how it is received by the community, I may offer some bulk discounts or additional versions of the product (such as a half strength or perhaps certified organic version) in the future. If volume of sales increase significantly, I expect to be able to get prices down a bit and hope to pass those on to you all. It is currently listed just under $10, but I'm considering offering a 3-pack for $25 or something like that. Generally for me, 1 bottle lasts 3-4 weeks at least.\n\nPlease feel free to post any thoughts and reviews of the product here. I may be able to tailor future products based on the feedback I get from you all. I believe I have the shop set up to allow for US and international shipping, but please let me know if you run into any issues with ordering! Also bear with me early on if it appears to sell out. I have no idea what to expect in terms of demand or how long my existing inventory will last, but I'll get to replacing it as soon as possible.\n\nI appreciate anyone who decides to support my new small business and hope to make a difference in this community! KOT\n\nEdit: Please click the link in the first paragraph to go directly to my shop. Alternatively, you can type in \"WholeHalfSupply\" to find my store name on Etsy.\n\n\\-MPMC",

D-panthenol has long been used in hair care products for the purpose of anti-hair loss, its effects and the underlying mechanisms, however, were barely reported. \n\nIn this study, the effects of D-panthenol on human hair follicle cells, including dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and outer root sheath cells (hORSCs), were investigated. D-panthenol enhanced the cell viability, increasing the cellular proliferation marker Ki67 in cultured hDPCs. The markers for apoptosis (Caspase3/9) and cell senescence (p21/p16), reported to be expressed in aged or resting phase follicles, were significantly reduced by D-panthenol. Anagen-inducing factors (ALP; β-catenin; versican), which trigger or elongate the anagen phase, were stimulated by D-panthenol. \n\nOn the other hand, D-panthenol reduced TGF-β1 expressions in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of VEGF, which is important for peripheral blood vessel activation; was up-regulated by D-panthenol treatment. \n\nIn cultured hORSCs, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced, while the mRNA expression of cell senescence markers (p21/p16) was significantly down-regulated. The expressions of both VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were up-regulated by D-panthenol. \n\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that the hair growth stimulating activity of D-panthenol was exerted by increasing the cell viability, suppressing the apoptotic markers, and elongating the anagen phase in hair follicles.\n\n[View Full Study](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/43/3/97/htm)",

Apply ketoconazole 2% shampoo to head and affected areas of face, wash off\n\n\n3.I then moisturize with a combo of a touch of squalene and a touch of \"Sebamed Clear Face Care Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Aloe Vera and Provitamin B5\" (got on Amazon), rinse with water to get excess of skin\n\n4.Also taking vitamin d supplement daily\n\n\n\nAlso: using an argan oil conditioner on days I wash my hair (after washing out ketoconazole shampoo, I wash my hair about 3-4 times/week), and limiting heat in shower when water is pointed at head/face, and likewise not using hot water when washing my face out of the shower.\n\n\n\nI've been struggling over the past couple years and this worked so well for me i had to share it\n\nIf it works for me it will likely work for someone else\n\nEdit: added the \"also\" section \n\n",

I was using it every day, and now the yeast are probably starting to adapt. After three months my skin is now starting to flare up again (sorry for that news...but it's just the nature of this issue). So I'm experimenting with a 1% ketoconazole shampoo.      \n     \nI plan on using it for four days (right now I'm on day two of four), then every third day afterwards, and alternating back and forth with T/Sal every two weeks to hopefully keep the yeast dead. I'm assuming there are a few types of those bastards that survive from one antifungal, and hopefully by alternating I can kill 'em all, and keep them that way. This isn't rooted in facts whatsoever, but it's worth a shot.   \n      \nAnyway I also apply MCT oil mixed with a very small bit of pure aloe a few times a day to keep my skin from getting dry, and to keep redness at bay.    \n     \nIt's still not noticable to anyone at this stage, but gets white flakes in the morning...hoping I can keep it at bay again!",

Copy pasting it here below for you all. Ultimately, I would say it can be used at any time that is most convenient for you, and with any quantity that still rubs in nicely like any other lotion. It can be used on the entire penile region, from the shaft skin to inner skin to glans. Paragraph below.\n\nSuggested use: using approximately a penny to nickel sized drop, apply liberally across the desired area. Ensure that it mostly rubs into the skin, leaving little visible afterwards. It may take about 30-60 minutes to feel more completely dry, so it may be desirable to apply shortly before going to bed. This product is believed to be safe for use on any part of the skin, assuming there are no preexisting or underlying health problems in the area. This is not medical advice, however, and you are still advised to use your own judgment or seek alternative medical opinions in the use of this product. \n\nSide note: I am working on formulating other versions of the product that are more natural/possibly organic. Please be patient with me if you are waiting for those. I do have other day jobs as well so I am doing my best to get to it.\n\nThanks to all who have already purchased and shown support! Reviews on Etsy or this sub would be much appreciated.\n\n\\-MPMC",

I was worried first but then noticed most of the clogged glands were expressed. I'm not completely symptom-free but I wanted to share this in case someone else wants to try it. I discovered it as I've read articles that low concentrations of tea-tree oil in shampoos might help.\n\nIt contains: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Teatree-oil), Anthemis Nobilis Oil (Camomile-oil), D-Panthenol, Allantoin, Taurine, Purified Water",

As soon as the skin has completely absorbed this derivative, it is then turned into Vitamin B5. ([via](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-panthenol.htm)) Vitamin B5 is crucial to skin health, and is present in all living cells. When used on the skin, it can help prevent transepidermal water loss, and can improve chronically dry skin.\n\nRemember Pantene Pro-V? \"Pantene\" like Panthenol, \"pro-v\" like Provitamin B! Panthenol is a strong humectant and as such can moisturize and give \"body\" to hair. It also tends to coat hair in a mostly uniform layer, so it can help add consistent shine to hair. Panthenol is capable of penetrating the cuticle and entering the hair shaft as well, where it aids in moisture retention and provides volume ([via](http://www.curlynikki.com/2012/06/science-behind-using-panthenol-in-hair.html)).\n\nPanthenol is soluble in multiple substances, including water, meaning it should rinse cleanly without harsh cleansing/foaming agents. \n\nMay be of synthetic, animal, or plant origin. It is naturally occurring in the body. Panthenol is not considered to be ecotoxic/damaging to the environment or ecosystems. It is not bioaccumulative in the body (doesn't \"build up\" in the body with multiple, repeated exposures). ",

Also, you need to use Malassezia safe shampoo, face wash, and SPF. Put this solution in a bottle that squeezes out nicely onto your scalp and massage it in.\n\nWith the ingredients you’ve collected, we can create a highly effective liquid serum targeting fungal overgrowth, itching, and flaking caused by Malassezia. Below is a custom formula for a Calming Seborrheic Serum:\n\n\n---\n\nIngredients and Functions\n\n1. Tea Tree Oil – Potent antifungal and anti-inflammatory.\n\n\n2. Grapefruit Seed Extract – Antimicrobial, helps reduce fungal growth.\n\n\n3. Powdered Xylitol – Discourages Malassezia yeast growth.\n\n\n4. Rosemary Essential Oil – Antifungal, improves circulation, and soothes irritation.\n\n\n5. 99% Aloe Vera Gel – Hydrates, soothes inflammation, and serves as a base.\n\n\n6. Liquid Colloidal Silver (250ppm) – Antimicrobial, reduces skin irritation.\n\n\n7. MCT Oil Powder – Lightweight, hydrating without feeding Malassezia.\n\n\n8. Apple Cider Vinegar – Balances scalp pH to inhibit fungal growth.\n\n\n9. Black Seed Oil – Antimicrobial, reduces inflammation, and nourishes the skin.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n50ml Liquid Serum Formula\n\n1. Base:\n\n20ml Aloe Vera Gel (hydration, soothing)\n\n10ml Colloidal Silver (antimicrobial base)\n\n5ml Apple Cider Vinegar (pH balancing, antifungal)\n\n\n\n2. Actives:\n\n3-4 drops Tea Tree Oil (antifungal)\n\n3-4 drops Rosemary Essential Oil (antifungal, calming)\n\n1ml Grapefruit Seed Extract (antimicrobial boost)\n\n1/4 tsp Powdered Xylitol (inhibits yeast; dissolve first)\n\n\n\n3. Lipids:\n\n2ml Black Seed Oil (anti-inflammatory, nourishing)\n\n2ml MCT Oil Powder (hydration and lightweight emollience)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nPreparation Steps\n\n1. Dissolve Xylitol: Mix the powdered xylitol in a small amount (2-3ml) of warm colloidal silver or aloe vera gel to ensure it dissolves completely.\n\n\n2. Combine Base Ingredients: In a clean mixing bowl, combine the aloe vera gel, colloidal silver, and apple cider vinegar. Stir gently.\n\n\n3. Add Actives: Add tea tree oil, rosemary oil, grapefruit seed extract, and the dissolved xylitol solution to the base. Mix well.\n\n\n4. Incorporate Lipids: Add black seed oil and MCT oil powder into the mixture. Stir or shake the mixture well to emulsify (you may notice slight separation; this is normal for oil/water blends).\n\n\n5. Transfer to Bottle: Using a funnel, pour the mixture into a clean glass dropper bottle (50ml). Shake thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nApplication Instructions\n\nShake the serum well before each use to re-emulsify the ingredients.\n\nApply 5-10 drops directly to your scalp, focusing on affected areas.\n\nGently massage into the scalp.\n\nUse 1-2 times daily or as needed.\n\n\n\n---\n\nStorage\n\nStore the serum in a cool, dark place.\n\nWithout added preservatives, the serum will last about 2-3 weeks if handled properly.\n\nIf you want longer shelf life, add a natural preservative like Optiphen Plus (0.5-1%) or refrigerate the serum.\n\n\n\n---\n\nKey Notes\n\n1. pH Balance: Apple cider vinegar keeps the formula acidic (pH ~4.5-5.5), which helps prevent Malassezia overgrowth.\n\n\n2. Patch Test: Always perform a patch test before use to ensure no sensitivity to essential oils or other ingredients.\n\n\n3. Customizations: If the formula feels too oily or too acidic, you can reduce the oil quantities or dilute the apple cider vinegar slightly.\n\n\nHere are some additional ingredients that could enhance the formula's effectiveness and match the goals of a soothing, antifungal serum for seborrheic dermatitis:\n\n\n---\n\nAdditional Ingredients to Consider\n\n1. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)\n\nAnti-inflammatory, reduces redness, and strengthens the skin barrier.\n\nDosage: 2-5% of the total formula.\n\n\n\n2. Panthenol (Provitamin B5)\n\nSoothing and hydrating, promotes healing of irritated skin.\n\nDosage: 1-3%.\n\n\n\n3. Zinc PCA\n\nAntifungal, sebum-regulating, and soothing.\n\nDosage: 0.5-1%.\n\n\n\n4. Climbazole\n\nA strong antifungal specifically effective against Malassezia.\n\nDosage: 0.1-0.5%.\n\n\n\n5. Squalane\n\nA lightweight, non-comedogenic oil that hydrates without feeding fungal growth.\n\nDosage: Add a few drops if the formula feels too drying.\n\n\n\n6. Cucumber Extract\n\nSoothing and hydrating, helps with inflammation and irritation.\n\nDosage: 5-10%.\n\n\n\n7. Green Tea Extract\n\nAntioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.\n\nDosage: 3-5%.\n\n\n\n8. Vitamin E (Tocopherol)\n\nAntioxidant that protects the formula and soothes the skin.\n\nDosage: 0.5-1%.\n\n\n\n9. Sulfur (Colloidal or Precipitated)\n\nAntifungal and keratolytic, effective for severe flaking.\n\nDosage: 2-5% (must be used carefully due to odor and skin sensitivity).\n\n\n\n10. Glycerin or Propanediol\n\nHumectants that add hydration without feeding fungus.\n\nDosage: 2-5%.",

Although I have silicone on my glans 7/24, I think it has keratinized more due to the pressure of the device because it flakes off my glans and the sensation on the glans has decreased.

I just bought some, and I was wondering if you had any tips on formulating with it.\n\nI'm by no means an expert, but a couple of thoughts on the mixture:\n\n- The measurements are in both ml and grams; I would probably just measure everything in grams, just to keep it consistent.\n\n- 200 ml of tea tree water seems like a lot, given that the other ingredients (except for argan and jojoba oil) add up to 37.3%. Assuming that the total mixture adds up to 300g, that would leave 188.1g for both the tea tree water and the oils.\n\n- In lotions that I've made, I've used about 10% oil, which has turned out pretty well. I didn't find it too greasy, but I think it depends a lot on the oil used and personal preference. Maybe you could try making a small test batch first (30g or less)? I've also made test base lotions, i.e., just water, oil, and emulsifier--no actives or extracts--just to get a sense of how the lotion would feel and how much emulsifier I need.\n\n- What is the emulsifier in the mixture? I see that the saccharomyces and the \"1st mixture\" have lecithin, but from what I've read, lecithin requires a co-emulsifier.

I wash the facial massage off with a spearmint face scrub.”\n\n“In the shower I use first a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.”\n\n“Vidal Sassoon shampoo is especially good at getting rid of the coating of dried perspiration, salts, oils, airborne pollutants and dirt that can weigh down hair and flatten it to the scalp which can make you look older.The conditioner is also good – silicone technology permits conditioning benefits without weighing down the hair which can also make you look older.”\n\n“On weekends or before a date I prefer to use the Greune Natural Revitalizing Shampoo, the conditioner and the Nutrient Complex. These are formulas that contain D-panthenol, a vitamin-B-complex factor; polysorbate 80, a cleansing agent for the scalp; and natural herbs.”\n\n“Over the weekend I plan to go to Bloomingdale’s or Bergdorf’s and on Evelyn’s advice pick up a Foltene European Supplement and Shampoo for thinning hair which contains complex carbohydrates that penetrate the hair shafts for improved strength and shine. Also the Vivagen Hair Enrichment Treatment, a new Redken product that prevents mineral deposits and prolongs the life cycle of hair. Luis Carruthers recommended the Aramis Nutriplexx system, a nutrient complex that helps increase circulation.”\n\n“Once out of the shower and toweled dry I put the Ralph Lauren boxers back on and before applying the Mousse A Raiser, a shaving cream by Pour Hommes, I press a hot towel against my face for two minutes to soften abrasive beard hair.”\n\n“Then I always slather on a moisturizer (to my taste, Clinique) and let it soak in for a minute. You can rinse it off or keep it on and apply a shaving cream over it – preferably with a brush, which softens the beard as it lifts the whiskers – which I’ve found makes removing the hair easier.Leave the sideburns and chin for last, since these whiskers are tougher and need more time to soften. Rinse the razor and shake off any excess water before starting.”\n\n“Afterwards splash cool water on the face to remove any trace of lather. You should use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol. Never use cologne on your face, since the high alcohol content dries your face out and makes you look older. One should use an alcohol-free antibacterial toner with a water-moistened cotton ball to normalize the skin.”\n\n“Applying a moisturizer is the final step. Splash on water before applying an emollient lotion to soften the skin and seal in the moisture.”\n\n“Next apply Gel Appaisant, also made by Pour Hommes, which is an excellent, soothing skin lotion. If the face seems dry and flaky – which makes it look dull and older – use a clarifying lotion that removes flakes and uncovers fine skin (it can also make your tan look darker).”\n\n“Then apply an anti-aging eye balm (Baume Des Yeux) followed by a final moisturizing “protective” lotion.”\n\n“A scalp-programming lotion is used after I towel my hair dry. I also lightly blow-dry the hair to give it body and control (but without stickiness) and then add more of the lotion, shaping it with a Kent natural- bristle brush, and finally slick it back with a wide-tooth comb.”\"",

I came across it about a week ago when several local skincare Instagram accounts received a PR packaged from them and I got curious. \n\nRight now they just released 2 products, a moisturiser and a gel cleanser, and honestly looking from the ingredient list I’m quite impressed. PLUS both seemed to quite affordable I think? \n\nGENTLE CLEANSER\nIngredients: \nAqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Propanediol, Ahnfeltiopsis Concinna Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Hydroxy-ethyl Cellulose, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nBARRIER DEFENDER \nIngredients:\nAqua, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, C10-30 Cholesterol/Lanosterol Esters, Capric/Caprylic Triglyceride, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Propanediol, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Ceramide IIIB, Hydrolysed Silk, D-Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol.\n\nHonestly I’m pretty tempted on trying the cleanser because of how simple it is. I’ve always wanted to try a local brand too so for fellow Singaporeans, maybe you guys can give it a try too and share your thoughts on it? \n\nThey’re available on Shopee and their website I think? Do check out their Instagram account if you are interested in them @5to5skin. \n\nMan I guess it’s time for me to quickly use up my current cleanser XD. What are your thoughts on their current products and maybe even their brand as a whole?",

I've not heard of the brand but looking at the price and ingredients, the price looks reasonable based on singapore standards, but really depends on your budget. \n\nThe cleanser based on the ingredients should cleanse relatively fine but can be slightly moisturizing. 1% mark should be at Propanediol. Personally i'd prefer the Glutamate to be the main surfactant but it's probably lower in percentage due to the cost. It's short of an amphoteric surfactant to bring down the potential harshness. \n\nThe moisturizer based on the ingredients should slightly rich due to the number of emollients in the formula. 1% mark should be at Stearic Acid. It should take some time to \"absorb\" due to the Jojoba slightly higher on the list.",

But holy smokes you'd want to make sure that your hair responds well to those specific types of proteins and also dial it way back.\n\n10% oil is also a lot.\n\nI'm not familiar with using that particular preservative -- just noting that so you don't think that a lack of mention means it's all good. \n\nAloe is extremely difficult to preserve. You should consider using a powdered form -- I've done plain aloe thinking I didn't need to listen to the advice of this subreddit and was definitely wrong. Powder is so much more consistent and nice to work with.\n\nHave you ever made a bare-bones emulsion of just water & BTMS-50+Cetyl alcohol? You'll honestly learn a ton just from doing that to start out before making either of these. Could also use it as an opportunity to test out the protein types/amounts by incorporating it into the water phase for these trials.",

        "body": "About your preservative. It took a bit of digging, but I found a reasonable, and hopefully more accurate, usage rate for you than drops per grams. Drops per ml is not going to be the same as drops per grams, which is what the instructions I found for Paraben K used.\n\nParaben K has almost nothing I can find in English, and my German is nonexistent. Google translate can only do so much, and I couldn't find any documentation with a real usage rate for Paraben K. Paraben K is associated with Spinnrad, which doesn't seem to be a manufacturer but I couldn't tell because of the language problem. Clariant makes a preservative with the same INCI called Nipaguard MPA. It's not common either, but I got more results.\n\nDigging through versions of Clariant preservative brochures, I found one from 2014 that mentions the usage rates of Nipaguard MPA. Recommended 0.3-0.8% with a maximum of 1.32% in the EU. Direct PDF link: https://biokhimact.com.ua/images/catalogs/new/Preservative_Brochure.pdf\n\nIt is a much older refernce, but according to the Handbook of Preservatives (2003) the recommended usage rate for Nipaguard MPA is 0.3-0.6%. Here's the link to the page in Google Books: https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ2QB7bu5LwC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=nipaguard+mpa&source=bl&ots=6P2ZqxDVt2&sig=ACfU3U2HP4hEMfQsoFJ34ZPg8BmuU81Oww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgn7Sry6bvAhUBpp4KHXBbAxc4MhDoATAEegQIDBAD#v=onepage&q=nipaguard%20mpa&f=false\n\nNo other manufacturer seems to make this particular blend, so I suspect that Clariant is the original source.\n\nGiven how much protein and aloe and the mint tea, I would strongly recommend that you use no less than 1% Paraben K by weight. Parabens are great against mold, which is the most likely thing you'd be able to notice without sending samples to a lab, but even they have their limit. The fact that both of these have a quat in them will help, but make small batches, use new packaging every time, and be ready to throw it away if either one changes in smell, color, or thickness after the first day.\n\nFor preservation and hair and scalp health, make sure that the pH for either of these is under 6. Don't just add a gram of citric acid to the second one without a reason and without measuring. I like my shampoo and conditioner fairly acidic, 5 to 4.5, but 5.5 to 6.5 is more typical in commercial products.\n\nYou can't guess at pH. Any way of measuring is better than none.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nPlease call them Hair Sauce and Hair Broth. Because that is a lot of protein and I think it would be funny. I am a bad person, this an attempt at a joke.\n\nPut the tea tree oil in the cool down, not the heated phase.\n\nTry using less glycerin and panthenol in the leave in if you find it sticky. Or none.\n\nDrop the aloe to 10% in both of them. Or 20% at most. 40% is far past the point of diminishing returns. More is not always better, and it makes them much harder to preserve.\n\nHydrolyzed collagen peptide powder (yes, same as the food kind) between 0.5 and 2% in the deep conditioner. This is my favorite hair protein. I also use paraben preservatives, because otherwise I'd have to call my conditioner Mold Culture Medium.\n\nFor your leave in, try some amodimethicone. It's basically the unnatural grafting of protein to a light silicone. Works better than regular protein and a quat for smoothing damage, and it doesn't build up. It adheres to hair, but not to itself, and it washes out with regular shampoo, as long as the shampoo has at least some anionic surfactant in it.",

I use d-Panthenol a lot in my recipes for its skin conditioning/anti-acne benefits, but find even at 1% it makes every formula notoriously sticky... Esp in a HA Gel base.\n\nI know SkinCeuticals uses Calcium Pant. as the \"B5\" in their Hydrating B5 Gel. I've added CP at 1% and 2% (max) to HA Gel recipes and found it has NONE of the typical drawbacks of d-Panthenol. Gel is not sticky, dries immediately, leaves behind no heavy film.\n\nMy question... is using CP an effective way to get the traditional skin benefits of B5/panthenol? Is it more or less potent than d-Panthenol? Does the skin absorb it effectively (CP is a solid powder)?\n\nMy only understanding of CP is that its the \"salt form\" of panth & the type of B5 used typically in oral supplements. Obv since it is a salt/electrolyte, CP isn't compatible with all thickeners/emulsifiers (unlike d-Panth which usually is). The \"non-sticky\" tradeoff is worth it to me though.",

But all the hydration in these simple formulations comes from the glycerin in the extracts, and I'd love to try some more sophisticated hydration formulas. (and I have combo, acne prone skin so I definitely prefer watery hydration over emulsions & creams)    \n\nAfter spending some time on Point of Interest, I identified some ingredients I'm interested in trying out, so I was going to experiment with them first in a toner type product.    \n\nHow does this look?  \n5% niacinamide  \n5% centella extract  \n5% licorice root extract  \n3% honeyquat*  \n2% hydrolyzed oats*  \n2% panthenol*   \n0.5% allantoin*  \n0.2-0.5% sodium citrate* (for chelating + pH adjusting; my previous toner was pH 4.5 - a pinch low)  \n1% germaben II  \n(distilled h2o to 100%)   \n\nAsterisk denotes an ingred I haven't worked with before. So I'm not certain about amounts (I chose based on Susan's recipes, but she doesn't have any that are exactly this combination ofc so I'm open to adjustment); also not certain if any of them are harder to work with (less water soluble) - out of these, I know allantoin and maybe panthenol may be tricky? I've read not to go above 0.5% with the allantoin either, so I didn't   \n\nAlso - I order my ingreds from lotioncrafter and note they only have dl-panthenol powder. POI mentioned that it can be found as d-panthenol and in liquid form (both of which are preferable to me!), but I'm not sure which suppliers carry this? Saw this on Amazon but not sure if legit https://www.amazon.com/Provitamin-B5-d-panthenol-2-0floz-60ml/dp/B005VEE58I\n\nAny feedback appreciated!!  \n\nAlso, I only make an ounce at a time so even if something goes wrong I'd just waste ~$1 (and my time lol)",

That said, some products that come to mind:\n\nEucerin Redness Relief Night Cream (panthenol, licorice)\n\nLRP Cicaplast B5 — generally calming with zinc and lots of other goodies \n\nAvene Cicalfate restore and protect (zinc, copper)\n\nStratia Liquid Gold (if your skin is okay with niacinamide, this is a fantastic barrier serum with ceramides and other good things)\n\nYMMV (your mileage may vary), and it can be a slow process to figure out how to respond to your skin’s signals. It CAN be done, especially with support from a derm.\n\nSome other thoughts are to consider cleansing once daily instead of twice. Many of us here only use water in the morning, and find that improves our type 2 rosacea. I also would explode with type 2 if I didn’t use thick moisturizers every night BUT truly everyone’s skin is different, and 40-year-old skin (me) is different from 23-year-old skin. \n\nWishing you luck!\n\nEdit: fixed typos",

Rosacea is manageable and treatable; all you need is to find what works for your skin.\n\nI also have type 2 Rosacea and what helps/helped me calm down my skin is/was:\n\n1. Dropping CeraVe products (I used to love them, until I realised the constant burning, irritation and bumps wasn't my Rosacea being mean to me but rather adverse reactions to their formulas);\n2. Dropping any and all niacinamide, since it's known to irritate skin;\n3. Using Avène Eau Thermale to soothe my skin mid-flush (sometimes even ice packs);\n4. Stop drinking alcohol (never really liked it anyway) and lowering my consumption of spicy foods - I still do eat them, though;\n5. Never wash my face in the shower or with warm/hot water, always cool;\n6. Sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen;\n7. Oral Spironolactone helped control my papules - I currently take 100mg;\n8. Not touching my skin during the day;\n9. Metronidazole also helped with controlling papules during my worst flare ups, but I've been out of it now for 3 months.\n\nI do flush still. It does get uncomfortable sometimes. I still struggle. But those things above help me deal with it. I tried Azelaic Acid but my skin didn't like it at all. It's very picky, it sucks, but eh...\n\nTo be fair, they help so much I was even able to start Tretinoin without side effects. And, yes, the sandwich method is AMAZING and it works!\n\nEdit to clarify about the Tret: my skin didn't purge and the Tret didn't irritate it. I'm on 0.025%, using it 6 days a week, and only experience peeling due to retinization.\n\nEdit 2: The products I use are Bioderma Sensibio AR moisturiser, Vichy Normaderm cleanser, Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water makeup remover, Tretinoin 0.025% gel, La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMUNE 400 sunscreen, Vaseline Aloe Vera Lip Therapy and, 1x a week, a pink clay mask.",

I mean, if you think about it, you are nuking all good and bad  bacteria. Im not sure about CPC, but triclosan does, and I assume CPC  acts similarly, so should you just avoid it? Maybe once a week in case  there's a buildup of bad bacteria and you can then \"reset\" it with a  mouthwash? but then again, what if by doing a reset, the balance between  good and bad is modified? Im not sure what to do. Dentists just want to  sell you their stuff from the assorted catalogue, they wouldn't even  care about of this our point to how \"it's not proven\" but common sense  says that removing good and bad bacteria is probably not a way to go.\n\nI've  read about how xylitol somehow knows how to attack only bad bacteria  but for some reason the mouthwashes always end up adding other dodgy  stuff. Also, what if what you are using eventually becomes weak and bad bacteria beats xylitol and becomes more powerful vs if you just had a good natural balance with a good microbiome? If so, how would one achieve a better microbiome? I've read dr Ray Peat claim how thyroid status is important since if it's not ideal then the saliva quality decreases. Most drs (and specially dentists) don't look at it that way, they will just sold you some product but not go into the details.",

My 2C hair has gotten pretty long and I've found the best way to handle it is with lighter products in large quantities to coat it all, but not weight it down. This gel is light but provides hold and makes my curls really tighten and pop when I scrunch it wet.\n\nRecipe:\n\n* Distilled Water to 100%\n\n* 1.5% Xanthan Gum\n\n* 1% D-Panthenol Liquid (optional but adds conditioning)\n\n*  3% Vegetable Glycerin\n* .25%Vitamin E (dl-alpha tocopherol) \n* Enough citric acid to get pH between 4-5. (I last used about .25g for 300g of gel). Keeping the gel a little acid helps with frizz and shine.\n\n*   1% Germaben II \n\nDirections. \n\n1. In your mixing beaker or cup, Mix the panthenol and glycerin with the xanthan gum until you form a paste. This will ease the mixing in of water. \n\n2. Add in your distilled water. I've been heating the water in the microwave for like 1-1:30 min. I think it makes the mixing easier. The water should be warm, not hot or boiling or it can inactivate the Germaben II.\n\n3. Mix with a stick blender.\n\n4. Add your preservative and the vitamin E.  Mix again.\n\n5. Add in citric acid very slowly to get to pH\n\n6. Bottle and enjoy! Remember this is meant to be used generously to really coat your curls. I use about 2 tablespoons for my hair that is a couple of inches past my armpit.",

The human body readily absorbs DL-Panthenol through the skin and it rapidly converts D-Panthenol to Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5), a natural constituent of healthy hair and a substance present in all living cells. Only D-Panthenol is converted to Vitamin B5 and not the L-Panthenol. So the racemic D,L-Panthenol has only half of the physiological activity of D-Panthenol in skin care. \nStudies have shown D-Panthenol promotes stimulation of epithelization, granulation, mitigation of itching and has an anti-inflammatory effect.  When used in formulations over the course of three to four weeks, it has the potential to improve the appearance of the skin, including dryness, roughness, scaling, pruritus and erythema.  Further, its moisturizing properties improve stratum corneum hydration, reducing transepidermal water loss and maintaining skin elasticity and softness. Panthenol also works with DMAE in the production of acetylcholine which firms and tones the skin. \nBoth D-Panthenol and DL-Panthenol are equally effective for moisturization, improvement of hair structure and adding luster and sheen to the hair.  \nThis is a cosmetic raw material and is meant for external use only in cosmetic formulations.

It is substantive and moisturizing and with it's low molecular weight, able to penetrate hair to provide its moisturizing benefits over time while providing shine and luster. Honeyquat will improve wet-combability of the hair and reduce static buildup when dry combing.\r\nSolubility & Formulating Information\r\r\nHoneyquat PF is freely soluble in water and in aqueous alcohol (60/40).  It is soluble at 1% in the following materials:  propylene glycol, ammonium myreth sulfate (60%) and cocoamidopropyl betaine.  It is not soluble in oils and esters.\r\n\rUnlike many conventional conditioning agents, Honeyquat PFwill not reduce the foam of anionic and non-ionic surfactants.  It can easily be formulatied with carbomers to form clear gels, provided that they are pre-neutralized.  A slight loss in viscosity will result but can easily be compensated for by using 10% more carbomer by weight. The preferred carbomers include Carbopol 1342, ETD 2020, 941 and 940.\r\n\rHoneyquat PF is ideal for substantive humectants for skin and hair, leave-on and rinse-off applications, softening and plasticizing skin, improving feel and styleability of hair.\r\n\rRecommended usage level: 2 - 5%. \r\nAppearance: Clear, to slightly hazy, pale straw colored liquid \r\nPreserved by manufacturer with: Sorbic Acid 0.2 - 0.4%\r\nSolubility: Soluble in water, insoluble in oils and esters.\r\n\rCountry of Origin: USA \r\nINCI: Hydroxypropyltrimonium Honey\"",

    "body": "Hey all. Apologies to those who were interested/looking for my lotion products and such lately. I took a bit of an unintentional hiatus for a combination of health reasons, work problems, and supply problems on my lotion products.\n\nI'm back and looking to see if there would still be much interest in a [D-Panthenol spray I've developed](https://www.reddit.com/r/foreskin_restoration/comments/1bm65iu/working_on_new_dpanthenol_spray/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I've tested it as shelf stable for several months now, and believe that it is safe and effective. In order to make it additive/preservative free, I've included a rather high vegetable glycerin content, which does make it feel a bit \"thicker\", and take longer to dry - however, I think that this is better than using preservatives and other inorganic chemicals. Especially considering the health forward mindset of subs like this.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested. I will get it ready for sale shortly if there is demand! I can also reintroduce stock for my existing lotion, but I am optimistic that this spray may be able to completely replace that as it is more organic/pure and a simpler formulation.\n\nI will try to keep production steady this time around and avoid any hiatus like this again. It is tough to balance work with this and life overall. To be honest it would almost just be easier to sell my recipes to someone who had time and wanted to get it produced on a bigger scale, but I will try to find the time to keep it in stock this time around.",

So make sure your other ingredients will be happy in that pH range too.\n\n\nOne other thing that is really a matter of preference, for me 3% glycerin would probably be a bit high for a leave-on product.

    "body": "Hi, r/sca,\n\nI am a woman in her twenties who has gained so much knowledge from this sub! Part of that is examining my routine and my products. I own derma-e's tea tree/vitamin e creme and I have used it for years and found it to be beneficial for my skin. Recently,  I found another derma-e product on sale for $4 at my local grocery chain (the product in the post title). I figured, since it's so cheap, I'll buy it and try it out. So far, I like it, hasn't broken me out, and smells nice. I've used it about once a week for the last few weeks. \n\n[Here is the Amazon link] (https://www.amazon.com/derma-Anti-Wrinkle-Vitamin-Retinyl-Palmitate/dp/B00021KD2C) to the product. I am not looking for a retinol product, and I have done research here and elsewhere on the Internet about the efficacy of this product and its ingredients, but I'm confused. Has anyone used this product and seen any positive results? Should I ditch the product--I've read conflicting things about retinyl palmitate and cancer. Is the amount of r.p. strong enough, given how far down it is in the list of ingredients? I'm not expecting a miracle creme, but there *is* a lot of product in the tub and if it's not a worthy product, I have no issue looking into other alternatives. I have sensitive skin and as I said, it's not irritated by this creme.\n\nHere are the ingredients (also shown in the link):\n>Purified Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Alcohol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Retinyl Palmitate(Vitamin A), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Allantoin, Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Essential Oil, Phenylethyl Alcohol, Vanillin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nClaims:\n>Helps diminish the appearance of age lines and wrinkles on the skin while leaving it soft, smooth, and supple. This hi-potency vitamin A (10,000 IU/100gm) cream is formulated with vitamins E, D and allantoin for an extra-rich moisturizing treatment. Vitamin A encourage cell renewal enhancing your skin's youthful appearance.\n\nThanks! ",

I chopped my mane 2 years ago & I am in the painful process of growing it back out. I have **always** used 'curly girl approved' drugstore products for my entire routine - like Shea Moisture, John Frida, Not Your Mother's etc. They all worked perfectly but I have been trying to r/ZeroWaste, so I switched those for natural products. My actual routine has been the same **FOR YEARS**: I co-wash (using prayer hands technique), and scrunch-dry with an old t-shirt outside of the shower, scrunch-dry my gel into semi-dry hair.\n\nSo, I switched over to haircare bars from my local shop! I used this shampoo & conditioner.. the makeshift pair were amazingly for three months. I was hesitant to use them because they contained sodium ***coco*** sulfate.. I know that SLS is the devil of curly hair, but I thought I'd be safe with this natural sulfate.\n\nRecently, they have been leaving my hair feeling dry and feeling like straw... my hair has absolutely no life. I am afraid this change is because of the natural sulfate in the bars, despite the conditioner being 'specifically for curly hair'. I don't know what to do next... does anyone know any organic/natural hair products to use? Should I just go back to drugstore stuff?\n\n[Shampoo ingredients:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner-1) sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, matcha green tea, french green clay, shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, isosteareth, dimethicone copolyol, ichthammol, stinging nettle extract, and d-panthenol (essential oils of: peppermint, eucalyptus, rosemary, cerdar wood, and bergamot) \n\n[Conditioner bar:](https://www.gabeandangel.com/product-page/the-hydrator-shampoo-conditioner) behentrimonium methosulfate (from rapeseed oil), cetearyl (natural emulsifier and conditioner), cocoa butter, shea butter, olive oil, cetyl, coconut oil, glycerin, jojoba oil, wheat germ oil, sweet almond oil, d-panthenol, organic aloe vera, cyclomethicone, and vitamin E (essential oils of: coriander seed, juniper berry, sweet orange, palmarosa, geranium, cardamom, and patchouli)",

In addition, since you aren't doing great, this may br a problwm for you. But Dimethicone copolyol is water soluable, so the shampoo bar is ok!\n\nNow, since you have been using a sulfate, it probably hasn't built up too badly. But I think you are proving the case in favor of the CG method.\n\nThere are many organic/natural products to use, but you still have to be a little careful. Giovanni is a trused natural haircare producer, and many of their products are CG friendly, but many aren't. Take a look at their website. They have many new lines to try. Plug the ingredients into www.isitcg.com to double check if it is ok. If you see something you like, but are still unsure, post here to see get opinions, if any.

That aside, I’m curious to hear your overall thoughts on the formula, does it seem well balanced to you and how do you think it might affect the hair and the scalp?\n\nSince I didn’t add a preservative, I’ve only used the shampoo three times so far and have decided not to continue using it just in case. However, I noticed that my hair stays cleaner and fuller for longer compared to commercial shampoos I’ve been using, it doesn’t get flat or greasy as quickly. Still, as I'm inexperienced, I wonder if there’s anything in the formula that might not be suitable for long-term use.",

        "body": "Hey, congrats on your first solid shampoo formulation! 🙌 You’ve clearly put a lot of care into choosing your ingredients – it's a thoughtful blend with emollients, occlusives, mild surfactants, and nice functional actives like panthenol and urea. Love seeing that.\n\nA few notes that might help as you refine it:\n\n* **Preservative**: Since you’ve added lavender tea (aka a water-based ingredient), your formula is no longer fully anhydrous. Even a small amount of water can introduce microbial risk, especially if the bar stays damp between uses. I'd definitely recommend adding a broad-spectrum preservative next time. It’s not just about safety — it also protects the integrity of your formula. (And don’t forget: your preservative effectiveness will depend on pH! check supplier recommendations for pH range and usage amount)\n* **pH**: Speaking of pH — have you measured it? SCI bars can lean a bit acidic or alkaline depending on how you process them. For hair and scalp comfort, aim for something between **4.5–5.5**. It’s worth investing in pH strips or a digital meter.\n* **Surfactants**: Using SCI as your sole surfactant works, but you might get an even gentler and more flexible texture if you blend it with a secondary surfactant. Something like **Coco Glucoside** or **Cocamidopropyl Betaine** can boost mildness, lather, and rinseability.\n* **Conditioning**: If you’d like more slip or detangling effect, try incorporating a small % of **cationic ingredients** like **Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (\\~1%)** or **BTMS-50 (2–3%)**. It really helps with smoothness and manageability.\n* **Oils and butters**: The total oil phase is a little high, which might make the bar soft or greasy for some hair types. If it feels a bit mushy, consider reducing total oil load slightly and adding a **hardener** like **Cetearyl Alcohol** to maintain structure and durability.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn’t throw it away. If you’ve kept it dry between uses, it's likely still safe short-term. But next batch, preservative it is 😉\n\nLet us know how it evolves — you’re definitely on the right track!",

        "body": "Hi, welcome to this sub. Agreeing with everything u/ashley_swonlab says, here are some extra notes:\n\nIf you write out a formulation, please use percents, not grams. Using percents makes it way easier to interpret the formulation.\n\nI would also use way less oils/fats, if any at all. The job of a cleansing formulation is to attach to dirt, which generally is lipophilic (fat solvable) in character, and make it hydrophilic (water solvable) so that it can be rinsed away with water. The surfactant(s) in the formulation, here SCI, will do this job. By adding a lot of fats/oils to the formulation, a large part of the SCI will be busy to take on those built-in fats/oils and are not available any more to attack the dirt. The result is less cleansing power and less foam. Fatty alcohols like cetearyl alcohol will also build solidity but will not harm the surfactant's effectiveness that much.\n\nIf you add those fats/oils to make the formulation smoother, indeed better add conditioners. I also sometimes use Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, but lately mostly a polyquat, like polyquaternium-10, or P[CA glyceryl oleate](https://www.glenncorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dermofeel-P-30-MB.-TDS.-04.01.19.pdf).\n\nAdding a co-surfactant like Cocamidopropyl Betaine not only may boost mildness, lather, and rinseability, it also makes it easier to solve the SCI. It's best to first mix the SCI into the liquid co-surfactants so that you get a thick paste (it will be less thick if you heat it a little) and then add the other components.\n\nBe aware that adding liquid D-panthenol, glucosides, and glycerine can make the bar more vulnerable to breaking.

Though I’m sure it has, lol. Obviously, very cheap skincare can be a little suspicious.\n\nFor $4.99 I decided to take a chance on the night cream. I’ve used it for 3 days now and my initial impression is that it’s kind of meh. It has a fragrance, which I personally think is pleasant but others may not care for or may be reactive to.  It kind of feels more like it’s sitting on top of my skin than sinking into it, but it’s not sticky or heavy feeling, which is nice. It doesn’t seem to be clogging my pores or causing any reactions, but it’s still pretty early to know for sure. \n\nTonight, I’m trying to take advantage of this “laying on top of” thing by layering it over my normal moisturizer (Elf Daily Hydration Moisturizer). Maybe it will act like a thinner Vaseline and really help lock it in? I hope so haha, otherwise I might not finish the jar. \n\nI’m wondering if anyone has any thoughts, opinions, or experiences with Lacura’s products. Are any of the other products worth a shot? Am I burning a hole in my face with this cheap night cream and should bin it immediately?\n\nFor reference, here’s the ingredients for the night cream: Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Phospholipids, Ubiquinone, Propylene Glycol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Retinol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil Unsaponifiables, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Dimethicone, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Tocopherol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Lecithin, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid.",

    "body": "I have a batch of 20 chicks, now about 2 weeks old, and first one of them got a wry neck, after which I added to their water a [vitamin-mineral supplement](https://www.hankkija.fi/rehut/nautojen-rehut/ia-xylitol-monivimin-liuos-5-l-2003096/) (A, D3, E, K3, B1, B2, B6, B12, Biotin, D-Panthenol, Niacin, Selenium) to treat the possible deficiencies which might be causing it, but after that 2 more birds have gotten the exact same wry neck condition which the first bird had, meaning that they necks are identically crooked (neck tilted to the side but the head is not upside down so they can eat and drink normally but just look weird). The wry neck birds are otherwise totally fine expect the neck, meaning they eat and drink good and seem as energetic as the others.\n\nI also lost 2 bird from this batch to an unknown cause and to some other type of wry neck. The first bird was just looking weak and then one day he was just dead and the second one started to lose it's balance so that he ended up on his side and one his back and seemed to not be able to get up. His condition just gradually worsened so that he wasn't even able to eat or drink anymore, so I had to end him.\n\nMy biggest worry now is that could this be some type of decease which is causing this wry neck epidemic in this batch, since I feed them the exact same feed (chick starter) I feed my other quails and they have never had anything like this, that they would have develop some type of condition which they didn't have before from birth.\n\nI'm not totally ruling out the deficiency possibility either (E, D or some B vitamin deficiency) and hence I currently give all my birds this before mentioned [vitamin-mineral supplement](https://www.hankkija.fi/rehut/nautojen-rehut/ia-xylitol-monivimin-liuos-5-l-2003096/), because\n\n1. I have had chicks which have been born with the wry neck condition, so in those cases I think the reason could be a some type of nutritional deficiency, and hence it could be that this chick started feed I use might actually be low on some key nutrients.\n2. The previous quails I hatched before this batch have had always at some point [this specific quail feed](https://www.zooplus.fi/shop/linnut/ravinto/kanat/1410322?activeVariant=1410322.0&mkt_source=1454404&awc=23602_1721342325_237c92d9b5891297244f7e77bb39b8d6) which has a lot more added vitamins and minerals compared to this chick started I currently give my birds, so it could be that the other birds avoided this condition because they had always access to that specific quail feed (which costs triple the price the chick started costs by the way).\n\nHowever though, 3 birds (out of 20) getting the wry neck inside 7 day peridot, inside just one batch, in my opinion can't be a nutritional deficiency issue especially when 2 of them have developed it while they were on the [vitamin-mineral supplement](https://www.hankkija.fi/rehut/nautojen-rehut/ia-xylitol-monivimin-liuos-5-l-2003096/).\n\nI also on top of adding the vitamin supplement I moved the birds to a pin which has fine sand as the bedding (instead the wood savings) in hopes that it would reduce bacterial growth in the pin and hence potentially stop the spread of this potential disease, and I also took them to a room with better ventilation in hopes this is some type of air quality issue.\n\nSo what should I do now since I already give them the supplement, but it doesn't seem to work (the ones which already have wry neck doesn't seem to get better, even though their condition isn't worsening either) and birds are catching the wry neck even while on the supplement?\n\nAlso, should I just end the birds with the wry neck so that they can't spread it to other birds if it indeed is a disease of some kind? I'm pretty out of ideas at this point, so all input is much appreciated.\n\nHere are some images of them:\n\n[Their current setup](https://preview.redd.it/6uyuhww1ycdd1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3c03c096b327c606074d03e5a257a9a649e42e8)\n\n[One of the wry neck cases](https://preview.redd.it/zbcce3m4ycdd1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2b03afbae9847a5f062379f1d2aca7f62e0dcd2)",

But we had one (chicken) chick get wry neck, separated her and switched her to non medicated right away plus a soluble supplement for the water (we used rooster booster) and it did go away over the course of maybe a week.

On most days I just estimste how much is 50ml. \n\nRemember to top up the water to the mark in a measrung cup because the vitamin powder will slightly displsce some water volume (as opposed to measuring everything beforehand & mixing it after) \n\nIf you're worried about the amount of liquid, you can cut the amount of water to half (525ml/25mg per dose) or a quarter(262.5ml/12.5ml per dose (don't have to be very precise)). \n\nShake mixture well every time before you pour some of it. \n\nI make weekly dosages in powder form for several months in advance.

    "body": "After a 3 year hiatus, I've decided to start making my own skincare products again.\n\nI wanted to start of with a moisturizer that mainly focuses on sun damage repair/protection and locking in moisture (I currently live in a very sunny place and the tap water really dries out my skin lol).\n\nBut I'm having trouble developing a recipe.\n\nMostly, because I now have like 5 ingredients that could help with dry/irritated skin ( ectoin, pentavitin, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, allantoin)  and I just can't figure out if adding all of them would be overkill or if it would have an adverse effect. Or maybe it's the best idea ever.\n\nSo I was wondering how many actives would you say is enough per formula? Because these were just the \"moisturizing\" actives. There's still a handful more for the sun damage part. \n\nWhich then also made me wonder... how do *you* approach formulating? \n\nE.g.  \nDo you just mix the cream you had planned with all of the ingredients and hope it's what you wanted? \n\nThis is what I mostly did in the past, because everything was new and I had to try it all asap... but I now realize this way you won't easily be able to detect problematic ingredients.\n\nOr do you formulate in phases and just take your sweet time? \n\nAs in, first the bare basics ( just your base oils, water, (co-)emulsifier and preservative), see how you like it for a few weeks and adjust until it's perfect. Then build onto that base recipe by adding 1-2 new (active) ingredients, testing it for a few weeks. Rinse and repeat.  \nThis way feels like it'd take years to get to a good formula...unless you're able to make tiny 5-10g batches.  \n\n\nFor anyone who's interested, here's a draft of what I have in mind for the final version. There will still be lots of re-shuffeling/eliminating of ingredients and percentages though :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|*Water*|%100-(rest of ingredients)|distilled water|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||||\n|Oils|5%|raspberry seed oil|\n||5%|pomegranate seed oil|\n||2%|squalan|\n||8%|caprylic triglyceride|\n||||\n|(co-)Emulsifiers|3.5%|Montanov 68|\n||1.5%|Cetyl Alcohol|\n||||\n|Stabilizer|?%|xanthan gum|\n||||\n|Actives|2.5%|gamma oryzanol|\n||2%|Sodium PCA|\n||2%|Niacinamide|\n||2%|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n||1.5%|Pentavitin|\n||1%|D-panthenol|\n||1%|Vitamin E|\n||0.5%|Ectoin|\n||0.5%|Koffein|\n||0.1%|Hyaluronic acid low|\n||0.1%|Hyaluronic acid high|\n||0.1%|Allantoin|\n||||\n|Preservatives|parabeen K\\* or Germaben ii|\"5 drops for 50g\" or 0.5-1%|\n|potential pH Modifier|?|?|\n\n\\*For some reason Parabeen K doesn't do percentages, only drops... but it's one of the few blends I can get over here that contains parabens.\n\n***Discaimer***\\*: I'm really rusty regarding oil/water/heated/cool down phases, so I still need to figure out which ingredients go where, hence just a general list of ingredients for now.",

After 5 days, 47% of the patients were cured under the combined treatment compared with only 1% under xylometazoline monotherapy. These data show that the addition of dexpanthenol to an alpha-sympathomimetic nasal spray not only improves its tolerability but also further increases its effectiveness and leads to expedited cure.\n\n-----\n\n[**Effect on the nasal mucosa of long-term treatment with oxymetazoline, benzalkonium chloride, and placebo nasal sprays**](https://doi.org/10.1097/00005537-199605000-00016) (paywalled, use scihub)\n> After 28 days of use, benzalkonium chloride spray alone induced an increase in nasal mucosal swelling. At the end of the month, the score for nasal stuffiness was significantly higher for the group treated with oxymetazoline than for those treated with benzalkonium chloride. Oxymetazoline nasal spray induced a pronounced increase in nasal reactivity, which was significantly greater than that induced in the placebo group. Long-term use of placebo and benzalkonium chloride nasal sprays also caused an increase in nasal reactivity, but not to the same extent as with the nasal sprays containing oxymetazoline. The authors concluded that long-term use of oxymetazoline induces a sensation of nasal stuffiness, which may be due to unconscious exaggeration of the degree of nasal stuffiness, induced nasal hyperreactivity, or a combination of both.",

Before that i was just using a sulphate shampoo and no conditioner (Yes i know it was really bad). As for the products i currently use: Dr. Organic Aloe Vera shampoo & conditioner (Ingredients down below) both of the products contain no protein.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nI did the stretch test and my hair stretches too much. I read this is a sign of too much moisture and not enough protein. \n\nMy conditioner and shampoo contains no protein. I was not purposely looking for a protein free conditioner and shampoo but it is just difficult to find conditioners with no silicones in Belgium.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nBecause it is not easy to find conditioners with protein and no silicones i will probably use a DIY gelatine treatment or i also read on the science-y hair blog that you could use beer as protein treatment. Which sounds very intriguing. \n\n**Question:**\n\nNow for preventing over moisturised hair in the future because it happend relatively shortly 2-3 weeks of using protein free conditioner and i have over moisturised hair. Could it be that my conditioner and shampoo are too strong? Or that they just contain no protein? Or that i am now using a conditioner which before i didn’t use.\n\nAlso how bad is it to have over moisturized hair? Because i am currently not at home and cant do these protein treatments and i hope it doesn’t damage my hair too much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading this and i hope someone will be able to help me :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients shampoo and conditioner:**\n\nDr. Organic Aloe Vera shampoo:\n\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice, Aqua (water), Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Sodium\n\ncocoamphoacetate, Cocamidopropyl betaine, Palmitamidopropyltrimonium chloride, Coco-glucoside, Glyceryl oleate, Sorbitan sesquicaprylate, Sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, Parfum\\*, Limonene, Linalool, Citric acid. \\*Natural and food grade.\n\nDr. Organic Aloe Vera conditioner:\n\nAloe barbadensis leaf juice, Aqua, Polyglyceryl-3 methylglucose distearate, Cetearyl alcohol, Glycerin, Pyrus malus (Apple) fruit extract, Butyrospermum parkii (Shea) butter, Glyceryl caprylate, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Tocopherol, Helianthus annuus (Sunflower) seed oil, Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, Parfum, Citric acid, Sodium phytate, Sodium benzoate, Potassium sorbate, Limonene, Linalool.",

    "body": "Hey everyone! So yesterday I stopped over CVS and picked up Stridex in the red box. I want to try using it tonight but I am still confused/torn about what cleanser moisturizer to use with it! Here is my problem: I have been using random moisturizers I had at home almost everyday in the morning for the past week because I ordered Simple ultra-light hydrating gel moisturizer because I LOVED Clinique DDMG and was looking for a dupe (Plus CLinique DDMG has comedogenic ingredients and is not hydrating enough sometimes). It's arriving in the mail today. I had been trying to use Cetaphil moisturizing lotion some days but I feel there's something in there that makes my skin feel itchy/hot. Or my skin is already irritated from all the clenaser/moisturizer switches and I'm just trying to convince myself I react badly to fatty alcohols but I don't know for sure? Cleanser: I also recently ordered the Simple Refreshing facial gel wash and it arrived in the mail a few days ago so I have been using it, and it's supposed to be for sensitive skin but I can't tell if that is what is irritating my skin? It has cocomydropyl betaine as its cleansing agent and I thought it would be good because I thought I don't react well to SLS, but now I'm not so sure :/\n\nMy original plan was to use the Simple refreshing gel wash, stridex at night, and then simple gel moisturizer. In the morning, use face wash if I want to or not, apply gel moisturizer and then make up. Now I don't know because I feel like there's something in simple products that irritates my skin, but I could be wrong because I've been switching things so frequently. Ugh so confused! Their simple micellar water did irritate me, but I checked cosdna and it showed irritating ingredients in it so it may just not be the brand/just particular product? I'm wondering if it's the \"provitamin b5\" they put in all of their products but I could be wrong and it seems pretty harmless.\n\nNow I'm thinking to: Stop over at CVS again and pick up Cerave foaming face wash and \"cerave in the tub\". They actually had small tubes of the cerave cream at CVS so I wouldn't have to buy the whole tub! I've used cerave foaming in the past with no problems. I'm just worried about the cerave cream because I don't think my skin particularly likes Cetaphil lotion either because of the fatty alcohols/or macadamia seed oil and I'm afraid I will have a similar reaction to the cerave cream. :/\n\nPLEASE HELP ='(\n",

It was not a good idea lol Also, patch test the products, see if just the area you put it on reacts that way. I think the recommended adding products time is like.. 3 weeks? I could be wrong, don't hold me to that. But that being said, definitely just start with a cleanser, then slowly add in the new products. If they do irritate/cause a breakout, you'll know exactly what's causing it. Good luck!",

        "body": "I'm going to assume the cleanser doesn't leave you with a film of oil on your face, so it should be just fine. Especially since you're using a toner afterward. You're definitely fine using moisturizers/oils after your AHA has had time to do its thing (20 minutes).\n\nHave you ever considered using the BHA before the aha? I've read on here that that makes the aha more effective, as the bha can get through the oil and down into your pores.",

    "body": "Hi! Today I am getting about a foot chopped off of my hair and beginning the process of healing and appreciating my natural curly texture! I know curls are fragile and there are tips like for sleep you should use a silk wrap, for putting it up you should use a gentle scrunchie or clip it, but what about when you go to the gym? \n\nI workout 4-5 times/week and also play soccer, and I am concerned not only about how to hold my hair so it stays out of my face during these activities without damaging the curls, but also what that activity/sweat level is going to mean for my washing process. \n\nAny tips and advice is appreciated! \n\n(Don't know if this info will be useful to answer this post but here are my hair details atm: my hair right now is a little longer than waist length and I intend to get it cut around my shoulders, possibly with bangs. The current ends are bleached and dyed but that will be getting cut off. I have been using the Balance bar shampoo and conditioner from packagefreeshop for many months now, although I occasionally use my boyfriends Head & Shoulders and a Living Proof brand of deep conditioner. With my hair at its current length my hair is more wavy than anything, but when it has been short in the past it is definitely curly but very frizzy because I never bothered to use any products on it at all and let it air dry. From the hair type assessments I have taken, it seems as though my hair may fall into the 3A-C category, but will hopefully get a more definitive answer once its cut!) \n\nPS- these are the listed ingredients for the shampoo bar I use per the website: Sodium coco sulfate, coconut oil, cocoa butter, jojoba oil, calendula, shea oil, hemp seed oil, apricot seed oil, (essential oils of: sweet orange, neroli, and palmarosa), d-panthenol, turmeric, and hydrolyzed quinoa protein.",

        "body": "So I workout a lot too :) couple things\n\nFor the workout \n- tie your hair up with cloth or silk hair ties none of the elastic normal hair ties. That shit tears out your hair. Don’t tug your hair too much a really tight pony also hurts your hair. I like to try and have my curls survive after a workout when I put it down so I keep it pretty loosely tied and it’s fine for me but, you run a lot in soccer so maybe you can’t be so loose. That’s why cloth hair ties are so great it’s less damaging \n- I wear my hair in a loose pineapple bun or pony :) or braids help.\n- with bangs you may want some cloth headbands or get some hair pins or clips to braid or pull back your bangs from your face\n- when you get your hair cut be sure to tell them that once it shrinks back dry it needs to be long enough for you to tie it up \n\nPost workout - when I gotta rush\n- I take a body shower after I sweat and keep my hair up and basically let the steam dampen my hair. If I need more damp I use a spray bottle with water and spritz it a bit. \n- I put gel in with water in my spray bottle so it acts like a gel spray. but you can also use the prayer hands method and kinda run some product thru semi damp hair too. I take a travel size gel with me in my gym bag lol\n- Voila curls are a bit more fresh without having to totally redo your hair!\n\nPost workout - when I have more time to get ready or I sweat a lot\n- so I wash my hair more than most on this sub do.. Caveat: My hair isn’t really dry, it’s  really healthy. So sometimes I wash my hair like 3-4x a week due to workouts  but what I use to wash is different\n- once a week is my “hair reset” wash I do, with my full shampoo and conditioner routine, trying to clarify my scalp from product buildup etc\n- the rest of the week if it’s just to feel clean after a heavy workout I use strictly cowash. It helps me get rid of that itchy scalp from dried sweat and I can detangle my hair a bit (it always tangles when I put it up). But not as stripping to my hair as the full shampoo and conditioner.\n- I like Curlsmith cowash for most of the week. For the reset wash I rotate using Devacurl no-poo and a Curlsmith deep condish OR Olaplex products because I bleached my hair.\n\n\nWish I could tell you about brushes but I have no need to use one… I only ever brush and detangle with my fingers or mayyyybe a wide tooth comb in the shower.",

    "body": "For years, retinoids have been praised as the ultimate solution for acne and anti-aging. But for some, these potent ingredients can do more harm than good—causing irritation, redness, and even worsening acne. If your skin tends to revolt at the mention of retinoids, you’re not alone. The beauty of Korean skincare lies in its innovative, gentle approach to achieving calm, healthy, and youthful skin. Let's explore the soothing alternatives it has to offer.\n\n# Why Shift Away From Retinoids?\n\nRetinoids work wonders for some by increasing cell turnover, smoothing fine lines, and combating acne. However, their potency comes at a cost for sensitive or reactive skin. Stripping essential moisture, disrupting the skin's barrier, or over-exfoliating can leave skin inflamed and uncomfortable. Korean skincare, on the other hand, focuses on nourishing the skin and repairing it naturally—without harsh chemicals or irritation.\n\n# Key Ingredients That Shine Without the Burn\n\n1. **Centella Asiatica**\n   * Known as \"cica,\" this ingredient is packed with antioxidants and amino acids. It heals skin, reduces inflammation, and calms redness. Perfect for both active breakouts and recovering skin.\n2. **Snail Mucin**\n   * A powerhouse multitasker, snail mucin hydrates, repairs, and promotes collagen production. It’s lightweight yet effective, leaving skin smooth and supple.\n3. **Propolis**\n   * Derived from bees, propolis is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. It soothes current breakouts while adding moisture and a natural glow to the skin.\n4. **Panthenol (Provitamin B5)**\n   * Known for its deeply hydrating properties, panthenol locks in moisture while soothing irritation, making it a great addition to sensitive skin routines.\n5. **Mugwort**\n   * A traditional herbal ingredient with anti-inflammatory properties, mugwort balances and calms irritated skin while boosting resilience.\n\n# Curated Routine with Korean Alternatives\n\n# Morning Routine\n\n1. **Cleanser:** *Round Lab Dokdo Cleanser* – Gentle and hydrating, this leaves skin refreshed without feeling stripped.\n2. **Toner:** *Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner* – Boosts hydration and preps the skin for the rest of your products.\n3. **Serum:** *iUNIK Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum* – Brightens and soothes breakouts while keeping skin moisturized.\n4. **Moisturizer:** *Etude House Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream* – A lightweight yet hydrating cream that strengthens the skin’s barrier.\n5. **Sunscreen:** *Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF 50* – A soothing, non-greasy sunscreen infused with rice and probiotics.\n\n# Nighttime Routine\n\n1. **Double Cleanse:** Start with *Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm*, followed by a low-pH foaming cleanser like *Etude House Soon Jung Cleanser*.\n2. **Essence or Serum:** Apply a layer of *COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence* for hydration and repair.\n3. **Treatment:** Use a calming treatment like *COSRX Centella Blemish Cream* to focus on troubled spots.\n4. **Moisturize:** Seal everything in with *I'm From Mugwort Cream*, which deeply hydrates while reducing redness.\n\n# Product Comparison Table\n\n|**Ingredient**|**Skin Concern Addressed**|**Example Product**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Centella Asiatica|Redness, inflammation, healing skin|COSRX Centella Blemish Cream|\n|Snail Mucin|Hydration, repair, anti-aging|COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Power Essence|\n|Propolis|Acne-prone, dull, sensitive skin|iUNIK Propolis Vitamin Synergy Serum|\n|Panthenol|Irritated, dry, or sensitive skin|Etude House Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream|\n|Mugwort|Calming, breakout-prone skin|I'm From Mugwort Essence|\n\n# Q&A Section\n\n# Can Korean alternatives deliver the same anti-aging benefits as retinoids?\n\nAbsolutely! While gentler, ingredients like snail mucin and propolis support collagen production, repair damage, and boost skin elasticity, delivering long-term benefits with none of the irritation.\n\n# How long until I see results?\n\nGentle ingredients usually show noticeable improvements within 2-4 weeks. For deeper issues like acne scars or fine lines, consistent usage over 2-3 months is key.\n\n# Can I combine these alternatives with exfoliants?\n\nYes! However, start slow. Gentle exfoliants like PHAs or lactobionic acid pair well with soothing ingredients to refine skin without overloading it.\n\n# Are these products safe for acne-prone skin?\n\nMost Korean formulations prioritize lightweight, non-comedogenic textures that won’t clog your pores, making them ideal for acne-prone types.\n\n# Image Suggestions\n\n1. A tidy skincare shelf featuring Korean products like serums, toners, and essences, styled in soft lighting.\n2. A close-up shot of snail mucin texture on a spoon—highlighting its unique consistency.\n3. A cozy nighttime routine setup with candles, skincare jars, and a relaxed aesthetic.\n\n# And Finally...\n\nRetinoids may be the gold standard for some, but they’re not the only path to clear, youthful-looking skin. Korean skincare offers gentle alternatives that support your skin’s health without irritation. By focusing on hydration and calming ingredients like centella asiatica, snail mucin, and propolis, you can nurture your skin back to balance. Remember, skincare is not one-size-fits-all—sometimes the softer approach is what your skin truly needs.\n\n# Got questions about Korean skincare? Want the latest tips, trends, and K-beauty coupons?
