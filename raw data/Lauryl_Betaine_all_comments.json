    "body": "I have been a long time devoted user of the Round Lab Mugwort Calming Cleanser, and would consider it my HG. I can't even remember how many tubes of it I've gone through. Recently I've noticed that it's started going up in price (last time I bought it I had to pay $26 CAD), and it's become increasingly hard to justify that price for a cleanser. So when I saw this Bring Green Artemisia pH Balancing Foam at my local kbeauty shop for $13.99 CAD I had to try it!\n\n\nSkin type: combination, dehydrated, acne and clog prone\n\n\nRound Lab Ingredients:\n\nWater, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Butylene Glycol, Coco-Betaine, Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Vulgaris Extract, Aspartic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl Glycol, Polyquaternium-67, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, 1,2- Hexanediol, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Allantoin, Madecassoside, Panthenol, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid\n\n\nBring Green Ingredients:\n\nGlycerin, Purified Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Lauryl Betaine, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Artemisia Capillaris Extract (8,000ppm), Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Malt Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Lavender Oil, Citrus Nobilis (Mandarin Orange) Peel Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Orange Peel Oil, Polyquaternium-39, Artemisia Princeps Leaf Powder (800ppm), Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Linalool, Limonene \n\n\nBoth cleansers claim to be pH balanced at 5.5 and gentle on the skin. That I will say is true, I never had irritation using the Round Lab, and in the 4 times I've used the Bring Green I didn't either. They both leave my skin feeing properly cleansed without being stripped or dry. \n\n\nTexture wise I prefer the Round Lab. It has a slightly thicker texture which foams up to a nice rich foam. However at times it can take a little extra effort to rinse away. The Bring Green does foam up just as well, but it isn't as rich of a foam. It contains very tiny visible bits of mugwort, but they're so small you don't feel them. It also rinses away much cleaner and faster. \n\n\nIn terms of scent the Round Lab doesn't really have one, it smells very faintly of mugwort. The Bring Green however has a light citrus scent due to the essential oils, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't linger once rinsed. \n\n\nOverall I think I might end up switching to the Bring Green. Although the user experience might not be as pleasant as when using the Round Lab, for almost half the price it's definitely worth keeping in my routine.",

    "body": "Hello! So beplain initially caught my attention as I’ve heard the brand was made based on customer feedback in Korea. The ingredients list for these products are relatively simple so there was little worry for breakouts. It definitely did not disappoint!\n\nA little background: I live in a humid country with dehydrated, combination, acne-prone skin. My main concerns with my skin right now is CCs, calming and hydrating.\n\n-\n**Greenful pH-Balanced Cleansing Foam** ***4.5/5 MRP***\n\n*Glycerin, Mung Bean Extract, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Lauryl Betaine, Betaine, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Melia Azadirachta Leaf Extract, Melia Azadirachta Flower Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Extract, Coccinia Indica Fruit Extract, Solanum Melongena (Eggplant) Fruit Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Ocimum Sanctum Leaf Extract, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Corallina Officinalis Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phaseolus Radiatus Seed Powder, Dextrin, Allantoin, Water, Ceramide NP, Green Tea Powder, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nCompared to all cleansers I’ve used so far, this was probably one of the best. It’s a pretty light green with a thick paste texture, and has small bits of what seems to be mung bean. In my opinion, you can smell mung bean, just slightly, but I didn’t mind it at all as it reminds me of those asian dessert places haha. The cleanser itself foams, but for me it wasn’t stripping at all. The cleanser contains lots of extracts which could be good for the skin, but honestly since it’s a wash-off product, I couldnt feel any of the benefits :”) The downside would be the price. In my country, it is sold for $12 for 80ml, which is more expensive than any other cleansers I’ve ever used :(\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Toner** ***3.5/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract (80.65%), Propanediol, Methylpropanediol, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Trehalose, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Allantoin, Cellulose Gum, Disodium EDTA, Ceramide-NP, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin*\n\nOkay so this was a 3.5 for me, just because of my skin type and the weather in my country. For oily-combo skin in humid weather, this toner felt slightly too moisturizing, so it felt kind of heavy for me. This would definitely be amazing for dry skin in the summer or oily skin in the winter. It’s a runny toner with a slight slip if you rub it against your hands. I could smell a bit of the chamomile as I apply it to my face but it wasn’t overpowering at all. It was soothing, but the main thing it did for my skin was honestly the moisturizing/hydrating component. If that was what you’re looking for in a runny toner, I’d definitely recommend this!\n\n-\n**Cicaful ampoule** ***4.5/5 WRP***\n\n*Centella Asiatica Extract (81.44%), Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Acrylate/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Hydroxyacetophenone*\n\nI understand you probably are sick with all the cica products dominating the market, but this ampoule was *really good* for me. This ampoule is clear and very viscous, almost like a gel but still relatively runny. As you rub it on your skin it becomes like water, and sinks in reaaally quick. I’ve heard people say this was hydrating for them, but it wasn’t *that* hydrating for me. The calming effect was *amazing* though—redness in my face can minimize as soon as a few hours after application. It felt cooling and very soothing to the skin. Though I would say I run out of the bottle relatively quicker than other serums haha. If you need a calming, no fuss ampoule with minimal ingredients and low breakout risk, this is definitely one to try out!\n\n-\n**Chamomile pH-Balanced Lotion** ***3/5 WNRP***\n\n*Chamomile Flower Extract, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Kelp Extract, Eclipta Prostrata Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Acmella Oleracea Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil, Purified Water, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Squalane (Plant-derived), Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Fructooligosaccharides, Beta-Glucan, Allantoin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide-NP, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Pentylene Glycol*\n\nCompared to other lotions/emulsions I’ve tried, I don’t think I prefer this one. This lotion was a bit thick and holds it’s shape better when you try making it run down. It has the chamomile smell similar to the toner, but far more minimal that you really can’t smell it unless you’re trying to. It’s very moisturizing, probably enough if you use this as a moisturizer in the summer. It spreads well and you don’t need a lot to cover your entire face, but it sinks in less quick, so after using it, it feels like you’ve put a legit cream moisturizer on your face. This was *not* a bad product, but it’s probably better geared towards those with dry skin.\n\n-\n**Hyaluronic Aqua Moisturizer** ***4/5 WRP***\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Methyl Trimethicone, Methylpropanediol, Panthenol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP, Copolymer, Raffinose, Betaine, Sodium Hyaluronate (100ppm), Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid (100ppm), Allantoin, Madecassoide, Beta-glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Ethylcellulose, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Isostearyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-51*\n\nRight off the bat, the texture surprised me. This came out as a translucent balm-like gel with no scent, like a less strong vaseline, so for those with dehydrated skin, this one is for you! I was kinda scared using it thinking it was going to be heavy, but I have been using it at night and it’s done wonders for my skin the next morning. Perhaps because my skin is dehydrated, but with this product, my skin texture really improved. As this also was not like a very emollient moisturizer, it felt like it was a layer sealing in all the serum and toner I used before and did not feel clogging at all. Honestly, this product turned out faaaaaar better than I expected!\n\n-\n\nOverall I am really impressed with the brand. None of their products broke me out, which is incredible! All in all I’d say I recommend the cleanser and the cica ampoule for all skin types, the chamomile line for dry skin types (or combo/oily in the winter) and the aqua moisturizer for dehydrated skin. I hope this review was helpful for you and have a great day!",

Angry zits calm down and get smaller a lot faster.\n\nThe chamomile toner is moisturizing just enough for my oily skin this winter, but I can see how it can feel heavy and too moisturizing in humid climates.

    "body": "Recently Sokoglam released a collaboration product with Neogen: [Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick] (https://sokoglam.com/products/neogen-real-fresh-cleansing-stick-green-tea). I was super excited to see this as cleansing sticks are my new jam after the sum37 Miracle Rose Cleansing Stick became my HG, however, what I didn't know what that Neogen already had a green tea cleansing stick on the market! And one in almost identical packaging. \n\nSay what? \n\nSokoglam's founder, Charlotte Cho gave a tip through the Klog,\n>you can tell that it’s the latest version of the cleansing stick if you see my signature on the side of the packaging and has pink-colored leaves!\n\n*However, I only see that the difference in the external packaging, not on the actual product itself.* Paper is cheap, so of course, I then had to look into the ingredients to see if there actually was a difference.\n\nDue to the identical name of the products, it was a little annoying looking at the SEO results. However, I was able to find a review on the blog Beauty Versus Zombies that had a breakdown of ingredients as well.\n\nBeauty Versus Zombies published the [post on Aug 26 2016] (http://beautyversuszombies.com/everything-stick-cleansing-stick/), without a mention of the Neogen green tea stick cleanser as a collaborative product. Sokoglam introduced their version Dec 12 2016 on [the Klog] (http://theklog.co/green-tea-cleansing-stick-next-level/) and their official [Instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/p/BN8EaNVlzGk/?taken-by=sokoglam&hl=en), so I was able to safety differentiate that Beauty Versus Zombies had the original Neogen version.\n\nHere's the ingredient list for the original Neogen version (credits to Beauty Versus Zombies)\n>Glycerin, purified water, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, lauryl betaine, betaine, camellia sinensis leaf (3%), camellia japonica seed oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, oenothera biennis (evening primrose) oil, tocopheryl acetate, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil, ocimum basillicum (basil) oil, cananga odorata flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, origanum heracleoticum flower oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, fragrance\n\nnow here's the ingredient list for the Sokoglam x Neogen version that I pulled from Sokoglam's website:\n>Glycerin, purified water, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, palmitic acid, stearic acid, lauryl betaine, betaine, camellia sinensis leaf(0.3%), **camellia sinensis seed oil(0.1%)**, camellia japonica seed oil, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower)seed oil, **limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil**, oenothera biennis (eveningprimrose) oil, tocopheryl acetate, citrus aurantifolia (lime) oil, ocimum basillicum (basil) oil, cananga odorata flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, origanum heracleoticum floweroil, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange)peel oil, fragrance\n\nAside from two bolded ingredients, everything else was the same. The Sokoglam version had added camellia sinensis seed oil (0.1%) and limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil. Of course, it should be noted that even with the same ingredients, maybe the concentration of ingredients was changed in the Sokoglam formula, but who can really tell just by looking at the ingredient list?\n\n\nI'm also not familiar with these two ingredients. Hence, the title of this post includes the term \"curious\" --- I'm curious if people have tried the Neogen original one and/or the Sokoglam version. I would love to hear your opinions on them, specifically if you think there's a major difference. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be that much of a retail price difference $20-$22 between the products as well.\n\n\nI was planning on buying the Sokoglam version to test it myself, but sadly it seems to be sold out right now. So I would love to hear your feedback!\n\n**EDIT 12/21/16** It has been kindly pointed out to me that the two are actually the same product! Charlotte Cho actually collaborated with Neogen for the Korean launch (without her name on it), but for the US launch Sokoglam was included in the credits. Ingredient list is also the same due to an error in translation.\n\n**EDIT 12/23/16 reply from Sokoglam** \n>Charlotte created both Neogen Cleansing Sticks, but there is a more updated version now after making iterations to the first version. The most recent version has her name on the packaging. *If you compare the list of ingredients, they are the same only because she changed the percentages (levels) of the ingredients slightly so there wasn’t movement on the ingredient list. She also changed the fragrance from the original, which is the biggest difference from the first version to the second.*\n\nThen I followed up with a question on the fragrance and received this answer:\n>The Neogen Cleansing Stick has always been Green Tea with its natural green tea leave extracts, however the fragrance itself did not reflect this in the first version, something a lot of people noted about the original version.\n\n**CONCLUSION 12/27/16** The two products are slightly different after all!",

It's pretty much completely eliminated my flakes. They have a face cream I also need and use for my hairline which is a bit more stubborn, but it helps. The itchiness isn't soothed that much but I now feel a healthy scalp. Doctor had recommended sebiprox before, which did absolutely nothing for me. Oh and I do use it more than recommended. Recommended is 3x/week for 2 weeks in \"attack phase\". Mine is 3-4x a week continuously.\n\nFor info I'm female, boob-length latina hair, 30 y/o, sebderm on head only, and for 10 years at least. I had dandruff as a kid but for most of my teenage years Head & Shoulders did the trick. Until I wanted to go organic: I tried an organic shampoo that brought on the sebderm in full rage, tried going back to H&S but it wouldn't work anymore for some reason. Now 3 years happy with Kelual DS.\n\nIngredients:\n\nWATER (AQUA). SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE. DECYL GLUCOSIDE. UNDECYLENAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE. **CICLOPIROX OLAMINE**. LACTAMIDE MEA. LAURYL BETAINE.

It's a lot less stripping than Cetaphil but my face still feels dry after using it. The problem is that I'm not sure which of the ingredients is responsible for this. I ran the ingredients through cosdna and everything was fine, but this product is 10/10 drying my skin. For what it's worth, it lathers up pretty well (like hand soap, but not on Asian foaming cleanser level). Prior to this, I tried the pump version of Hada Labo Gokyujun foaming cleanser and that dried me out too - more so than QV but less so than Cetaphil. I've ordered Cerave Hydrating but I'm still waiting on that sooo yeah. I just want to know what's responsible for my dry skin :( \n\nHere's an ingredient list:\nAqua (Water), Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Lauryl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Acrylates/ C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Aminomethyl Propanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.",

Every single (after trying like literally 100) cleanser or shampoo, or moisturizer or other products for that matter seems to irritate and cause my skin a reaction. I tried no poo and I would say it’s not for me, even chickpea flour gave me an allergic reaction and other methods left it too dirty. However the QV I miraculously tolerate. However I’ve noticed in my hair what feels like a chalky sticky residue , I was wondering what in it could do that? Perhaps it’s ph is too high and I should add some ACV or lemon juice to my hair after, or is there something in it that could stick to it and not wash out?
