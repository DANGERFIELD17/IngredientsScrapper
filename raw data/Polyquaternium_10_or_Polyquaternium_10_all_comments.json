    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>“I live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I’m 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.”\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don’t object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a “true” hydroxy acid — it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned “rules” of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don’t think there’s any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn’t the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis — at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. “PCA SKIN” also has another product with AzA called “ACNE GEL”. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the “pigment bar” it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There’s also “*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*” you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion”\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There’s 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description’s wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low — meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

        "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to write this up and the thought and effort behind it. I will say though that there is one part you should seriously consider editing:\n\n\"Do not use hydroxy acids with retinoids/retinol/Retin-A/Accutane or Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) products. Speaking from personal experience, this is way too much irritation to most people's skin. It can create more breakouts, redness, and inflammation, which is what you're typically trying to fix with these topicals.\"\n\nThis is very incorrect. While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster. You can say be careful using acids, but speaking so definitively about something that is completely not true and unfounded (especially about it somehow causing more breakouts) is something that needs to be editing or removed.",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- “Cosmeceutical”\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications.

We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**\n\nQuoting the product's description:\n> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.\n\nAnd according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)\n\nHas SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**\n\nHas two variants: \n\n- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin\n\n- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)\n> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin\n\nThe cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**\n\n- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*\n\n> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.3.\n\n- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*\n\n> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.\n\nIt has a pH level of 5.4.\n\nPersonal thoughts: The \"whitens your skin in just 7 days\" seems bogus. You can't just \"whiten\" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**\n\n> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you\n\nAlso pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**\n\n> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.\n\nAccording to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**\n\n> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.\n\nThis one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. \n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)\n\nIf you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**ON MOISTURIZERS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "[Shelfie](https://imgur.com/a/oLge8Bq.jpg)\n\nHairType: 1A/1B leaning towards 1A. Fine hair, High Porosity, Waist length. Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

    "body": "Hi all!  \n\n\nI am back with another skin conditions post. This one is on perioral dermatitis.   \n\n\nAdmittedly, when I began researching this, I knew zilch about PD except that it was acne-like breakouts around the mouth,  and as I began to research it, it seems that there isn't a whole lot that is known about it. Fortunately, it is a highly treatable condition that seems to overlap to a degree with rosacea (earning it the earlier name  of \"steroid rosacea\") and even seborrheic dermatitis.  \n\n\n**As always, please feel free to correct or inform me of anything wrong, and also feel free to post/discuss what helps your PD.**\n\n# What is Perioral Dermatitis\n\nPerioral dermatitis (PD) is a chronic, recurrant inflammatory disease that most commonly occurs in the perioral region of the face (the area around the mouth). It can also affect the area around the nose, and in roughly 20&#37; of cases, it can manifest around the eyes (though it goes by another name if around the eyes: peri-orificial dermatitis).   \n\n\nIt afflicts around 1&#37; of the population of the United States, particularly those with fair skin, and predominately occurs in women between 18-45, with 20s and 30s having peak incidence.   \n\n\nIt presents as small, red, tender, sometimes itchy bumps that can flake and burn. While commonly mistaken for acne, it is distinct from acne in that it only presents in specific locations, spares the small area around the lips, and lacks pustules (whiteheads).\n\n# Causes of Perioral Dermatitis\n\nThe causes of perioral dermatitis are unclear. It is a relatively \"young\" disease that was only first described as a distinct condition in 1964. It is first and foremost an inflammatory condition, and is aggravated by ingredients and habits that can create inflammation either in the skin or in the body. \n\nWhile I was researching PD, the one constant that showed up again and again is that it is aggravated by corticosteroid use -- both topical and inhaled. To specify, that means not just creams like kenalog, triamcinolone, and over-the-counter hydrocortisone, but also asthma inhalers (including Advair, Flovent, and ProAir aka Albuterol) and nasal allergy mists like Beconase, Flonase, Nasonex, Omnaris, and Veramyst. \n\nLess commonly, but still a factor to consider are hormones, where monthly shifts can put the condition into overdrive. More frustrating is that oral contraceptives can worsen PD in some. \n\nOther causes can be fluoridated toothpaste, high SPF value sunscreens¹, sunscreens with the filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, the ingredient \"isopropyl myristate,\" improperly removing makeup or sleeping in makeup, occlusive ointments (Vaseline, Aquaphor, and oils, for example), heavy creams with occlusive ingredients, and cold creams (wipe-off cleansing creams that leave a residue, like Pond's). In one case, a woman's favorite lip balm (containing the ingredient propyl gallate) caused her PD.⁶\n\n# Treatment\n\nPD can look like many other conditions, such as acne, angular cheilitis, rosacea, or seborrheic dermatitis, and requires treatment of a professional due to the inflammatory nature of the condition. \n\nThe most important thing for anyone suffering from PD is to discontinue steroid use - whether cold-turkey or weened off with the management of a healthcare professional. While topical steroids can seem to improve the condition, they frequently create a rebound effect, which can make the condition worse. \n\nOnce steroids are removed, the skin will get worse before getting better. This is the toughest part of PD for most people. Topical antibiotics or topical immunosuppresants (such as Pimecrolimus or Elidel) are frequently prescribed due to their tremendously  helpful anti-inflammatory effects on PD, and azelaic acid can prove useful in some cases. In very severe cases, oral antibiotics can be prescribed in addition to topicals. \n\nWhile healing from PD, the skin should not be cleansed with any cleanser, and makeup and skincare products should be avoided completely until the condition resolves. And no matter how tempting, PD should never be scrubbed, as this worsens the inflammation. \n\nOnce treated, it is encouraged to use liquid or gel sunscreens as well as soap-free cleansers that do not dry out the skin, as TEWL (trans-epidermal water loss) is significant in people who suffer from PD.\n\n# Long-Term Care\n\nSome people have PD once in their lives, while others may combat it on and off for several years. If you fall into the latter, it is important to try to avoid triggers that can cause the condition to reoccur (particularly steroid use). That means cleansing your skin each day with gentle cleansers, always removing makeup (removing it with a wipe does *NOT* count - you need to cleanse it away thoroughly with an oil cleanser that rinses cleanly), and using light products, particularly around the areas typically affected. \n\nPrescriptions like azelaic acid and over-the-counter .1&#37; adapalene (Differin)² may  also help to manage the condition in the long-term. \n\nI've put together a list below of some cleansers and moisturizers that are recommended for people suffering from PD. Again, like with my rosacea list, this is not a be-all-end-all list. None of the products listed contain isopropyl myristate or heavy occlusive ingredients.\n\n## Recommended Products\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser** \n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Stearyl Alcohol and Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Face Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate​,​ Polysorbate 60​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Panthenol​,​ T-Butyl Alcohol,​ Tocopherol​.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Wate/Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryl Glycol/Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.*\n\n**Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: *Avene Thermal Spring Water (avene Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Serine, Cetrimonium Bromide, Coco-Glucoside, Dipotassium Phosphate, Disodium Edta, Disodium Phosphate, O-Phenylphenol, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Water (Aqua).*\n\n**Spectro Jel Cleanser for Blemish-Prone Skin - Fragrance Free**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Hydroxypropyl Methocellulose, Polysorbate 20, Cetyl Alcohol (moisturizer), Hydrated Silica, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Diazolidinyl Urea, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sorbitan Oleate.*\n\n## Foaming Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Terastearate, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric, Glycerides, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Sodium Chloride, Phytosphingosine, Citric Acid, Edetate Disodium, Dihydrate, Sodium, Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**Olay Foaming Face Wash Sensitive**\n\n>*Ingredients: Water/Eau, Glycerin, Sodium Myristoyl Sarcosinate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Laureth-10, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, DMDM Hydantoin.*\n\n**La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Cleanser**\n\n>*Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau (La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water),​ Glycerin​,​ Coco-Betaine​,​ Propylene Glycol​,​ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate​,​ PEG-120 Methyl Glucoside Dioleate,​ Sodium Chloride​,​ Ceramide NP​,​ Niacinamide​,​ Sodium Hydroxide​,​ Disodium EDTA​,​ Capryloyl Glycine​,​ Caprylyl Glycol​,​ Citric Acid​,​ Acrylates Copolymer​.*\n\n## Makeup Removers\n\n**Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm**\n\n>*Ingredients: Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Sorbeth-30 Tetraoleate, Polyethylene, PEG-5 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Water / Aqua / Eau, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol.*\n\n**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil**\n\n>*Ingredients: Mineral Oil, PEG-8 Glyceryl Isostearate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Cyclomethicone, Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Isostearic Acid, Glycerin, Phenoexyethanol.*\n\n## Moisturizers\n\n**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Ceteareth-20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Cholesterol, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.*\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3-Diisosterate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium phosphate, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Polysorbate 20, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum.*\n\n**CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>*Ingredients: Active - Dimethicone, 1\\%.

        "body": "I’ve been diagnosed with Peri-orbital Dermatitis by my dermatologist. I’ve had it for at least 10 years. Peri-orbital means it presents around my eyes, nose and mouth. My worst flare ups cover all three areas, my most frequent flare ups present just around my nostrils. \n\nYes, you’re correct that causes are basically unknown. Successful treatments can vary wildly. \n\n(personally, I’m convinced it has a fungal element, specially related to candida imbalance. That’s just my opinion. I have used OTC topicalS and been prescribed anti-fungal topicals and pills, none of that worked. I believe it is related to gut microbiome health. Our skin is a direct reflection of what’s going on intrinsically in our bodies) \n\nI want chime in here about Zinc Oxide. You mention it as a possible cause. I want others out here to know that high concentration Zinc Oxide Cream is the ONLY thing that stops my flare ups. So if you have PD, I recommend patch testing a high ZO cream on one or two of the papules and see if it helps you. Incidentally, I’ve found recently that micronized ZO particles actually work faster for my than larger particles. So I stopped using Desitin Max strength and started using Neutrogena Sheer Zinc for face with 22% ZO. It stops my flare ups completely in a matter of a day or so, versus 4+ days with the Desitin. \n\nI’ll list below everything I’ve tried in case it’s helpful. The other product I find helpful is daily probiotic pills containing Lactobacillus Acidophilus. I get less flare ups when I take daily probiotics. \n\nDIDN’T WORK: \nAntibacterial Rx creams, I believe I had both Erythromycin and Dapsone. OTC antifungal creams, clotrimazole, miconazole and terbinafine. I also had an oral Rx for Lamisil, it was generic and I can’t recall the generic name. OTC topical steroids, hydrocortisone. Violet extract. Cutting out SLS from from my toothpaste and hair products. (I never cleansed with SLS, always either soap or oil) Changing my diet to an acne safe diet. Getting sun. Staying out of sun. Sulphur washes. Leaving it alone.",

I was prescribed Finacea and in one month the results have been astounding. Redness has significantly reduced and no closed comedones or inflamed pimples anywhere. Again mine wasn’t severe but for anyone who has it I think azelaic acid is a great choice. \n\nI should point out I never use steroids, I’m 30F and I think this was due to over moisturizing after over exfoliating. I also think the occlusive nature of aquaphor made it much worse. My routine now consists of nothing but cleanser, moisturizer and Finacea. Drastic change from what I was doing before. \n\nThank you for taking the time to post this very informative breakdown of perioral dermatitis.",

Is it down to the pH of a product, a single ingredient, an interaction between two of more ingredients? 🤔\n\nHere's the ingredient list of a clear gloss by dpHUE:\n\n- Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-10, Triethanolamine, Parf􏰀um (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nAnd here's the ingredient list of a clear gloss by an Indian company called 2.Oh!:\n\n- Aqua (Water, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-30, Isodecyl Oleate, Synthetic Beeswax, Cetrimonium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Undecane, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Tridecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Parfum (Fragrance).\n\nIs this beyond a layperson reading of ingredients lists/ just impossible to tell without using the product? \n\nThe ingredients just read like a conditioner to me. I was told that it would extend the life of a semi-permanent hair colour... does it form a coating that wears away rather than the colour that's deposited? Wouldn't a hair mask do the same thing? \n\nI'd greatly appreciate anyone who can help assuage my undying curiosity 😂 TIA!",

If you’re mixing two things together you could maybe be providing a tone on tone shift but that also depends on what you’re mixing. All in all, if it is coming out of a tube as one product, no mixing required, it’s on the outside of your hair strand. The word “coating” makes it sound bad but it will absolutely fade away over time and as long as it’s designed to be on the hair by a reputable company with a trichology background, it will not “coat”.",

    "body": "After seeing [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/r613jf/my_experience_with_prose_finethin_curlywavy_hair/) on here, I was inspired to share my thoughts about my experience with Prose.\n\n**My hair:** 2A, fine-medium strands and medium density. It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The “factors” they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them 🙄. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called “Odele Volumizing Shampoo” which I used before Prose. And yall… The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that’s what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

There is a study that says that PVP does not provide adequate protection against heat, unlike VP / VA.\r  \n\r  \n\\- Monohydric alcohols provide faster drying, better hold, less frizz and more manageable hair, but this is NOT helpful. Fast drying is stressful for the cuticles. Here you have to choose: straighten wet hair or dry. Some damage during styling with hot tools is the result of water boiling out of the inside of the fiber, causing blisters to form in the cuticle, which, when combed, lead to more damage.\r  \n\r  \nThe less water in your hair, the easier it is to style. There is also less chance of earning bubble hair.\r  \nBut even here it is not without drawbacks: the tools during styling remove more water than the hair can absorb from the air (the scientific term for this loss of moisture is syneresis). To recover from syneresis, it is necessary to submerge the hair in water to restore its original moisture level. At low humidity levels, hair becomes more brittle, breaks and splits more easily. For this, moisturizers are desirable in the composition of the products, which will make the hair more elastic and slow down the evaporation of moisture from the hair.\r  \n\r  \nThis is one of the reasons why I do not recommend thermal protection with monohydric alcohols, especially on a regular basis, and especially on bleached or severely damaged hair. You should not evaluate such thermal protection in terms of care - this is a purely \"convenient\" styling tool.\r  \n\r  \n\\- moisturizers are added to give hair elasticity, protect against dryness, and also to protect the product from drying out\"",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

I don't really know what I'm paying extra for.\n\n\nThis new shampoo touts a gentle formula with \"no sulfates, no parabens, no dyes, no mineral oil and no silicones; great for all hair types\" but I am not well versed in ingredients for what makes a good or bad shampoo. Can anyone help me out ?\n\nIngredients list: \nWater/Eau, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Fragrance/Parfum, Panthenol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Polyquaternium-10, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Salicylic Acid, Polyquaternium-7, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Glycolic Acid, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.ca/Pantene-Sulfate-free-Soothing-Moisture-Shampoo/dp/B07KKYXZZZ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1548438272&sr=8-2&keywords=pantene+rose+water\n\n\n",

The few ingredients that are helpful are so far down the ingredients list that they're essentially useless for anything other than being able to use buzzwords in advertisements. This will clean your hair, probably pretty thoroughly considering most of these ingredients are surfactants. This will not hydrate, strengthen, soften, smooth, volumize or otherwise change your hair in any way. It might fade hair color.\n\nIn general, the ingredients to look for and ingredients to avoid vary a lot based on your hair and what you would like your hair to act like. If your only goal is \"remove dirt, oil, and other gunk from my hair\", this will do that.",

    "body": "Hello! So I've recently fallen in love with swimming as an exercise mainstay, and as a result ,my hair is suffering greatly. I've been taking all the easy precautions like wetting my hair with clean water before getting in the pool and wearing a swim cap, but now I'm looking to specific products that help with removing buildup from chlorine and other pool chemicals. In my research, the only ingredients I've found that are good for this purpose and commonly found in clarifying shampoos and some conditioners are:\n\n* Sodium Thiosulfate ([neutralizes chlorine](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n* Disodium/Tetrasodium EDTA ([chelating agent](http://curiouschemeng.blogspot.com/2014/01/chlorinated-hair.html))\n\nWhich brings me to my question, which is a little silly and neurotic, but I hope someone can help me. I've really fallen in love with this [L'Oreal Kids 2-in-1 Swim Shampoo](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/products/hair-care/products/shampoo/loreal-kids-extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo.aspx?shade=extra-gentle-2-in-1-swim-sport-shampoo). I just love how it smells, I love the bottle, I love how cheap it is, and I love how it reminds me of when I was a kid! Upon looking into the ingredients though, I found neither Sodium Thiosulfate nor EDTAs among them. Here they are listed out:\n\n>AQUA/WATER/EAU • SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE • DISODIUM COCOAMPHODIACETATE • PEG-200 HYDROGENATED GLYCERYL PALMATE • POLYSORBATE 20 • SODIUM CHLORIDE • PEG-7 GLYCERYL COCOATE • HEXYLENE GLYCOL • DISODIUM RICINOLEAMIDO MEA-SULFOSUCCINATE • PARFUM/FRAGRANCE • SODIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • POLYQUATERNIUM-10 • SODIUM METHYLPARABEN • MAGNESIUM LAURETH-8 SULFATE • MAGNESIUM LAURETH SULFATE • SODIUM OLETH SULFATE • DMDM HYDANTOIN • MAGNESIUM OLETH SULFATE • CI 47005 / YELLOW 10 • CI 14700 / RED 4\n\nBasically I want to know, am I missing something? How can L'Oreal confidently claim that this shampoo \"removes chlorine\" if there are no ingredients that are specifically capable of that? I like this product a lot and want to continue using it but I also want to make sure I'm getting all the pool chemicals out of my hair after I swim.\n\n^(In before \"just use it if you like it,\" I know my question is kinda silly, I just want to understand how these ingredients work!)",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

Hasn’t been sold for about 3 years I think): \n\nAqua / Water,Cyclohexasiloxane,Nylon-12,Isododecane,Alcohol Denat.,Cyclopentasiloxane,PEG-10 Dimethicone,Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone,PEG-20,Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate,Disteardimonium Hectorite,Phenoxyethanol,Magnesium Sulfate,Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate,HDI/Trimethylol Hexyllactone Crosspolymer,Titanium Dioxide [Nano] / Titanium Dioxide,Methylparaben,Acrylonitrile/Methyl Methacrylate/Vinylidene Chloride Copolymer,Tocopherol,Butylparaben,Aluminum Hydroxide,Isobutane,Alumina,Silica,Glycerin,Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate\n\nFast forward to 2 months ago I ruined my hair with Garnier ultimate blends coconut oil shampoo (I forgot this brand ruined my hair in the past):\n\nAqua/Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, CI 14700/Red 4, Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Hydroxycitronellal, Sodium Hydroxide, Theobroma Cacao Shea Butter/Cocoa Seed Butter, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Salicylate, Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Caramel, Citric Acid, Hexylene Glycol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Parfum / Fragrance\n\n(Though I do think my hair is bad with coconut oil, I’m not sure if that’s the sole reason as the result is basically the same as when I used this shampoo in the past) \n\nI initially thought that it’s because my hair is already dry and coarse (as well as low porosity fyi) that these shampoos didn’t do me much good as they have drying alcohols and a few sulphates, and nothing that is really moisturising or nourishing. Though, I thought about it more, and in between the two periods I ruined my hair, I was using this shampoo by Herbal & Essences which also does seem pretty drying, but didn’t damage my hair at all (from what I saw physically):\n\nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Hexyl Cinnamal, Magnesium Nitrate, Zea Mays Silk Extract, Rose Extract, Pearl Extract, CI 19140, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Potassium Sorbate, CI 42090\n\nIt in fact has more sulphates, but also more humectants at the same time. Could it be the alcohol? Or is the problem in fact, not the drying of my hair? I’m really lost and scared to buy another shampoo in case I ruin my hair again.",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)​\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n​The two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.   \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces [tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from [traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:  hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html) for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride \n* Polyquaternium-44 \n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed \n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together​\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on thicker hair or 5 - 10 minutes on finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue. On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down. \n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling  method of your choice:\n   * ​Air dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and [heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition. You can also check out my post on [Hygral Fatigue](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hygral-fatigue.html) to learn more about maintaining balance between moisture and protein in your hair. ",

I've been reading and researching about it but got even more confused so I thought I'd ask here lol.\n\nAbout three weeks ago I decided to get one and my hairdresser told me not to use anything containing salt (but said nothing about sulfates, or i might have missed it lol). So, I got the Loreal Eversleek shampoo because its advertised as specifically made and a safe shampoo for keratin treated hair. After I got home I started reading the ingredient list and to my surprise, sodium chloride is listed as an ingredient! So I guess what im asking is if its safe to use? Has anyone tried it? Will it strip off the treatment out of my hair? I dont really get the \\~science\\~ behind it and the differences between using sodium and salts and sulfates.   \nI also have been using a sodium free but not sulfate free shampoo, and I dont really like it so I wanna know if this is safe and worth giving a shot. \n\nHere's the ingredient list: AQUA / WATER / EAU  \nSODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE  \nLAURETH-5 CARBOXYLIC ACID  \n**SODIUM CHLORIDE**  \nCOCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE  \nGLYCERIN  \nPEG-150 DISTEARATE  \nPARFUM / FRAGRANCE  \nCOCONUT ACID  \nSODIUM BENZOATE  \nSODIUM LAUROYL GLUTAMATE  \nPOLYQUATERNIUM-10  \nSALICYLIC ACID  \nHEXYL CINNAMAL  \nLINALOOL  \nBENZYL SALICYLATE  \nBENZYL ALCOHOL  \nHELIANTHUS ANNUUS SEED EXTRACT / SUNFLOWER SEED EXTRACT  \nLIMONENE  \nCITRONELLOL  \nSODIUM HYDROXIDE  \nLACTIC ACID FIL CODE D55635/1\n\nAlso I think is worth mentioning Im from a little country located in South America, so my access to hair products is very limited, and the ones that we have are super overpriced compared to the states.\n\nThank you so much in advance !",

My stylist has always told me to use sulfate-free products and to avoid anything (including styling products)  that has sodium chloride in the ingredient list. IIRC it has something to do with sodium chloride effectively stripping the keratin out of your hair and being abrasive. She explained it to me like this (I'm paraphrasing): You know how when you go swimming in the ocean (or gulf or whatever salt-water body of choice) and your wet hair dries its a little bit crunchy and clumpy? That's from the salt. \n\nScience time: Sulfates are derived from sulfuric acid. They are in a wide range of products, but their primary application is as a lathering or cleansing agent. You know how shampoos that have sulfates lather really really well and sulfate-free ones don't? That's why. Sulfate's purpose in this universe is to clean things and its really good at it. For a person with non-damaged, non-chemically treated a shampoo with sulfates is probably fine. \n\nHowever, for anyone with a compromised cuticle (the outer part of the hair strand; this includes anyone with color or chemical treatment) sulfates are sketchy because they're *too*  good at their job. Most clarifying shampoos just have a lot of sulfates in them.\n\nBottom Line: Your hair isn't gonna fall out or melt off and using the shampoo won't completely strip your treatment out all at once. But sulfates and sodium chloride will decrease the longevity of your treatment. Probably by 25-50%, depending on how frequently you wash your hair.\n\nNB: someone please fact-check my science, chemistry was a reeeaaaaallllly long time ago.",

This led me to this subreddit and now I have been researching various ingredients in haircare. \n\nI would still like to use silicones in my hair but was wondering whether alkyl-quaternized ammonium salts (behentrimonium chloride, cetrimonium chloride, etc.) can be used with amodimethicone. I believe these are cationic surfactants so would they not be suitable in conjunction with amodimethicone as it would cause buildup?

(I'm using UK amazon links as I'm assuming that you're in the UK because of the Holland & Barrett link.) You would need to moisturize your hair after shampooing somehow; there is a section in the wiki of this sub for natural moisturizers.  I don't recommend diluting the shampoo to minimize the drying effect, because then you'd also be diluting the concentration of the herbs which can help fight the dandruff.  Another option is to try co-washing with a tea tree oil conditioner instead; the Giovanni tea tree oil conditioner is a great option for this.  It wouldn't dry out the hair and you'd get the same benefit of the antifungal herbs.  Co-washing involves applying conditioner as if it's shampoo, massaging it really well into the scalp and hair, which can help break up some of the oil and buildup because conditioners have gentle cleansing agents in them as well, and oils can break down other oils.\n\nDo you do any mechanical cleaning to maintain the scalp, or are you just rinsing your hair with water?  If you don't currently do mechanical cleaning, it's an important aspect of scalp care in No Poo hair washing.  There is an article linked in the side column on Water Only washing that explains what's involved for mechanical cleaning.",

Nizoral will probably dry out your scalp but dandruff means fungal overgrowth and fungus loves moisture. If rhe dryness becomes unbearable try using less + if you have medium-long hair you can still condition the ends. The only home remedies I know for the fungus that causes this is salt water and apple cider vinegar but never tried them because most home remedies I've tried have been BS. Might also be worth looking at your lifestyle and diet and see if you've changed anything as dandruff can be triggered by other health conditions or life changes e.g. mine was triggered by a hormonal treatment but went away when I stopped. Then I got it SO bad when I was vaping daily that it even spread to my face and I had to use canesten cream on my face twice a day (my hypothesis is because vape juices usually contain sugar alcohol sweeteners and fungus likes sugar but im not a scientist so who knows lol) but again after a week of quitting all the dandruff was gone",

Which has sulfates and as far as i can tell no silicones or plastics. I scritch my hair everyday, then use a tangle tease ([https://www.tangleteezer.com/shop/detangling/the-original/panther-black/](https://www.tangleteezer.com/shop/detangling/the-original/panther-black/)) brush to detangle my hair. Then I preen my hair and use the tangle tease to brush my hair. I wash my hair with warm water every 3 days and then end the wash with cold water. I only comb my hair with a wide tooth comb after washing and wash my bush and comb everyday. After 4 weeks i can see that my hair is looking healthier and not too greasy but due to surfing everyday I find my hair doesn't feel great at all.  It does look okay, much better than the previous cycle of washing with shampoo (looks super fluffy and horrible with no control, then super greasy when I don't wash it for a few days, but at least then I have control and some style from it). Therefore I have a few questions:\n\n1. My hair is always washed with sea water (super salty) because I surf everyday, what should I do?\n2. The amount of salt and sand I clean from my brush everyday is kinda crazy. \n3. Does my 'clarifying shampoo' have enough sulfates and no silicones or plastics?\n4. Should I be using a boar-bristle brush instead of the tangle tease (the tangle tease really is the only brush that can detangle my hair without ripping it all out after surfing, again due to the sea water/amount of salt in the water).\n5. I find preening very difficult as I'm a guy with getting close to ponytail length hair and it seems like my hair just gets in the way of being able to preen the side and back sections properly.\n6. How often should I 'wash' my hair (in the shower) considering everyday i swim in salt water.\n7. Due to the salt water my hair feels almost solid and not really nice to touch. (it feels way better to touch after washing with traditional shampoo but looks horrible/dry/fluffy/frizzy and is uncontrollable).\n8. I worry that now I need a haircut the barber will refuse to cut it without a traditional shampoo wash from the salon first, due to its texture.\n9. I clean my brushes by leaving them in a bowl full of water with a squirt (tiny amount) of washing up liquid ([https://theecologist.org/2009/feb/05/behind-label-fairy-liquid](https://theecologist.org/2009/feb/05/behind-label-fairy-liquid)). Should I just switch to honey instead of washing up liquid?\n\nInecto Naturals Coconut Shampoo (ingredients):\n\nAQUA (WATER/EAU), SODIUM, LAURETH SULFATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, COCAMIDOPROPYL, BETAINE, PPG-2, HYDROXETHYL, COCO/ISOSTEARAMIDE, GLYCOL, DISTEARATE, STEARETH-4, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL, POLYQUATERNIUM-10, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), SODIUM HYDROXIDE, CITRIC ACID. \n\nAgain thank you for all your help\n\npeace",

        "body": "Your shampoo looks fine. \n\nIt has been recommended that if you're going to swim in chlorine or salt water that you wet your hair with fresh water first so it doesn't absorb as much swimming water, and then rinse really well again after to rinse it away.\n\nSalt is very drying, I'd recommend some moisture treatments. I've been experimenting with washing with mucilage made from flax and marshmallow root. It is very slippery and might help you detangle your hair nicely. It also leaves a coating on my hair that might help protect yours from the salt water. People use flax gel/mucilage on their hair every day to style it, so I don't imagine there is anything to worry about using it every day to wash the salt out. You can mix it with some aloe or coconut water to give your hair and scalp some moisture also.\n\nYou can find a nice low poo co-wash to use for when you want to get your hair cut, or need it to not be beach hair. r/curlyhair has an extensive list of good low poo products and a bot you can paste ingredient lists into to see if a different one qualifies. It wouldn't be the end of the world if you got a shampoo there, but you'd have to be aware if it has silicones in it. Many people tell their stylists that they don't want the shampoo or any product and it's usually fine unless the stylist is a snob, in which case it's best to find a different one willing to listen to you. I've told some that I'm allergic, which is close enough to the truth as I'm sensitive and it makes me sick. And my current stylist knows I'm natural nopoo and has no problem working with me.",

PPG (Polypropylene glycol) and Polyquaternium \n\n4.: boar bristle brushes are not for detangling. They are for distributing oil. I use a wide toothed wooden comb for detangling. Make sure to start at the tips of your hair and slowly work up. If you could put your hair together while surfing it would probably help as well. \n\n5.: do it right side up, flipped over and with parts flipped to one side or tied/pinned up. My hair is a bit long and that’s the best way for me to do it. \n\n6.: I think you should rinse the salt water out every time and how often you properly wash depends on your sebum production and scalp health. \n\n7.: again: soak in fresh water & rinse with fresh water. If that’s not enough together with preening the sebum to your tips you could look into “conditioner only” (CO) washing (specific ingredients have to be avoided)\n\n8.: call and ask if they would do it only with water, if they have silicone free products, if they have sulphate free products. One wash is not going to undo everything. You can also find a good CO wash or low poo and bring it to the salon (ask them to wash with that).\n\n9.: I would add some scrubbing with your fingers to that.

        "body": "For a shampoo thickener, Crothix is usually fairly common. Don't know how you feel about the ingredient, but it does really well at 1-2 wt%. Alternatively, sulfonates can be thickened with salt (either monovalent NaCl or divalent MgCl2). Usually somewhere around 2-4 wt% is the transition point to networked worm-like micelle gels.\n\nGetting that much SCI to dissolve can be difficult. Definitely pre-dissolve SCI in CAPB first. It isn't an easy substance to work with, for sure and can contribute to an opaque product when cooked to room temp (around 20 °C or so).\n\nYour conditioner doesn't have an emulsifier fit for this system. Glyceryl stearate can be a great secondary emulsifier, but it is best used when paired with something that forms normal micelles like PEG-100 glyceryl stearate to bring the emulsion back into a place where it can be kinetically stabilized. Using both together helps promote lamellar networks that contribute to better emulsion stability. \n\nMany try BTMS or BTMCl because it provides thickening and conditioning. I'd use polyquaternium-10 and polyquaternium-7 in your conditioner, but save the polyquaternium-7 for your shampoo. Quaternized HEC tends not to play well with strong anionics (like sulfonates, which is what SCI is).\n\nI'm not sure the reasoning for avoiding sulfates, but sulfonates are basically the same, so if you worry about stripping, these both can be formulated to be gentler. \n\nChatGPT sucks and usually doesn't give good answers. I would try and learn more about how these ingredients work before making a complicated emulsion like a conditioner or shampoo. \n\nTry making a simple 3-5 ingredient hand wash that uses salt to thicken to get a feel for thickening, and test out a simple emulsion (like a 4 ingredient lotion) before wasting too much on expensive polyquats.\n\nAlso pH will matter a lot! Make sure you're pHing your product at the end appropriately. 0.25 wt% citric acid might not be enough to bring the pH down to the proper place. Always leave extra room for pHing and make up the difference in water.",

I don't know how to describe it, but it almost feels rough and in need of conditioner? and my ends feel drier that normal. I am not sure whats happening my first thought was damage since I've been growing it out for almost a year without a trim or a cut. Now i'm starting to think that there is some sort of build up?

I haven't found this in everystore that carries SM, but in a fair amount of them.\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\n\"Divide damp hair into sections. Apply 2 to 3 pumps to each section and comb through. Style as desired.\"\n\n**Pros**\n\nIt wasn't waxy!! Yay! It seemed moisturizing also, so that's great.  Light- didn't weigh down my fine hair.\n\n**Cons**\n\nNo hold whatsoever.  If I'm paying $10 for a product I'll go through quickly(trust me, I'm using a lot of product and still not getting the results I want), I want it to actually work. I feel like it's expensive on its own and doesn't offer the moisture AND hold I wanted.\n\n**Overall**\n\nIf you have hair that doesn't frizz easily, this might be the product for you. My hair is fairly porous, and it needs a bit of hold to keep it in clumps instead of frizzing out. This product was not it. :( Sad times.",

Soaps and shampoos can sometimes trigger these symptoms as well, but I’ve FINALLY found a shampoo that doesn’t do those things and I truly love its scent. Because of my unfortunate sensitivities, it’s difficult to find things like scented candles or room air fresheners that don’t trigger some kind of adverse response. I would LOVE to know what comprises their “Fragrance (parfum)” as listed on their Ingredients list. It would be wonderful to be one of those people whose house smells of a lovely candle and be able to breathe comfortably in the surrounding aroma. I might even find a perfume I could wear. (I can handle wearing a touch of D&G Light Blue for a couple hours before the pinch of a headache begins.)\n\nI’ve written to and emailed the company asking about their “Exclusive Agadir aroma,” but have not gotten any reply or response. I’d guess it’s a secret proprietary formula or something, but I’d be happy to learn even one of the scents Agadir uses for their aroma. I’m reading more about the argania spinosa kernel oil, but the ingredients list still contains that elusive “Fragrance (parfum).”\n\nThanks to any and all who took the time to look at this post and I’d like to express sincere gratitude to anybody that might be able to shine some light on this.

    "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a bit of a haircare/hair science newbie, and I searched the sub and combed through the wiki to try to figure this out myself, but I’m still at a loss, probably because I just don’t quite understand which haircare ingredients do what. Anyway, all this to say that I’m sorry if this has been asked or covered before. I just couldn’t find it on my own. If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I’ve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I’m hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It’s A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I’ve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there’s a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I’ve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I’ve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don’t despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn’t feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I’m using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn’t go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don’t think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there’s any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

    "body": "I have bleached and dyed my hair for years.  (I haven't done either since before this issue started) My hair is generally fine and dark blonde.  I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.  I liked Keraphix and it did what I was hoping, making my hair feel thicker and heavier.  However in about the last 5 months or so my hair suddenly became REALLY tangly.\n\nWhile I'm washing  and conditioning it it hard to get my fingers through my hair. I know you aren't supposed to brush wet hair, but I used to be able to slide a brush right through with no issues and now when I get out of the shower it is a nightmare getting a comb through it. Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!  Below are the Keraphix ingredients in case that is helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've been reading more on the sidebar.

        "body": "I think the problem could be too much protein. Keratin is a protein and there are other proteins as well in those products. When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

They are based on individual ingredients rather than **any negative effects the final product may have.** The way ingredients interact in a formulation can influence their potential impact, and the presence of a specific ingredient does not automatically equate to harm when used in a product. It's always crucial to do your own research, consider the product as a whole, and keep in mind that personal reactions can vary greatly. When making decisions about personal care products, it is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brief**: While this product, produced and distributed by Amazon as a house brand, stands out for its cost-effectiveness, it does contain certain ingredients that may be of concern to some parents. It features 2 synthetic color additives and 1 fragrance for aesthetic and olfactory appeal. The synthetic additive D&C Yellow No. 10, aimed at delivering a visually appealing color, can increase sun sensitivity amongst other side effects. Moreover, the additive 'Fragrance', incorporated for an appealing scent, could potentially induce respiratory and eczema issues in certain infants. Hence, parents who are apprehensive about these potential side effects should be cautious while considering this product for use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium laureth sulfate, PEG-150 distearate, fragrance, tetrasodium EDTA, polyquaternium-10, PEG-175 diisostearate, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, yellow 10, orange 4.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Typical ingredients description and side effects\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peg-80 Sorbitan Laurate\n   * PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate is a surfactant and emulsifier that's often used in cosmetics and personal care products, including baby shampoos. It helps to mix oil and water-based ingredients, and can help to cleanse the skin and hair by helping water to mix with oil and dirt, allowing them to be rinsed away.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: While PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate is generally considered safe, some individuals might experience skin irritation or an allergic reaction, such as redness, itching, or a rash. However, these instances are relatively rare.\n      * Eye Irritation: As with any soap product, there is a potential for eye irritation if the product gets into the eyes. This can lead to discomfort and temporary redness. It's always important to avoid the eye area when using shampoo.\n      * Environmental Considerations: PEGs (polyethylene glycols), including PEG-80 Sorbitan Laurate, are petroleum-based compounds, and there are concerns about their biodegradability and impact on the environment.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Cocamidopropyl Betaine\n   * Cocamidopropyl betaine is a surfactant commonly used in personal care products, including baby lotions, due to its mild cleansing and foaming properties. It is generally well-tolerated and considered safe for use. However, in some rare cases, individuals may experience certain side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Although uncommon, some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to cocamidopropyl betaine. This can lead to skin irritation or allergic reactions such as redness, itching, rash, or hives. If your baby develops any of these symptoms after using a baby lotion containing cocamidopropyl betaine, discontinue use and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of cocamidopropyl betaine with the eyes may cause mild eye irritation. It is important to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)\n   * Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) is a common ingredient used in many cleaning and hygiene products, including shampoos, body washes, and toothpastes. It's a surfactant, a type of compound that helps create lather and makes a product more effective at removing dirt and oils. In baby shampoos, SLES is often used because it's milder and less irritating to the skin and eyes than some other types of surfactants, like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). Nonetheless, there has been ongoing debate about the safety of SLES, especially in products used on babies and young children.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: SLES can be irritating to the skin, especially if left on for extended periods of time or used in high concentrations. This can lead to redness, dryness, or itching. People with sensitive skin or skin conditions such as eczema may be more prone to these effects.\n      * Eye Irritation: If a product containing SLES gets into the eyes, it can cause irritation, resulting in redness and discomfort.\n      * Possible Contamination with 1,4-Dioxane: During the manufacturing process of SLES, it can potentially be contaminated with 1,4-Dioxane, a substance that has been classified as a possible human carcinogen. However, this is generally at extremely low levels, if present at all, and most manufacturers have processes in place to remove this contaminant.\n      * Environmental Impact: There are some concerns about the environmental impact of SLES, particularly its potential for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* PEG-150 Distearate\n   * PEG-150 Distearate is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester of stearic acid. It's commonly used in personal care products, including baby wipes, as an emulsifier, thickener, or cleansing agent. While PEG-150 Distearate is generally considered safe for use in personal care products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In rare cases, some individuals might experience minor skin irritation or an allergic reaction such as redness, itching, or a rash. This is more likely if the individual has sensitive skin.\n      * Eye Irritation: As with many ingredients in shampoo and other personal care products, PEG-150 Distearate could cause eye irritation if the product gets into the eyes.\n      * Potential Contamination: There's a low risk of PEG-150 Distearate being contaminated with potentially harmful substances during manufacturing, such as 1,4-dioxane or ethylene oxide, both of which have been associated with health risks. However, most manufacturers have rigorous processes in place to ensure that such contaminants, if present, are at safe levels.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phenoxyethanol\n   * Phenoxyethanol is used as a preservative in cosmetic products and also as a stabilizer in perfumes and soaps. Exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to reactions ranging from eczema to severe, life-threatening allergic reactions. Infant oral exposure to phenoxyethanol can acutely affect nervous system function.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: In some cases, phenoxyethanol can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, presenting as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some people may experience an allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Eczema: It is also a common allergic reaction to skin exposure of products containing one percent or more phenoxyethanol. Reactions only occur in the area of application and eczema subsides after avoidance of the product causing irritation.\n      * Acute nervous system effects (infants): In 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase Mommy’s Bliss Nipple Cream. Phenoxyethanol, found in the cream, was depressing the central nervous system and causing vomiting and diarrhea in breast feeding infants. Symptoms of a depressed nervous system include a decrease in infant’s appetite, difficulty waking the infant, limpness of extremities and change in skin color. There is no known health risk to the mother.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Peg 175 Diisostearate\n   * PEG-175 Diisostearate is a type of polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester of isostearic acid, and it's commonly used as an emulsifier or surfactant in personal care products, including baby lotions. While PEG-175 Diisostearate is generally considered safe for use in personal care products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation when using products containing PEG-175 Diisostearate. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to such irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: While not common, some people may have an allergic reaction to PEG-175 Diisostearate, which could result in symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * **EWG Skin Grade:** 3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sodium Hydroxide\n   * Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda or lye, is a strong alkaline compound that is sometimes used in the manufacturing process of personal care products, including baby lotions. It is used to adjust the pH of the formulation to ensure stability and efficacy. However, it is important to note that sodium hydroxide itself is not typically listed as an active ingredient in baby lotions, but rather used in very small amounts for pH adjustment purposes.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Sodium hydroxide, if present in higher concentrations, can cause skin irritation in some individuals. This may manifest as redness, itching, burning sensation, or rash. It is important to discontinue use if your baby experiences any of these symptoms and consult a healthcare professional.\n      * Eye Irritation: Direct contact of baby lotion containing sodium hydroxide with the eyes can cause mild to moderate eye irritation. It is crucial to avoid contact with the eyes and rinse thoroughly with water if accidental exposure occurs.\n      * Chemical Burns: Sodium hydroxide is a caustic substance and can cause chemical burns if used undiluted or in high concentrations. However, in properly formulated baby lotions, the concentration of sodium hydroxide is typically low and safe for use.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* D&C Orange No. 4\n   * D&C Orange No. 4 is a synthetic color additive that is often used in personal care products to give them a certain color. The \"D&C\" indicates that it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in drugs and cosmetics, but not in food. While D&C Orange No. 4 is generally considered safe for use in cosmetic products, there are potential side effects.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Like many ingredients in personal care products, D&C Orange No. 4 could potentially cause skin irritation in some individuals. This might manifest as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin and may be more susceptible to such reactions.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though less common, some individuals may experience an allergic reaction to D&C Orange No. 4, which could result in symptoms like hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Sensitivity to Sunlight: Some artificial colorants can make skin more sensitive to sunlight, which could increase the risk of sunburn.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* D&C Yellow No. 10\n   * D&C Yellow No. 10 is a synthetic color additive that's used in certain drugs, cosmetics, and other personal care products. It's used to give products a specific color. The \"D&C\" denotes that the color additive is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in drugs and cosmetics, but not in food.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Skin Irritation: Some people may experience skin irritation when using products containing D&C Yellow No. 10. This could present as redness, itching, or a rash. Babies have sensitive skin, so they may be more susceptible to such irritation.\n      * Allergic Reactions: Though not common, some people may have an allergic reaction to D&C Yellow No. 10, which could result in symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing.\n      * Sensitivity to Sunlight: Some synthetic colorants may make skin more sensitive to sunlight, which could increase the risk of sunburn.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fragrance\n   * \"Fragrance\" in the ingredient list of baby lotions (and other personal care products) is often a catch-all term for a mix of various scent-producing chemicals. Fragrances can make products smell pleasant, but they can also cause some potential side effects, especially in people with sensitive skin or allergies. In babies, who generally have more sensitive skin than adults, these side effects might include.\n   * **Potential Side Effects:**\n      * Allergic Reactions: Although it's not common, some babies might have an allergic reaction to certain fragrances, which could lead to symptoms such as hives, swelling, or difficulty breathing. These reactions might not occur the first time the baby is exposed to the fragrance, but could develop after repeated use.\n      * Sensitization: Regular exposure to certain fragrances can lead to the development of a sensitivity over time, where the body starts reacting to a substance that it was previously okay with. This can lead to allergic contact dermatitis, a type of eczema.\n      * Respiratory Issues: Inhaling some fragrances can trigger respiratory symptoms, particularly in babies with asthma or other pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n   * **EWG Skin Grade:** 8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe grading system used by EWG in the Skin Deep database is as follows:\n\n1 to 2: Low hazard\n\n3 to 6: Moderate hazard\n\n7 to 10: High hazard",

Upon moving out, she gifted me with what can only be called an industrial sized container of the Special Cleansing Gel and about 6 bottles of the Active Moist (she's...excessive, I know! Ack she really...really shouldn't have <3). So now it seems those are going to be my staple skincare products for a while.\n\n\nI was wondering what you all thought of these products and whether or not I should opt for something highly recommended by /SCA and /AB or stick with these items (my skin has zero reaction to them, neither great nor terrible. The cleansing gel foams nicely and from what I have gathered, has a neutral pH. The active moist is very light and leaves my skin slightly tacky once it dries -- I wouldn't say it's very \"plumping\")\n\nThank you for all your advice and information thus far!! <3 I'm excited to take my first plunge into true skin care :) \n\n\nEDIT: Oh! I should mention I have an oily/normal skin with hormonal acne, slightly enlarged pores in my oily areas, and PIE/PIH on my cheeks. I'm still in the beginning stages of figuring out what to do about all of this, haha. Any help would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nAnd finally, I thought I would include an ingredient list for anyone who's interested:\n\nCleansing Gel: Water/Aqua/Eau, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Quillaja Saponaria Bark Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben.\n\nActive Moist:\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Methyl Gluceth-20, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone, Lactamide MEA, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Hedera Helix (Ivy) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Parietaria Officinalis Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Flower/Leaf Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Saponaria Officinalis Leaf/Root Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Glycolipids, Sodium Hyaluronate, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Palmitoyl, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Amylopectin/Glycerin Crosspolymer, Lecithin, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Allantoin, Panthenol, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyquaternium-10, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polysorbate 60, Aminomethyl Propanol, Disodium EDTA, Linalool, Lavandula Hybrida Oil.",

The body shop shampoo doesn’t have it in, but I’ve tried the only curls cleanser & umberto giannini scalp restore and got really itchy both times - and they both have polyquaternium 10 in!

It took them two years to post two pages! Anyway, someone mentioned Eucerin sells a shampoo in the UK that is advertised as not containing coco betaine: [Eucerin DermoCapillaire Calming Urea Shampoo](http://www.eucerin.co.uk/products/dermocapillaire/calming-urea-shampoo).\n\nHere are the ingredients:\n\nAqua, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Urea, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lactate, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Coco Glucoside, Laureth-9, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Glyceryl Oleate, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Salicylate\n\nWoohoo!! Eucerin doesn't sell it in the US but Amazon will ship it (it's expensive, IMO, and takes a month!).\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything majorly wrong with the ingredients besides the sulfate I already know about. I searched it on Cosdna and on here and didn't find anything particularly negative. I have keratosis pilaris so it could actually help that, too, I suppose.",

So maybe try adding some or increasing your chosen dispersing agent.\n\nCocamide monoethanolamine and cocamide diethanolamine carry no cleaning properties, but are used to create that full-bodied foam that comes from lathering the shampoo into your hair. But also remember that foam isn't what actually cleans the hair the ammonium is so low lather isn't necessarily bad. \n\nNot sure if this will help at all or if it's what you're looking for, but I hope it does.

These are used in conditioners because they adhere to the hair strongly (resist rinse off). They are not used in shampoos because they are cationic (positive charge) and they form insoluble salts with the shampoo detergents which are anionic (positive charge).  In conditioners these ingredients work a bit better than the other type of Quat - Polyquaterniums.\n\nPolyquats are polymers that have a positive charge. They can be used in shampoos because they don’t form insoluble salts with the detergent. They also will deposit on the hair when the shampoo is being rinsed off due to a phenomenon called Dilution Deposition. This doesn’t happen in conditioner formulas however.\n\nSo in general polyquats go in shampoos. Quats go in conditioners.  You can use polyquats in conditioners but Quats work better, are less expensive and don’t leave a film on hair. Yes that slight hold you get is from the polyquats.",

Then maybe the one n only color removal system to take the rest of that old color off?\n\nBut if the one n only can remove metallic salts then that’s good to know and also the ion one...plz help me out before she destroys her hair and the. I have to do all this extensive work that could’ve been prevented.\n\nShe just wants to have a red color by her bday and  I don’t want her to ruin her hair by throwing color all over it Or lightener.\n\nI am great with color. I just want to know if all or any of these two besides Malibu removes metallic salts.???",

I live in the Midwest and we often have to deal with metallic salt buildup from a lot of other sources but mainly well water. When I wanted to go from purple to white silvery blonde my teacher who has been a colorist for 13 years had me use the Malibu CPR to rid myself of (1) as much color as I could and (2) the metallic salts that were in my water. I asked her why that one because I want to be a product specialist and she said from her experience with working with numerous different similar products that the Malibu CPR works on many different hair types, gives a consistent result, and is the easiest on the hair.",

        "body": "Hey so I'm still in school and this is kind of old, but I can tell you 1) the one n only isnt the same as the other two and 2) if you find a product with similar ingredients in general they will probably perform the same. My boyfriend is a microbiologist and he used to work in generics and they really do come up with their formulas by reading the ingredients of a product and reverse engineering it. Also the off brand and brand name products are usually made in the same facility. At his last job he did household products and he said the Lysol formula was the same as the Walgreen's and Target brand wipes, they just used different wipe materials. Same for baby wipes and dollar store medicine. Sometimes we'd walk the aisles and he'd turn something over to see if he tested it and often times he did haha. Lil off topic, but the CPR and the Ion use non ammonia or peroxide methods to take the dye out. If you look it up they're actually a lot of vitamin c and vinegar dried out it seems. Which is a great home remedy for removing dye anyway. I've had drying but no damage with them and have used them up to twice in 1 day. It depends on the dye but I get between 1 and 4 levels of removal on my semi colors. Honestly I get about the same results as color oops but CPR and Ion are technically formulated for direct colors. One N only is meant for permanent dyes and uses a developer as its last step, which if you haven't rinsed the hair out enough can cause the permanent color to reoxidize. I find it unreliable at best and get about a 50/50 shot when I use it as far as if the color gets fully out or reoxidezes. I honestly stopped using it after 5 trials in my teens with friends. If I need a replacement for permanent color, I go with color oops. I don't believe in bleach once your hair is a certain level, it chemicals at all really anymore since I started using the Ion when it came out last year as its so readily available. I'm really pleased with the results but even if I wasn't I'd recommend just about anything over one n only. Hopefully this helps for the future and she didn't ruin her hair!",

Generally things that contain silicone substances can buildup easily in hair, and will usually require a stronger surfectant to remove.\n\nThe amodimethicone would be water soluble if it had both trideceth-12 AND centrimonium chloride, but it seems to be missing the chloride part of the equation so I would say that is a likely culprit. \n\nAlso the divinyldimethicone/dimethicone copolymer is water insoluble, which needs a stronger surfectant to remove.",

Fyi, i use oil control shampoos as a counter for excessive sebum.\n\n**To start off i've noticed that some specific shampoos, f.e some H&S ones, with similar ingredients in them, tend to be more aggrevvating towards rosacea and they usually leave a flared up feeling post wash that can last, depending on how serious your rosacea is. However, they tend to be more effective towards acne (if you also have that) and dandruff.**\n\n* *Example 1-> Product: Head & Shoulders Deep Cleanse For Oily Scalp*\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Cocamide MEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Citrate, Parfum, Piroctone Olamine, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Sodium Salicylate, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium-10, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Limonene, Sodium Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Propylene Glycol, Hydroxycitronellal, Linalool, Citronellol, Citrus Limon Fruit Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, CI 42090*\n\n**Other shampoos like the le petit marseillais one** **(or gen ones that are more eco) with very different ingredients in it and missing the most well known trigger ingredients, is more friendly towards rosacea. I did notice that, post using it, my hair look more thin, shedding and thats a bit worrying. (placebo?!)**\n\n*Example 2->Product: Le Petit Marseillais w/ Thyme and White Clay*\n\n* *Ingredients: Aqua, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Thymus Vulgaris Extract, Kaolin, Polyquaternium-10, Glycol Distearate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Linalool.*\n\n**P.S: Ingredients that can trigger rosacea flare ups, quoting AAD:**\n\n* *Alcohol*\n* *Camphor*\n* *Fragrance*\n* *Glycolic acid*\n* *Lactic acid*\n* *Menthol*\n* *Sodium lauryl sulfate (often found in shampoos)*\n* *Urea*\n\nThere's also shampoos that belong to an in between category, having slightly different ingredients in them, but i do notice that, thus far, none of them are as friendly as an eco shampoo which doesn't have the same ingredients as a H&S one, or has them in a very low percent.\n\nThis makes sense as ingredients that trigger rosacea when applied to the face straight away, can be effective when applying them to your hair/scalp which is a continuation of your face contact area. You can mitigate the consequences by avoiding shampoo run down your face/wash well post shampoo etc...\n\nYou can drop your recommendations below as well as the ingredients involved in the products you use.",

    "body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI have been a member of the club for almost 3 days. I have a few trivial questions:\n\n(1) my salon told me to wash my (lace) system every 3 days. To maximise service life, is it really necessary to wash the system every three days or is it better to wash it more frequently or less frequently?\nI was given the following two products for washing the system.\n\nA) Nourishing special shampoo for a healthy hair system - every time when washing.\nFor strong hair with a high proportion of nourishing ingredients. The nourishing ingredients loosen tangles and gently cleanse the hair system.  The shampoo provides your real hair with natural nutrients that are otherwise absorbed via the scalp and are therefore not found in standard shampoos.gentle cleansing for the hair and hair structure. \n\nIngredients: \nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Oil, 1,2,3-Propantriol, Laureth-4, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Citric Acid, Parfum.\n\nB) Intensive treatment - At least once a week\n\nDissolves tangles and maximises the life of the hair system and strengthens the real hair and gives it a natural fullness.\n\nIngredients: \nAqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, 1,2,3 Propantriol, Argania Spinosa Oil, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Camelia Sinensis Extract, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Allantoin, Urea, Sodium Lactate, Propylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, TEA-Lactate, Serine, Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Parfum\n\n(2) i sleep with my system on a silk pillow. Is a silk bonnet recommended to extend the life of the system? Any other advantages? Are there any disadvantages (such as greater risk of sweating) ? Any recommendations for one on amazon that is cheap and good quality? \n\n(3) If you spend hours in the sun, it is advisable to wear a cap to prevent the system from bleaching out with time. Is there anything to consider when putting on caps or helmets (e.g. bicycle or ski helmets)? Is the pressure on the system a problem? Can you damage it or anything? \n\n(4)Last and maybe a ridiculous question on top :-): How do you dress? putting clothes over head on back to front to minimise the risk of it coming off.\n\nThank you very much and have a nice day ",

        "body": "You may well get a variety of responses here, so I will just share what works for me. \n\n1. I only shampoo and condition once a week, and that is also when I take my system off to do maintenance and re-install. I could go longer for sure, but I enjoy my weekly routine and find it works better for my scalp and is nicely hygienic. When I started out with a salon they wanted me in every 4 weeks, which seems really gross to me now in comparison.\n\nI use leave in conditioner pretty much daily, and Argan oil probably every 2-3 days. Always after I’ve sprayed the hair with water. I do use a “continuous spray” bottle which makes a big difference. I do this more by feel than schedule at this point. I might rinse my system in the shower during the week (water only) if I think I need to (eg dusty yard work, etc), but if the hair feels good I leave it alone. I will occasionally use a deeper conditioner (on my weekly maintenance) with an older system that is not bouncing back as well. This will start to happen over time. \n\n2. I use a silk pillow case. I wore a silk bonnet for a long time as well, but I actually found that to be detrimental to my lace system. Probably totally fine for poly, but I found that I had more hairs getting embedded in the wrong side of my system when I wore the bonnet. My theory is that it compacts the hair too much. I don’t think I have noticed a single hair shed with just a silk pillow case, so I am sticking with that strategy. \n\n3. I wear a hat in the sun. Some of the leave ins have a sunscreen built in, but these systems are heavily treated so the sun is the enemy. You can get a lot of colour change in a hurry with sun exposure, and trying to correct the colour (despite there being a million products to do that with) is a major pain. I go with the hat if it’s sunny, and I try to avoid anything too tight on the front hairline. It’s not that it will damage your system, but the headband gets hot and sweaty so if that is in direct contact with your hairline you could create a sticky mess. \n\n4. Dress like a normal person. Lol. Putting on a shirt is not going to do anything. I mean, don’t go out of your way to create friction with your hairline but I’ve never had an issue with that personally. \n\nGood luck with your hair journey!",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nPersonally (and according to advice from the salon and people here), I only use shampoo + conditioner once a week. Since my hair (on the sides, in the back) tends to have dandruff, I have to wash it every 4-5 days. As I can't simply wet + wash this part, I wet the whole head, and only use conditioner on the system.\n\nTo sleep, at first I bought satin bonnets. Then I invested in a silk pillowcase (it's pretty expensive if it's silk, so you have to be careful not to be fooled). I like bonnets because they tend to cover my eyes and help me stay asleep. The big advantage is that it keeps the hairstyle in place.  It's happened to me several times that, after a trip to the hairdresser, I don't really need to style my hair in the morning thanks to the cap (of course, it all depends on your hairstyle).\n\nI kept my system for 8 months (it could have been a bit longer, but I didn't want to come back with more hair density overnight).\n\nThe sun bleached my hair, but nothing abnormal (it has the same effect as for everyone else: in summer, your hair gets lighter). \n\nI dress in such a way as not to mess up my hair, so there's no risk of it coming unstuc haha.",

I used it as a shampoo/conditioner all-in-one. However - I am now in Canada and this product is too difficult to source, and I wanted to find something thats readily available in north america.\n\nSo - I shifted to Redken All Soft shampoo and conditioner. I'm not certain if its the shampoo or conditioner thats causing this - but my scalp feels irritated and itchy. I'm guessing I'm allergic to something, or it could be sulphates. I do not believe in the 'science' behind curly girl method, but I did suffer from canker sores for 20+ years, and cankersores were eliminated once I switched to a non-sulphate toothpaste.\n\nSo i'm wondering if it is the sulphates that are causing my scalpt to itch. Is there a way to test (i.e. put product on the skin?)\n\ninterestingly - the product from Japan Notto by Rezo does appear to be curly girl approved when i copy paste the ingredieents into here: [https://www.curlsbot.com/](https://www.curlsbot.com/) \\- so maybe my scalp likes the sulphate free option, not sure!\n\nmy hair needs a lot of moisture and its very course. its caucasion hair, but apparently quite unusually thick and dense and dry. i'm looking to add moisture to my dry hair, and experiementing wiht the Kevin Murphy clay, Paul Mitchelle Mousse, and Hanz de Fuco Scheme Cream to apply to damp hair \n\nmy hairdresser mentienod the Olaplex line, but I dont have any other ideas on what to try next. I am also trying different hair products (i.e. Kevin Murphy, etc) for styling - so I wanted a product that can get my hair clean.

I get wanting to find something suitable though, I just gave up on it because I don't have the money to keep trying stuff out. Olaplex is great, I use their n.3 once a month and leave it in for a few hours. \n\nBut in all seriousness, if you think you're allergic, I think it would be wise to get it checked out and maybe switch to an antiallergic shampoo for now? I'm not an expert or anything, just my two cents. \n\nThe Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety has a list of ingredients which are established contact allergens; [https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific\\_committees/opinions\\_layman/perfume-allergies/en/figtableboxes/table-13-1.htm](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/perfume-allergies/en/figtableboxes/table-13-1.htm)\n\nSo maybe you can check all your hair products to find a pattern? That's how I found out my scalp will itch like crazy if I use anything with CITRONELLOL or CINNAMAL, so when I shop for styling products I just check for those and I'll be good 9 out of 10 times.",

Hair is made of protein and protein can help with curl structure and strength (again read the blog post). The recommendation I’ve seen is people with low porosity hair can have a little protein in one or two products or do a protein treatment once a month. Best practice is to try adding a little protein to your routine and try it once or twice to see how your hair reacts then switch off to a non-protein product for a few washes to see how your hair reacts. My hair is low porosity and fine and I currently use protein in my deep conditioner and gel and it is a little too much on the protein side of the protein-moisture balance. So I bought a moisture-only deep conditioner and for a few weeks I’m going to see if alternating my protein DC and my new moisture DC will help balance my hair.\n\n*exceptions if your hair is protein sensitive \n\nMy advice: if your budget allows get two deep conditioners (one with protein, one with moisture) or look for samples and travel sizes to try out a few DCs without committing to a whole tub of product. \n\nOne cautionary note: if you go with your second deep conditioner, it has glycerin high on its list. Glycerin works best in a certain temperant range of temperature, so if you are in a location that is has cold, dry air right now that product could cause frizz depending on your routine.",

Cetaphil PRO Foam Wash\n2. Galderma Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 10% (I plan on buying the 5% one after finishing this one because I made a mistake buying the highest concentration)\n3. Cetaphil PRO Oil absorbing Moisturizer SPF 30\n\nPM Routine:\n\n1. Cetaphil PRO Foam Wash\n\nI don't have moisturizer in night because I still have not bought the neutrogena oil-free moisturizer and I have stopped using my Baroness Aloe vera gel because I am guessing that it is causing me breakouts. I also plan to buy the Galderma Adapalene Gel and put it in my night routine. Any additional advice is greatly appreciated. Thank You!",

My university's pharmacy sells stuff like CeraVe and Aqua Glycolic very cheap ($11 for a tub of CeraVe, and I believe the toner is $13), so I can afford to try stuff out. \n\nI've also seen that CVS is now carrying Nip + Fab products. The questions I've seen here concern their pads, which is not what I'm interested in. Anybody here use the serum or scrub? I highly doubt I'll buy anything, but I'm curious to see if it isn't just a junk line. \n\nAs for the Neutrogena, I picked it up because I can never really find any AHA's around here, and I'm not interested in ordering from Paula's Choice. At $7, I figured I could give it a try. So far, I've used it about 4 times, and my skin doesn't seem to mind it. Maybe a little drying, but that could also just be my skin throwing a fit over the recent weather change. Any thoughts on it? I know it doesn't reduce the size of pores; that isn't what I'm interested in. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it to people whose skin is sensitive to fragrance, but mine is never affected by fragrances.\n\n\nIngredients:\n\nAqua Glycolic: \n>Water Purified, SD Alcohol 40B, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Eucalyptus Oil, FD&C Green 3\n\nNip+ Fab Glycolic Fix Serum:\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Limonene, Parfum (Fragrance), Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Benzoate, Pistacia Lentiscus (Mastic) Gum, Lecithin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Geraniol, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Linalool, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract\n\nNip + Fab Glycolic Fix Scrub: \n>Aqua (Water), Triethanolamine, Polyethylene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycolic Acid, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Xanthan Gum, Limonene, Parfum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Salicylic Acid, Benzyl Benzoate, Trideceth-6, Dehydroacetic Acid, Geraniol, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Citral, Linalool, CI 42090 (Blue No. 1)\n\nNeutrogena: \n>water, sodium laureth sulfate, glycerin, cocamidopropyl betaine, methyl gluceth-20, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, PEG-120 methyl glucose dioleate, salicylic acid, sodium chloride, benzyl alcohol, glycolic acid, fragrance, sodium hydroxide, polyquaternium-10, BHT, benzophenone-4, polyquaternium-7, ext. violet 2, blue 1",

That makes it excellent for both curls and color, but it may not be enough for you in terms of cleaning your hair and scalp.\n\nThe Love for Hue and Curl Defining shampoos are actually pretty similar in that they both use very mild detergents. This would be good for both color and curls and sufficient for cleansing unless you have a lot of buildup or certain scalp conditions. It would be a little harsher on hair than the kinky moves, but a lot of people can't cowash.\n\nIf you can't cowash, try alternating cowashing with low poo (both the curl defining and love for hue shampoos are low poos). That will help keep your color fresh and your curls moisturized.",

In addition to  the baseline visit (Day 0), subjects visited the clinic for two  follow-up visits at Days 14 and 28 and for a final visit at Day 42.

In addition, the patients expressed a high degree of satisfaction with  the treatment. No adverse events were reported during this study. **Conclusion:**  The study showed that after six weeks of treatment, the face cream  provided improvement in Investigator Static Global Assessment, pruritus,  desquamation, induration, and erythema.\n\nHas anybody already tried their product?\n\nIngredients: [https://www.kamedis-eu.com/products/sebo-dandruff-shampoo](https://www.kamedis-eu.com/products/sebo-dandruff-shampoo)\n\n>Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Water(Aqua), Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate,  Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Zinc Pyrithione,  **Sapindus Mukurossi Fruit Extract**, Salicylic Acid, **Indigofera Tinctoria  Extract**, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate,  Triethanolamine, Fragrance (Perfume).\n\nSo there's Zinc pyrithione and salicylic acid but in addition some herbal extracts like the Sapindus and the Indigofera.",

Seriously?\n\n*Contains Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate and Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Lauramine Oxide, Lactic Acid 88%, Polyquaternium-10, Methyl Cluceth-10, Sodium Choloride, Citric Acid, Hydrolized Yeast Protein, Sodium PCA, Panthenol, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA Copper, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Beta Glucan, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf/Twig Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat), Germ Protein, Ginkgo Blloba Leaf Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Tetra Sodium EDTA*\n\n* The facial mask that's made of clay contains:\n\n*Kaolin, Bentonite, Glycerin, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Propylene Glycol, Green Mud (Clay), Grapeseed Extract, Chamomile Extract, Calendula Extract, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Bulyl Carbamate, Zinc Oxide.*\n\nThe burning from it subsides after about 3 minutes. The gel cleanser burns the entire fucking time it's on and will burn hours after I've washed it off.\n\nThank you if you can help me!\n",

        "body": "One of the most important rules of skincare: if it burns, it's probably not helping your skin! (With a couple exceptions, such as high strength acid peels, but this is not the case here)\n\nIf you're looking to use an acid, introduce it slowly, especially if you've never used them before! It's also best to only introduce one product at a time, so if you react positively or negatively, you know which product did it. \n\nOftentimes when you have sensitive or burning skin, it's because your skin is dehydrated. My recommendations would include using a really hydrating gel or cream moisturiser. I'd also say stop the acid products you're using, because skincare shouldn't have to be painful! Keep in mind that your products may have also gone off, particularly if you've had them for a few years. Check the expiration dates. \n\nPersonally, I use Cosrx Blackhead Power Liquid as a BHA and I've never had any problems with burning while using it. \n\nFor more helpful suggestions, I'd recommend detailing the rest of your routine.",

Those products are old and likely expired so they could be doing more harm than good.\n\nOn top of that exfoliants need to be at a correct ph so unless it's one of the recommended products on here or listed on the bottle you'd have to test it yourself. You want it between 3-4 but most product don't actually have the correct ph.\n\nExfoliants can sting a little when you start them but they should be painful. Rinse it off ASAP if it stings too much. You should also start slowly, with once or twice a week. Over exfoliation can cause irritation and a damaged moisture barrier which will just make things worse.",

        "body": "I'm not a cosmetic chemist, but I have a PhD in chemistry, so here are my two cents. It seems like there are many problems with this formulation, but proper processing could solve some of them. I would like to know more about \n\n1. Most glaringly, silicone oils aren't super compatible with a lot of anionic surfactants (not due to charge, but due to polarity), where they're unable to emulsify highly hydrophobic oils like dimethicone. Most would suggest a water-dispersible silicone like amodimethicone. Alternatively, you can use using a PEGylated silicone-based co-emulsifier like PEG-10 dimethicone.\n2. Using a cationic rheology modifier with an anionic surfactant system. These will naturally attract one another and will condense together, reducing the viscosity. Use a nonionic or anionic rheology modifier for this system; there are so many to choose from.\n3. The high ionic strength environment of the system will hamper the rheology modifier's ability to thicken liquid (as it's ionic), and it will reduce foaming in your system. You usually would rely on high ionic strength systems for w/o emulsions, not for surfactant-only systems or highly polar systems (o/w emulsions).\n4. The salt is also probably causing salting out of surfactants as well, causing multiple layers to form. Usually, increasing ionic strength can decrease ionic surfactant monomer concentrations and push pre-micellar aggregates and micelle formation. This should, in theory, lead to a decreased CMC, which can improve foaming. However, with decreased CMC, you can also cause micelles to fuse to form worm-like structures/rods that increase viscosity ([work with SDS](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01558)). This increase may be negligible compared to the high viscosities wanted for shampoos and the like.\n5. The zwitterionic surfactants (like CAPB) will also be affected by salts, but in a different way. Higher ionic strengths will increase CMC and reduce surface tension, which can lead to poor foaming. Salt also causes transitions in zwitterionic surfactants from micelles to rod-like or worm-like shapes, which do increase viscosity, but that will reduce foaming ([work with CAPB](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c01558)).\n\nIn essence, I think you're working with the perfect concoction of wrong things. I would remove the salt first and foremost, and think about keeping the active surfactant matter around 20 wt%. Much higher and you're just throwing away money without benefit. A lot of on-the-market 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioners simply rely on soluble silicones to do most of the work without actual conditioning. These two products are necessarily oppositely charged, so I usually recommend people just use two products.",
