Sodium citrate is the best known of a few different ingredients known as melting salts, which facilitate the melting of old or stubborn cheeses. It’s a white powder with a salty-sour taste, but in cheese, its taste isn’t noticeable. The tight-knit proteins that hinder smooth melting are bonded to each other with the help of calcium ions. When you warm up a mixture of cheese with the addition of liquid and a small amount of sodium citrate, the sodium substitutes itself for some of the calcium that’s helping the proteins cling. As the cheese is heated, the proteins separate from each other and again act as emulsifiers, strengthening the emulsion by holding fat and water together.*\n\nI love how detailed the science is behind making nacho cheese so smooth.

The ratio of liquid to cheese (in weight) determines your melting point. You will find it is mostly trial and error depending on if you use hard or soft cheese(moisture content dependent) as to where the melting point goes. Higher % liquid means lower melting point and vice versa. \n\nDone by weight and using the weight of the cheese as your reference, the ratio for sodium citrate remains the same. \n\n100% weight of cheese\n4% weight of sodium citrate\n87% milk \n\nUsing those ratios, at 165 degrees (F) and with 4 parts sharp cheddar to 1 part smoked gouda, you will have perfectly liquid cheese sauce.  \n\nTo prepare it, add the citrate to your liquid in a pot, bring to a boil, add cheese and whisk or blend using a hand blender for best results, until temperature reaches 165 degrees and cheese lumps disappear.  Cool and reheat like velveeta or keep warm for serving. \n\nYou can use it to make your own softer loafs of hard cheese or cheese sauce. Super cool stuff!\n\nEDIT: I would shred the cheese before making your sauce, makes the integration much easier. The citrate binds fat to protein around water molecules.",

It is not suitable for charcuterie, obviously, but it has it's place. It is perfectly melty.",

I did not put any packaged pre-shredded cheeses as I know those have a lot of anti-caking agents, which may result in grainy cheese.\n\nWhen I finished this batch fresh, it's perfectly creamy and luscious, as expected. However, after I put it in the refrigerator and microwave it to eat, it's not creamy anymore. But a little clumpy like how cheese behaves when cold. \n\nMy favorite store-bought Mac N Cheese is Panera's white cheddar from Costco, and theirs is still perfectly creamy and luscious, even after being in the refrigerator and after microwaving. \n\nWhat do I need to do to keep it creamy? More bechamel sauce, less square cheeses? More sodium citrate? I don't know! ",

    "body": "MY NEW VERSION OF THIS PROCESS IS LOCATED HERE: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/avme9u/how_to_make_salt_and_vinegar_seasoning_updated/\n\nI am a huge fan of salt and vinegar chips. It has been my favorite go to snack every sense I was a kid. But yet I always wondered how the seasoning was made so when I dug down and did a little research I found out how industry produces the seasoning and modified the process to replicate at home. This seasoning produced in this recipe is very vinegary and worth the time involved making it!\n\nBefore we get started I just want to make clear that this process is still experimental and I am still playing around with it. Once I figure out a better way of producing it I will post it. \n\nSo to start we all know the main chemical used as the flavoring agent in Salt and Vinegar seasoning is Sodium Diacetate and industrially it is made by combing Sodium Hydroxide (Lye) with Glacial Acetic Acid (99% Pure Vinegar) to form Sodium Acetate. Then more Glacial Acidic acid is added to lock in the acidic flavor and convert the chemical over to Sodium Diacetate.\n\nBut for my process we will be using Vinegar instead of Glacial Acetic Acid, Baking Soda instead of Lye, and Citric Acid in replacement of the acetic acid. The addition of the citric acid will be explained later in the recipe.\n\nThis home version (in theory) produces Sodium Diacetate along with a small amount of Sodium Citrate without using dangerous industrial chemicals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW MAKE SALT AND VINEGAR SEASONING**\n\n1. Add **2.4L** of White Distilled Vinegar to a large pot.\n2. Add **100g** of Baking Soda to the vinegar **IN SMALL AMOUNTS!** After the solution has finished bubbling, heat the solution to 160F for 1 hour to ensure the reaction has completed.\n3. Evaporate the solution by boiling it down to about **1/10** of its original volume (or more) until you see crystals start to form at the top of the liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *During the evaporation process you will begin to see crystals forming on the side of the pot as well. Collect a small portion of these from the pot and set them aside to use as seed crystals for the crystallization process.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*4.* After boiling down the liquid transfer it to a clean beaker and cool the liquid in an ice bath. When the solution has cooled down to room temperature take a seed crystal and drop it into the solution. (You should immediately see the liquid start to crystallize).\n\n5. Transfer the newly formed Sodium Acetate crystals to some coffee filters and Allow it to dry. After drying the Sodium Acetate grind it into a fine powder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***(PART 2)*** **Making Salt and Vinegar Seasoning:**\n\n1. Add **140g** of Sodium Acetate to a beaker.\n2. Add **21g** of Sea Salt to the mixture along with **12g** of Corn Starch and combine well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The Corn Starch is added to prevent the seasoning from clumping after drying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Next add **24-27g** of Citric Acid ***(This step converts (some) of the sodium acetate back to acetic acid)***. Stir the powders until the powder starts to clump up and becomes a wet slimy paste.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***NOTE:*** *The powder will clump together and become wet due to acetic acid forming thus combining with the left over unconverted sodium acetate. The powder is now comprised of both Sodium Acetate and Acetic Acid and possibly a little harmless sodium citrate. Which in theory is our desired sodium diacetate product. I have come up with this hypothesis because sodium diacetate is a combination of sodium acetate and acetic acid which is just what we have created.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Transfer the wet powder to a coffee filter and allow it to dry. Then grind the seasoning into a fine powder.\n\n5. Place the seasoning inside a clean container with a lid and store in a cool dry place and enjoy!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***This recipe can be scaled up or down to meet requirements.***",

        "body": "Great post, but I have a question or two. \n\nSodium diacetate is the half neutralization of acetic acid by a sodium base, so I'm wondering why you went with citric acid when you could have just used 2:1 moles of vinegar:baking soda?  \n\nWith store bought vinegar at 5% acetic acid, you'd need 2402g to get 2 moles, or if you're measuring by volume, 2388mL.  1 mole of sodium bicarbonate is 84g, so with your 100g, you're pretty much 90% there considering the baking soda probably has some sort of moisture content from ambient humidity.\n\nThe citric acid is an interesting addition.  It looks to me like you'd get a mix of mostly sodium diacetate with some sodium acetate in your initial reaction.  Adding the sea salt and corn starch aren't relevant to the reaction.  Adding the citric acid won't participate in the reaction either since the baking soda will be used up in the initial reaction.  If the citric acid were to be neutralized, you'd get sodium citrate, not another acetate.\n\nYou're spot on with the distilled vinegar though.  I've tried making sodium diacetate using baking soda and 12% industrial vinegar before.  The residual alcohols make the pre-crystalized blob brown and gave the powder an off flavor.",

You have restaurant-style queso!\n\nI thought it was super cool, easy and delicious, and i thought queso without process cheese was impossible, so I wanted to share!\n\nEdit: most of the commenters be hatin but I got over 600 upvotes over 24 hours after my post. So IDC. Bitch away.",

It mainly means they add extra whey and emulsifiers, and to your point sodium citrate. So if those things freak you out, read your packaging.\n\n\nAlso, fun fact: The process of using these additives with mixtures of other cheese to make \"processed\" cheese was invented in Switzerland.",

    "body": "Linus, I need you to understand something. This isn’t just some spicy Reddit thread. This is serious. The latest controversy, centered around trust of all things, is frankly disturbing—but not for the reason you think. See, this isn’t really about trust. It’s about your total inability to appreciate the nuanced complexity of cheese.\n\nYes, Linus. Cheese.\n\nYou keep acting like trust is the main concern, but no one’s tuning into the WAN show wondering if you’re emotionally reliable—they’re wondering what cheese you put on your goddamn burger. And every time you call processed cheese “fake” or “plastic,” you’re not just insulting a food group. You’re spitting in the face of meltability science.\n\nProcessed cheese is engineered perfection. It’s not about artisanal smugness—it’s about emulsification, stability, and glorious, gooey consistency. But you? You keep doubling down with that smug slice of aged cheddar, as if that crumbly mess melting off the side of a patty is something to be proud of.\n\nWe’re not angry because we don’t trust you, Linus. We’re angry because you don't trust cheese. You reject the smooth embrace of science and sodium citrate and instead cling to anecdotal dairy elitism. And then you have the audacity to send your team cheese photos like it’s some kind of dairy mic drop? Come on.\n\nLuke usually reels you in, but this time? “People are insane if they care about cheese”? No, Luke. What’s insane is ignoring culinary truth in favor of tastebud nostalgia. It’s unhinged. It’s reckless. It’s ungrated.\n\nNo one’s saying you have to like Kraft Singles. But don’t pretend that your personal cheese trauma invalidates an entire category of thermodynamically optimized dairy. Processed cheese isn’t just real—it’s superior for the specific use case you’re wrongly dunking on.\n\nYou’re not being canceled, Linus. You’re being asked to respect the melt.\n\nTLDR: This isn’t about trust. It’s about Linus disrespecting cheese, ignoring decades of food science, and choosing ego over emulsifiers. Fix it. Apologize to the cheddar, and maybe—maybe—we’ll trust you again.\n\nEdit: It's 4am and I my brain no work. This is ChatGPT slop btw, I'm not funny/bothered enough rn to write a shitpost worthy of the original so whatever this says will have to do. Don't upvote this to prove humanity is better than garbo computer generation.\n\nEdit: She macin' on my cheese 'til I gouda. There you can upvote the post for that masterful comedy. 🧀🧀\n\nEdit: Jokes on you all, this way a drinking game on how many people I could get to say cheese, I'm now absolutely sloshed 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀\n\nEdit: please stop cheese posting, my drinking game has taken a nasty turn and now I owe my local cheesemonger a sack of pennies by nightfall or there'll be hell to pay\n\nEdit: I don't think people got the point of this post is that you all sound dumb as hell arguing about cheese",

Like, I'm not going to use a block of sharp, aged, crusty ass dry cheddar to top a burger or make mac n cheese or a grilled cheese sandwich with. Sure, it'll visibly melt, but it doesn't taste melted, and often gets oily and grainy (unless you add an emulcifying agent in a cheese sauce). A toasted sandwich with provolone will still feel like the provolone is solid and will pull not too dissimilarly to mozzarella, albeit not to the same extent. That isn't to say these might not be desirable at times, but to write off an entire type of cheese all because the cheapest, most readily available brands are gross and taste fake is a spicy take that deserves the hate.\n\nAlso, the amount of people that don't understand the difference between Kraft \"plastic\" cheese and good American Cheese from the likes of Boar's Head or Land o' Lakes etc. is staggering. There are good American cheeses out there. They just will cost more, like your cheddars, colby jacks, provolones, etc., and they don't come individually wrapped. If you're not finding them, then get out of the packaged cheese isle and go to your grocer's deli counter.",

    "body": "I got bored yesterday and decided to try making an [American cheese version of Pecorino Romano.](https://imgur.com/a/3SOz2cg) Here are the ingredients:\n\n300 g Grated Locatelli Pecorino Romano  \n140 g Whole Milk  \n9 g Sodium Citrate  \n2 g Sodium Hexametaphosphate  \n1.5 g Kosher Salt  \n\nThe process was really simple. Add the milk, sodium citrate, salt, and sodium hexametaphosphate, to a sauce pan and warm it up. Add the cheese little by little until it melts. It will look like it's going to be a shaggy broken mess until you heat it to about 150 - 160 F. At this point it will resemble kneaded mozzarella curd. The last step is to put into a plastic wrap lined mold and let it cool.\n\nIt tastes exactly like Pecorino Romano, but melts like American cheese, and was great on a burger. All of my Italian ancestors are probably cursing my name, but it was worth it.\n\n[Here's a quick progress video of some burgers I made with it.](https://imgur.com/a/N1ghOlE)",

Obviously the cheat a cheat would be using  “extra/ultra-melt” (government cheese). You just have to melt that shit into milk and be done with it. No roux needed.",

    "body": "EDIT: Guys, huge important thing that I want to put up here. We recently found out (9/12/18) that the Chinese baker's ammonium - choufen - is roughly half ammonium bicarbonate and half baking soda. If you're working with pure ammonium bicarbonate (i.e. baker's ammonia in the West) instead of that 4g Chinese baker's ammonium go with 2g ammonium bicarbonate and 2g baking soda.\n\nWe've had a couple people that live in the USA/Europe report an extremely intense ammonium smell from their buns... we believe this is likely the reason, as we've had reports of successes from people Hong Kong and Singapore-based.\n\n____________________________________\n\nSo we wanted to teach you how to make the proper Dim Sum-style steamed Char Siu Bao. For the unaware, Char Siu Bao is a bit of a special Baozi – it has this characteristic super fluffy texture that’s really unlike any other Baozi out there.\n\nThe story goes that when Dim Sum was really blowing up in Guangzhou in the 1910s, a Cantonese chef went to the West and brought back some Western leavening agents. He combined this with a traditional Chinese sourdough Baozi dough to create something with a new and completely unique texture. As such, to arrive at that classic Char Siu Bao, it’s critical to have (1) a natural (i.e. without yeast) sourdough starter and (2) a leavening agent called baker’s ammonium. \n\nThe use of baker’s ammonium here is sort of fascinating time capsule, as it was a popular ingredient in turn-of-the-century Europe. While it’s not common, it *is* around, primarily used in old-school North European recipes like Swedish Tunnbrod or German Lebkuchen.\n\n[Video is here if you’d like a visual to follow along](https://youtu.be/lj5GJP_i55o).\n\nThe way I’ll organize this is to split it up into its component parts: how to make the mother dough, how to make the starter dough, how to make the filling, and finally how to make the final dough/wrap/steam the Baozi.\n\n######How to Make the Char Siu Bao mother dough\n\nHopefully this doesn’t all get too confusing. We made [baker’s schedule](https://i.imgur.com/u72vrqc.png) to follow if you’d rather (sometime I’ll get around to making that less ugly, I hope). If you’re already familiar with sourdoughs, this’s basically a bog standard 2:1 flour-to-water sourdough starter.\n\nAlso, I have to be frank with you and say that I’m not sure what the proper nomenclature is here. We’re fermenting a dough for a while (which I’ve labeled the “Mother dough”), then mixing some of that and fermenting it again overnight (which I’ve labeled the “Starter dough”), then using some of *that* in our final dough.\n\n**Ingredients, Mother Dough:**\n\n1.\t*All purpose flour (全用面粉), 40g per feeding, 160g total.*\n\n2.\t*Water, 20g per feeding, 80g total.* \n\n**Process, Mother Dough:**\n\nThis is all assuming you’re starting in the morning. Of course, you can start whenever the hell you want, just adjust the times :)\n\n1.\t*Day 1, 8am: Mix 40g flour and 20g water.* Combine well, get into a bit of a ‘ball’.  Loosely cover with plastic wrap and put in a warm, dry place to ferment.\n\n2.\t*Day 2, 8am: Add in another 40g flour and 20g water.* Same deal. Combine well, put back in that warm dry place. \n\n3.\t*Day 2, 8pm: Add in another 40g flour and 20g water.* Ditto.\n\n4.\t*Day 3, 8am: Add in another 40g flour and 20g water.* \n\n5.\t*Day 3, 8pm.* Mother dough finished. It should be much more liquidy than before, have a few little bubbles in it, and smell a bit sour.\n\n ######How to Make the Char Siu Bao starter dough\n\nIf you happen to already have some sourdough mother dough lying around, feel free to pick up here.\n\n**Ingredients, Starter dough:**\n\n1.\t*Char Siu Bao Mother Dough, 40g.* You’ll have some extra. The dough can keep or freeze if you reactivate it (instructions in the bakers schedule above and the notes below). Seeing as many Western sourdough starters work off the same ratio, you could also cross-purpose this stuff.\n\n2.\t*Water, 80g.*\n\n3.\t*Cake Flour (低筋面粉) -or- Baozi Flour, 160g.* We actually used cake flour in our tests to help ensure replicability, but either flour works great. For reference, our cake flour was 8.3% protein.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1.\t*Day 3, 10-12pm: Mix together the above ingredients, then knead until smooth.* Kneading for roughly three minutes in the container should be fine. Draw a little line on your container to keep track of your progress.\n\n2.\t*Day 4, 6-8am: Starter Dough (should be) finished.* You’re looking for this to roughly double in size.\n\n######How to Make Char Siu Bao Filling\n\nChar Siu Bao filling relies on a sauce called “Char Siu Bao sauce”, which perhaps confusingly is **completely different** than “Char Siu sauce”. The latter’s basically a wet rub to cook Char Siu barbecue pork (made from a combination of Lushui spiced ‘master stock’, mianchi/red miso, maltose and a few other ingredients) while the former’s a sort of mother sauce used in a few different Dim Sum dishes.\n\nThis uses a handful of ingredients that’d you’d have to pick up from a Chinese supermarket, but I figure that if you’re attempting to make Char Siu Bao from scratch you’re probably in the mood to go all out anyway.\n\n**Ingredients, Char Siu Bao sauce:**\n\nAt the risk of confusing the hell out of you once again, this recipe makes a whole jar of Char Siu Bao sauce, of which you’ll use 135 grams. Make any less and the quantities just start getting really small and goofy. \n\nIt also uses scallion oil, an ingredient that you got to make yourself. Dead easy to whip up, I’ll give a brief description of how to make it below… but if you want something a bit more detailed feel free to check out [our post on scallion oil noodles](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/7nm3sc/recipe_scallion_oil_noodles_shanghaistyle_%E8%91%B1%E6%B2%B9%E6%8B%8C%E9%9D%A2/).\n\n1.\t*Light soy sauce (生抽), 1 tbsp.*\n\n2.\t*Dark soy sauce (老抽), 1 tsp.*\n\n3.\t*Chu Hou paste (柱候酱) -or- Hoisin sauce (海鲜酱), ½ tsp.* So Chu Hou paste is a sort of spiced fermented soybean paste. It’s more traditional here, but Hoisin is also a sort of spiced fermented soybean paste and hits a lot of the same notes. For this small amount, I wouldn’t go out and buy a whole jar of Chu Hou… use Hoisin if it’s more convenient.\n\n4.\t*Oyster sauce (蚝油), 1.5 tbsp.*\n\n5.\t*Sugar, 3.5 tbsp.*\n\n6.\t*Salt, ¼ tsp.*\n\n7.\t*Toasted sesame oil, (麻油), ½ tbsp.*\n\n8.\t*Water, 1/3 cup.*\n\n9.\t*Scallion oil, 1 tbsp mixed in with all the above ingredients, 1 tbsp to finish.* So to make scallion oil, take the white part of 12 scallions and ¼ of a white onion and toss it in 1 cup of peanut oil. Put the oil and the onions over medium high heat until it starts to bubble, then swap the flame to medium low.  Cook for ~8 minutes until the onions begin to get all golden brown, take them oil, and strain the oil. Now, what I just told you yields way more than two tablespoons… but scallion oil’s awesome, great ingredient to toss in a quick noodle or whathaveyou. It keeps real well, I’m sure you’ll find a way to consume the excess.\n\n10.\t*MSG (味精), a small sprinkle.* Like, less than 1/8 of a teaspoon. Members of the rabid anti-MSG crowd, feel free to skip it. This will be added near the end of cooking, as the ideal temperature for MSG to dissolve is 70-90C.\n\n11.\t*Slurry for Char Siu Bao sauce: ¼ cup water, 1 tbsp cornstarch (生粉), 1 tbsp cake flour (低筋面粉), 1 tbsp mungbean flour (绿豆粉).* So Char Siu Bao sauce has a bit of a special slurry, containing both cake and mungbean flour in addition to the standard cornstarch. The mungbean flour in particular makes the sauce ‘gooey’ after cooking – if you just used straight cornstarch you’d get a ‘goopier’ consistency. If you can’t find mungbean flour, you could use a straight-up half/half mix between cornstarch and cake flour, but you might find the texture of the filling slightly lacking (though I do wonder if a small sprinkle of sodium citrate could serve the same function… that’d obviously be radically experimental however).\n\n**Process, Char Siu Bao sauce:**\n\n1.\t*Make the slurry.* Combine the water, cornstarch, cake flour, and mungbean flour. Anyone familiar with slurries knows that flour doesn’t play nice with water, so really do a bang up job mixing those until no more clumps remain. Set aside.\n\n2.\t*Toss together the first eight ingredients above and half (i.e. one tablespoon) of the scallion oil. Combine over low heat.* Once the sugar’s dissolved, you’re good to move on.\n\n3.\t*Give the slurry one final paranoid stir, then toss it in the pot with everything else. Stir constantly for three minutes until thickened.* Really keep this moving, be careful not to burn it. It’s going to end up really quite thick, this is normal.\n\n4.\t*Shut off the heat, add in the MSG. Once dissolved, add in the scallion oil. Jar it up.*\n\n5.\t*Let the sauce cool for at least three hours in the fridge, or up to… whenever.* This needs to cool down completely – luckily, this stuff keeps real well (like, months, provided your jar’s sterilized), so it can be made well in advance.\n\n**Ingredients, Char Siu Bao Filling:**\n\n1.\t*Char Siu (叉烧), 35g.* Apparently, in the time since I’ve left the States, they’ve even started selling this in some Western supermarket chains. Awesome. We used some from a local restaurant, and obviously homemade’s great as well.\n\n2.\t*Char Siu Bao sauce, from above, 135g.* Again, apologies for the excess here. Our amateurishness re recipe testing’s starting to peek through I suppose.\n\n**Process, Char Siu Bao Filling:**\n\n1.\t*Thinly Slice the Char Siu Pork.*  Keyword: thin. Some people dice it, but either way you’re looking for it as thin as you can.\n\n2.\t*Mix the sliced Char Siu in with the chilled Char Siu Bao sauce.* Given that the sauce has solidified, this is a little move involved than you might think at first glance. Just stir it around for a few minutes so that everything’s incorporated all even.\n\n3.\t*Keep in the Fridge until you’re ready to wrap the Baozi.*\n\n######How to Make the Final Dough, How to Wrap and Steam the Baozi \n\n**Ingredients, Final Dough:**\n\n1.\t*Starter Dough from Above, 200g.*\n\n2.\t*Sugar, 75g.*\n\n3.\t*Water, 15g.*\n\n4.\t*Chinese Baker's Ammonia (臭粉), 4g -or- Ammonium Bicarbonate, 2g with Baking Soda, 2g.* This is going to make the Baozi spread, puff, and crack.\n\n5.\t*Cake Flour (低筋面粉), 90g.* \n\n6.\t*Baking Powder (泡打粉), 12g.* This’ll give the Baozi some rise. Here’s the thing with baking powders though – different brands have a slightly different mix of leavening agents. It’s not the most important variable in the world, but the brand we liked the most – and what this recipe is based off of – is “Rumford”. Super common brand abroad, so just use that if you can.\n\n7.\t*Cream of Tartar (塔塔粉), 2g.* So the addition of cream of tartar was our slight addition here. If you’re unaware, cream of tartar is sort of like the acid equivalent of baking soda, so it can help balance our super-alkaline ammonium. A common problem with (proper) homemade Char Siu Bao is overly alkaline dough, which can lend an ugly yellowish tint after steaming. Most Dim Sum restaurants won’t use this, but they also have a mother dough that they keep for ages (like, one joint in North Point in Hong Kong has a 63 year old starter). During testing - after the nth time we got yellowish Baozi - we added a touch on a whim and it completely fixed the color problem.\n\n8.\t*Lard (猪油) -or- Vegetable Shortening, 8g.* Lard’s ever so slightly tastier, but shortening also totally works.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1.\t*Mix together the starter, sugar, and water.* After a couple minutes of mixing, the sugar will ‘melt’ into the dough and it should be more liquid-y. \n\n2.\t*Add in the ammonium bicarbonate, and mix well.* We’re waiting under after things are melted to add in the ammonium bicarbonate because it’s really important that the ammonium’s mixed in real evenly. Mix for another minute or so.\n\n3.\t*Smell the dough.* The first time you make this, you won’t totally know what you’re looking for here, but it’s a good habit to get into. Ammonium has a very distinct smell – you’re looking for a balance between that and the sourness of the starter dough.\n\n4.\t*Sift together the cake flour, the baking powder, and the cream of tartar… then pour in with the dough. Knead for ~6 minutes until smooth.* Be careful not to over-knead the dough, you’re just looking for the dough to come together and stop sticking.  At this stage, smack the dough and see what it sounds like. If the sound sort of reverberates like a drum, you’re good to go. If it sounds dull and heavy, that means there’s not enough tiny little holes in it, and that the dough was too alkaline. Conversely, if it sounds sort of like a ‘smack’, that means that there’s too many little holes in the dough from the fermentation, and that the dough is overly acidic. Again, the first time you make this you won’t know precisely what you’re looking for, but it’ll help you troubleshoot any issues later on.\n\n5.\t*Add in the lard, knead for ~2 minutes until combined.*\n\n6.\t*Place the dough on a silpat or lightly floured smooth surface. Roll it out until roughly 40 cm by 30 cm. Then roll it up length-wise, tightly, into a sort of ‘log shape’. Curl it up, then let the dough relax for one hour.* So it’s always difficult for me to explain working with dough, so if anything’s confusing just [jump to 5:16 in the video](https://youtu.be/lj5GJP_i55o?t=5m17s) for a clearer visual.\n\n7.\t*Cut the dough into 40g pieces.* You should have ten, for ten Baozi.\n\n8.\t*Roll out the Baozi wrappers.* If you already know how to roll a dumpling wrapper, you already know how to roll these. Starting with the rolling pin flat on the cutting board, roll inwards, then back out. Twist the wrapper ~10 degrees, then do the same. Because this’s a Baozi, these wrappers’ll be a bit thicker than a dumpling obviously, about 3mm.\n\n9.\t*Stuff the Baozi with the Char Siu Pork mixture.* Place 15g of the filling in the center of the Baozi wrapper, then pinch one side of it. From the pinch, pleat around the Baozi in a circular motion – pressing at the top while slightly pressing the filling downward.  Once you get to the end, pinch everything closed, then twist the end up and around. Press with force and pinch at the top of the Baozi to make sure everything’s all sealed. (I’m sure that explanation sucked, please check the visual if you’re planning to make this…)\n\n10.\t*Place the Baozi in a steamer, on top of some small cut out some pieces of parchment paper.* Without the parchment paper, the Baozi would stick to the steamer.\n\n11.\t*Get a large pot of water to a rapid boil, optionally adding a splash of vinegar in.* The vinegar is sort of a last ditch paranoid thing to ensure the color doesn’t come out all yellow and muffed up. If your dough was ever so slightly too alkaline, the vinegar will help keep in white.  Because we’re super paranoid, we added ½ tbsp vinegar essence (20% acetic acid).\n\n12.\t*Place the steamer in your large pot, cover, seal the cover with a couple damp towels, and let it steam for 10 minutes.* So Dim Sum restaurants often have these special pressurized steamers that get real hot and can do the job in about five minutes. Char Siu Bao crave high heat. At home, the best we can do is make sure things are sealed up real tight – if you have things going at full blast and don’t have much steam escaping, you should be completely fine.\n\n13.\t*Enjoy a well deserved Char Siu Bao.*",

    "body": "This has been a long journey. It all started with a brunch at a neighbor's house, where I brought a Macaroni and Cheese casserole as a side dish and was very disappointed in how it turned out. So embarrassed that I decided to throw out everything I thought I knew about M&C, start fresh and examine every aspect of the recipe. Some improvements were easy; I switched from regular elbows to jumbo and that was an improvement. Other aspects were more difficult, but more on that in a bit. In the past few weeks I have made at least 11 different versions, changing variables each time, but by far the biggest breakthrough moment was reading about, ordering and trying an emulsifier called Sodium Citrate.\n\nI'm sure I've lost some of you right there, but I urge you to keep reading, because what this stuff does to cheese is nothing short of amazing. I read it about it first here on Reddit; Redditor PartyatGatsbys has a great thread on it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/3x0ymk/scientific_mac_n_cheese_596_x_599/\nThat thread led to Youtube videos, ordering some on Amazon and finally trying it for myself. It is a game changer because of the problem it solves.\n\nCheese sauces are difficult because they tend to break. Proteins and oils separate, on one extreme you end up with liquid and a big glob of goo. So 99% of the recipes out there call for making a béchamel sauce, and adding cheese to make it a mornay. This is perfectly fine for a stovetop Macaroni and cheese, or a cheese sauce for vegetables, but I could never get it to taste the way I wanted in a baked dish. The béchamel of course starts with a blonde roux - flour and butter mixed and cooked together. The longer it cooks the darker it gets. At the most blonde stage it has the most thickening ability, and the most starchy flavor. This is what most M&C recipes call for. Its foolproof, and it makes a smooth cheese sauce, but its not without problems. When baked it gets pasty, starchy and, in my opinion, gross.\n\nWhat to do? The route I initially took was to try a fondue recipe for the cheese sauce. You take a dry white wine, heat it up and slowly add shredded cheese that has been tossed with corn starch. This is fairly foolproof, makes a really nice sauce and when used in a Macaroni and cheese, I think it is fantastic, but it is not traditional. You can taste the wine. Your kids might not like it. Purists won't like it.\n\nThat's where I was when I heard about Sodium Citrate. With this stuff, you can make a smooth sauce with just about any cheese, and it doesn't taste like béchamel. It doesn't get pasty; stays creamy. It will ruin you on béchamel. I got it on Amazon, I'm sure it is available other places.\n\nThis recipe makes 2 large individual servings. It should scale up fine, but I haven't tried that yet.\n\n* 2 cups water\n* 1 cup milk\n* 8 oz finely shredded cheese (I like a mix of cheddar and Jack)\n* 1 tsp Sodium Citrate\n* Bread crumbs\n* Seasonings (I like salt, white pepper, dry mustard and cayenne)\n* 8 oz jumbo macaroni\n\nHeat the milk and water to a simmer. Add the Sodium Citrate and mix. Slowly add the cheese, constantly stirring with a whisk. Wait until each batch is fully melted before adding more. Took me about 8 minutes. Hold back a little cheese for topping.\n\nThe resulting sauce should be very smooth, and seem quite soupy. This is OK, we're going to need that liquid to cook the pasta. There is no need to pre-cook the pasta; trust me - it will be perfectly tender when it cooks. \n\nDivide the pasta evenly between the two ramekins and the cover with the cheese sauce. Give each a stir to make sure the sauce reaches all the way to the bottom. \n\nFloat the remaining topping cheese and bread crumbs on the macaroni, and then bake at 375 degrees for 15 minutes.\n\nI hope you like it as much as I do!\n\nDoubled the recipe, made it in a dish and took pictures this time:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/Af3t1\n",

It caramelizes beautifully and adds a really satisfying crispness that crumbs alone just don't get. \n\nIf you wanna be extra fancy about it, get some pancetta or bacon, chop it up fine, and pan fry it till crispy.

After 35 minutes the shells were cooked and it was finally starting to firm up, though still quite soupy. But by then the sauce was kind of granular and curdled.

    "body": "This works with any kind of pasta - fusilli, penne, macaroni, angel hair, spaghetti, whatever. You can buy it in bulk, store brand, for pretty good prices, especially when it's on sale. Stock up if it goes on sale.\n\nThen you want deli American cheese, not the prepackaged stuff. Yes it matters, because yes it's different. (And better!)\n\nSalt the water and boil the pasta according to directions. I like mine on the firmer side so when the box says \"cooks in 10-12 minutes\" I pull it at 9-10 minutes. If it says 5-6 minutes (like angel hair) I pull it at 4 minutes or so, if the noodles are really pliable when I stir them. (Side note, most directions vastly overstate the amount of water you need. In general you want the pasta completely covered with at least an inch of water on top of it. You don't have to wait the 20 minutes it takes to boil four quarts of water for a box of spaghetti noodles. Use a large sauce pan and break them in half and then apply gentle pressure until they soften and are submerged, for example.)\n\nDrain into a colander but don't do a good job of it - you want some of that salted water in reserve, probably 2-3 tablespoons per serving you're cooking. Alternately you can just ladel some into a cup or bowl right before you strain the noodles. \n\nPut the noodles back in the pot with the water you saved (or that you didn't pour out) and and add 2-3 slices of cheese per serving, ripped into quarters or halves, and then stir until it's all melted and you have a cheese sauce. This takes approximately a minute or so, if you do it immediately. The residual heat on the noodles and the water you saved (immediately prior to straining) is enough to get the job done. It's that fast.\n\nThis doesn't sound like it would be good but it is phenomenal. You can also add grated parmesan or some other cheese if you want to fancy it up, but be aware that many 'harder' cheeses will not melt and emulsify well. Also shaker can parmesan (and anything pre-shredded in a bag) is treated with corn starch, which isn't really a problem for me but might be for some of you. (You want an emulsifier like sodium citrate or even good old mustard powder for some cheese, experiment if you want, and if you're really going all out you want to do this separately in a little sauce pan.)\n\nIf you use less water you can add a splash of milk, but it's not required.\n\nAdd salt and pepper, garlic, oregano or basil if you want. I sometimes add in a spoonful of basil pesto for a completely different experience.\n\nYou can get American cheese from the deli for $4-$6 per pound in most markets I'd imagine, or $8-$9 per pound for Boar's Head. I've never really counted slices but this is enough cheese for a good number of batches. It's a little more expensive than the prepackaged stuff but that's because it's actual cheese and not 'cheese product'. It's worth it. You can also use it on sandwiches and melts.\n\nIf no one watches you make this, they'll have no idea what you did and will assume you are a wizard when you say you didn't make it from a box, when in fact you got the idea from the cookingforbeginners subreddit.\n\nAdd peas and tuna for homemade tuna helper. Add steamed broccoli for noodles and broccoli in cheese sauce. Add browned ground beef and chili powder and some jalapenos or diced chipotles for chili mac.",

But if you've ever tried making queso with just sodium citrate, liquid, and cheese then you know that your options are either A. a sauce that's too runny when it's hot or B. a sauce that's too firm when it's room temperature. Store-bought queso doesn't have that problem, though. It's dippable both at room temperature and when heated up, so what gives? The answer is corn starch. I've found that adding just 3.5% of the weight of the cheese in corn starch is enough to get you a queso pretty much identical in consistency to the store-bought stuff. Perfectly dippable, whether hot or cold.\n\nThe general recipe I use is as follows:\n\n3 parts cheese to 2 parts liquid by weight\n\n2% of the total weight of cheese + liquid in sodium citrate\n\n3.5% of the weight of the cheese in corn starch\n\nThe cheese i use is usually a 50/50 mix of cheddar and pepperjack but you can absolutely use any cheese you want. I haven't tested using pre-shredded cheese yet though, so I'd stick to the block stuff for now. As far as the liquid goes, again anything is fair game. I usually use a mexican beer but milk would be more accurate to the store-bought version.\n\nOnce you have the ingredients all you do is put the liquid on medium heat on the stove, cut the cheese into smallish pieces (about 1 inch cubes for me), add the sodium citrate and corn starch to the cheese, and then add that mixture to the heating liquid and stir until it comes together. \n\nI promise you that this recipe produces the closest thing I've ever seen to the consistency of tostito's queso.",

Corn starch just allows the mixture to hold more liquid without going runny, which (when it's all dissolved together) compensates for the firmness that the milk fat adds.",

    "body": "My title is very clickbait-y and I'm going to justify it with both a really nice mac and cheese recipe and demonstration of a useful pasta technique. I sub starch in the pasta water for the flour in the roux, and it turns out way creamier and richer than you'd expect. A lot of us know to save our pasta water for red sauce, but it's also perfect for a creamy sauce as well. I personally discovered this through [Bon Appetit's Alfredo recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB6ZCkvg39k). I can't say much about how creamy it stays in the fridge, mainly because I never leave any leftovers. The best part is that the ingredients are everyday essentials, with no niche stuff like evaporated milk or sodium citrate or something. And it's better than all the other \"easy\" mac and cheese recipes out there. I actually regret learning how to do this because it's so addicting. It scales perfectly and everything can be eyeballed to make an amazing product. Here goes:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound pasta of your choosing (I'm obsessed with Garofalo-brand stuff which is really starchy, but cut it to a 1/2 pound because it expands so much lol)\n\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n\n* 8 ounces shredded cheese (good choices are cheddar or a blend with cheddar like 4-cheese or monterey jack)\n\n* 4 ounces parmesan (freshly grated is best but packaged works fine, adjust to how much you like parmesan or sub with other cheese)\n\n* 2 cups milk (add more butter for lower-fat milk)\n\n* 2 teaspoons mustard (Dijon or yellow)\n\n* Dash of cayenne or whatever spices you're feeling (optional)\n\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Boil and salt water for the pasta\n\n2. Cook the pasta al dente according to the box. Once finished, retain about a cup or so of pasta water and drain the rest\n\n3. Over medium-low heat, add the butter to the pasta water and stir in to combine\n\n4. Stir in the shredded cheese and parmesan to combine\n\n5. Stir in the milk to combine\n\n6. Stir in the mustard, spices, and seasoning to taste. Adjust proportions including milk and cheese to reach desired consistency\n\n7. Fold the pasta into the sauce and serve\n\nAnd that's about it. The first time I did this I also stirred in a sausage-jalapeno-mushroom-onion mixture and that tasted about as good as it sounds. The cheese sauce absorbs additional flavors super well and doesn't overwhelm other toppings. It's super versatile and can be easily personalized to everyone's mac preferences, and more importantly doesn't have a roux involved :P Jk, all mac and cheese is good mac and cheese, I just think this is a really convenient recipe to have around. If anyone tries it, tell me if it made up for the bad title ;)",

In what I think is fair to call a game-changing discovery, she realized that all you need to make perfect nacho or mac and cheese-type cheese sauce is non-aspirin Alka-Seltzer. No need to buy sodium citrate or lean on the usual starches. A realization like this is a once-in-a-very-rare-while event.

Be gentle <3\\\n\nAlso shoutout to [Adam Ragusea](https://youtu.be/KcM_MZoJWOo), who I've gotten multiple parts of my recipe from.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 10oz Sharp Cheddar (grated)\n\n* 6oz Cream Cheese (cubed)\n\n* 12oz Cavatappi Pasta\n\n* 1 cup of Heavy Cream\n\n* 1 cup of Milk\n\n* White Wine\n\n* Panko Breadcrumbs\n\n* Cayenne Pepper\n\n* Black (and White if you want, it's not neccesary though) Pepper\n\n* Smoked Paprika\n\n* Butter\n\n* 2 teaspoons of Sodium Citrate (THIS ONE ISN'T OPTIONAL)\n\n* Parm and Romano for flavoring\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Add pasta to boiling salt water, and cook it until it's slightly underdone. You'll be doing this part while you're doing everything else, so it's not a big deal\n\n2. Start on the sauce. You want to combine your milk and cream, and add a glug of white wine. Put this mixture on medium-low heat, and keep stirring it until it's warm. You don't want it to burn.\n\n3. Start toasting your panko. Add butter to a pan, and add panko to said pan on medium-high heat, cook and mix the panko until it's browned.\n\n4. Your sauce mixture should be warm by now, and ready for the magic. You wanna add that sodium citrate, and stir it up. Let it continue to cook for a little bit just to make sure it's all in there. \n\n5. Start mixing your cheddar into the sauce mixture. Put it in little by little until it's all melted. It should be a little bit thin right now, but far from watery Taste it, and if you want it to be more cheddar-ier, add more cheddar at this point.\n\n6. Add your blocks of cream cheese to the sauce. Mix it until the blocks have been made smaller, but are still there. The sauce should still be on the thinner side, but not watery.\n\n7. Add cayenne, smoked paprika, and your pepper to taste\n\n8. Get a 9x9 pan and smear butter onto it all. Get your hands dirty, just rub it in. You want the butter on the sides and the bottom of the pan, don't skimp on it.\n\n9. Add pasta to 9x9 pan\n\n10. Pour sauce over the pasta, and mix it all up\n\n11. Put the breadcrumbs on top of it all. Do this to your taste, I personally leave a lot of the cheese exposed because I love the crunch of the slightly burnt cheese, but that's just me.\n\n12. Leave it in during the preheating too, it makes it better. Don't know why, it just does.\nPut in oven at 425 degrees for 20-30 minutes, depending on how crispy you want it.\n\n13. Remove from the oven, and let rest for 5-10 minutes. If you don't do this, the sauce will just run away from the pasta once you take it out of the oven.\n\n14. Cut yourself a corner piece, and enjoy!",

Some cheeses lose a ton of flavor when heated up (cheddar being famous for this, and incidentally this is why I think it sucks melted on a burger, american ftw). But if you add sodium citrate, the cheese you use will melt nicely, as well as retain it's awesome unmelted flavor. So you can get really creative with the cheese mixes you use when making cheese sauce. An additional hack to add on top of this: If you don't want to buy the powder, you can add some american cheese slices (which are already packed with sodium citrate) into your sauce, and it will provide some of the effect of the powder itself.",

Of course, depending on the ratio of liquid to cheese, you can affect the thickness of the final sauce. So what if you used heavy cream, let it cool, and then tried to whip it in a mixture? Would it work? Obviously the liquid to cheese ratio would need to be enough so that the sauce was still thin and runny when cold.\n\nI don't even know what application I would want whipped cheese for, but would this be at all possible?

Egg yolk kills froth (pops the bubbles of whipped items) instantly. But the cream cheese seemed to make a little of it stay long enough to bake. \n\nFor your whipped cheese, I would cream some cream cheese in a stand mixer, add a little heavy cream to loosen it up, and then mix in cooled cheese sauce all with the paddle attachment. Then fold in already whipped cream. \n\nThe result would be a super spreadable cheese that would be good for bagels and breakfast sandwiches. Mix in bacon bits or pimento for variation. \n\nIf you want it to \"cut\" like a pie filling then you would need to add a little gelatin or corn starch.

So, my uneducated guess is that you can't whip hard cheeses for this reason.

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea?

Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\nI wanted to share some information on running nutrition. I have spent way too many hours googling this stuff and I think it can help the community save some money, as it has for me. I haven't been seriously running for long. I am SO far from elite. I do have a bit of a background in the chemical and food industry, so a lot of this was easy to make sense of. I thought I would compile some of the information I have so there is a centralized place to find it. If anyone has better recipes, better ideas, or anything to add - please feel free to.\n\nThese recipes could/would replace products like Maurten 320, Gu, Tailwind, Skratch, electrolytes, and post run recovery drinks. The following are just guides and can be modified to your desired sources of carbs, electrolytes, activity, and uses.\n\nI source all the ingredients through amazon. I prefer the brands Pure & Bulk Supplements. Their prices seem to be good, and shipping is prompt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Carbs**\n\nThis carb recipe is what I use. It's pretty much an exact replica of Maurten 320. Someone smarter than me designed it so I feel fine with it. If you desire a hydrogel type drink, then just mix 80g of it with 500ml of water and you will have Maurten 320. The hydrogel is backed by science, Joshua Rowe prior to his employment at Maurten tested this idea in a study and did prove its effectiveness. Other companies have claims against this actually having any improvement in carb uptake. I figure it can't hurt, so I include the gelling components. Additionally, I use this same base as a gel. So one carb mix allows me to decide what I want to use depending on the application/workout. I use a maltodextrin and fructose blend, because the maltodextrin isn't very sweet. Its palatable without being overly sweet. If you want to be even more cost effective, use straight up table sugar. It's a 1:1 ratio, versus a 1:0.8, so it would perform almost identically. You can also go 2:1 if you want even less sweetness by having a reduced fructose amount. Maltodextrin is super cheap so that could be a way you to stretch your fructose longer if desired. I don't include electrolytes, but if you want you can. The electrolyte recipe further down this post can definitely be added to this if you like it combined. I do not add any flavoring, but if you want you can add whatever you like.\n\nThe recipe:\n\nSingle Maurten 320\n\n* 48g Maltodextrin\n* 32g Fructose\n* 1.25g Pectin\n* 1g Sodium Alginate\n\nBelow is the recipe of Maurten 320 scaled up 10x. Feel free to adjust quantities to fit your needs. I like a 10x batch in a big zip lock to use as needed. If you want, you can even do 20x, etc.\n\n10x Maurten 320\n\n* 480g Maltodextrin\n* 320g Fructose\n* 12.5g Pectin\n* 10g Sodium Alginate\n\nWhen making a gel, take your total desired volume and use 60% carbs + 40% water. Add boiling water and it will dissolve fairly quickly. Maltodextrin takes the longest. The consistency is thick enough that it doesn't shoot out of your preferred pouch uncontrollably but also is easy enough to drink & swallow. For the 150ml pouches I do 120g carbs + 80g water in a bowl. Mix with a hand mixer and then dump into a pouch. Filled to the fill line results in about 105g of carbs per pouch, so two pouches could easily fuel an entire marathon. Typically, I use these [reusable children's food pouches](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp\\_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk\\_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl\\_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp\\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)) as they are environmentally friendly, fit my half tights easily, and are dishwasher safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Electrolytes**\n\nI straight up copied this from Toyman on TrainerRoad. It was easy and cheap enough and has worked well. I suffer from migraines, dehydration being a trigger. I do drink a lot of water every day and typically avoid high salt foods. I have absolutely noticed that this mixture has helped me stay hydrated better and has improved that aspect of my personal life, outside of running. I typically start my day with 16oz of water and 1-1.5g of this. Again, I don't add anything for flavor. You could add lemon juice, citric acid, or flavoring if you want. It's easy enough to drink that it does not bother me. Sodium citrate is much more palatable, so it's almost flavorless to me. There is some evidence regarding improvement in uptake of electrolytes in the presence of carbohydrates. I will often add 10-20 grams of table sugar if I am not consuming any other carbs when taking electrolytes. The below recipe is easily about 100 servings, so it stretches easily.\n\nThe recipe:\n\n* 25g MgS04 (magnesium sulfate/epsom salt)\n* 8g calcium carbonate\n* 80g Morton lite salt\n* 367g sodium citrate (hydrated)\n\nYou should achieve per 1/2 teaspoon (roughly 3g):\n\n* 1000mg sodium\n* 200mg potassium\n* 50 mg calcium\n* 50 mg magnesium\n\nNote: these ingredients mix well besides the Epsom salt. I put some on a Ziploc bag and used a hammer to smash it into a powder. That way it wouldn't fall to the bottom of the bag and blended better with the mixture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recovery (Post Run)**\n\nAfter looking into the recovery drinks, they are pretty simple. With the above recipes you pretty much already have what you need besides the protein. Tailwind Recovery is like $40 and that gets you 15 servings! Skratch isn't much different. Bulk Supplements has whey isolate and casein protein on amazon for pretty cheap. Whey isolate is fast absorbing, casein is slower. I don't know what is better, so I use both. Choose whatever you want here. The post run recovery drinks tend to do a 4:1 carb to protein mixture, which makes the price seem even more outrageous. There must be some science behind that ratio, so use it if you like. That is very little protein, which means your bulk protein powder will last even longer. I use a bit more. For the carbs you can use your carb mix. I prefer table sugar. My above carb mix is only for my gels. I am not as concerned with the post run carb source. Additionally, you could add in something like rice flour to this if you wanted a bit more of a \"whole food\" carb source. Also, feel free to adjust the desired carbs based on how hard your workout was. I am just simply looking for a quick drink to get some nutrition post run. After my shower, getting the kids up and ready, before I head off to work, I do eat a decent balanced breakfast. This just gives my body something to help with recovery. Again, not much for flavor here. I am not picky. Feel free to add what you want (chocolate sauce, vanilla extract, caramel sauce, orange juice, milk, etc.).\n\nI have been doing the following with fine success.\n\n* 1.5g Electrolytes\n* 20g - 40g table sugar (based on workout)\n* 10g Whey isolate\n* 10g Casein\n* A few dashes of cinnamon for flavor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future Bonus**\n\nI am currently working on a copycat Maurten 225 Solid bar recipe. Essentially, it's just Rice Krispy cereal, oatmeal, rice flour, and some simple syrup. I haven't nailed the ratios just yet, but when I do, I will update this post as well as probably create a new post. I find this is great to eat before a long run or with my post run breakfast for more carbs after a hard run.\n\nCredit: Jim Downing, Dr. Alex Harrison, Toyman, and I'm sure many others that I gleaned information from as I copied and modified some of these recipes from Reddit, YouTube, and TrainerRoad.\n\nCheers!",

I will be making these!\n\nI have been making my own electrolyte drinks myself for years, mainly just sodium/potassium in the summer when doing 100K+ a week daily running and sweating a lot. (I worked out I get everything else I need from diet)\n\n\n I have the philosophy which may be incorrect that energy drinks are overused during training (for a marathon or less) and are mainly for races for the following reasons:\n\n\n  In training you shouldn't get to the point of glycogen depletion. The runs aren't long enough and you don't go full speed.\n\n\n  On weekly long runs, it's actually good to get your body near to glycogen depletion to teach it to be more efficient with the glycogen. Similar to how threshold runs teach your body, and elite runners training at high altitude with less oxygen.\n\nExceptions:\nPracticing taking energy gels or drinks is critical, otherwise on race day you might find they make you sick. You need to figure out what works best for you.\n \n\n Not everyday is a threshold run, and not everyday should be a near glycogen depletion day. They help you recover quicker for the next training run.\n\n Anyway, that's all irrelevant to this post...\n\n\n  I prefer Maurten drinks, usually 360. They don't give you the sweet feeling in your tummy like gels.\nI couldn't figure out what the gel substance was, that's the sodium alginate right?  What's the pectin for?\n\nIt takes a long time to prep these mixes. I make them in bulk and separate into daily amounts. I then buy big clear plastic straws (smoothy style) and seal one end with a heated bag sealer, pour the ingredients into each one and seal the ends with the bag sealer.\n\nThen I just have to cut the tops and pour into my 500ml drink pouches and add water.\n\nI too found I needed to use hot water to speed up the mix, but it makes the process so much longer... I found a better way though, just prepare using cold water the night before when getting your running stuff ready for the 5am run, it will mix fine overnight with cold water.",

You need to concentrate on creating craveably comforting and flavorful things that your mom will WANT to eat and drink.

Store bought chicken and beef stock are barely flavored, salty water with no nutritional value. \n\nHomemade stock is loaded protein, collagen, vitamins, and minerals - and huge flavors. Adding a roux to a stock adds carbs and fat.  Homemade gumbo base literally has it all.  Season to taste and add a pinch of MSG to make it even more flavorful to help your mother eat more.  MSG gets a bad rap, but amps up the flavor if she’s not sensitive to it.  \n\nA spoonful or two of pickle juice helps break up the monotony of the gumbo richness if that’s all she can eat. Mix it up by making different chicken, shrimp, beef, and fish stocks, gumbos, and étouffées.  There are lots of varieties of red, white, blonde and dark “gravies” in creole cooking so it doesn’t get monotonous. \n\nAlways finish a meal with ice cream or pudding.

        "body": "Make a roux.  1 part flour to 1 part fat of choice (usually butter, but any oil will work).  Blonde roux has the most thickening power when added to stock.  So, I recommend cooking the roux to at least a peanut butter color.  The darker the roux, the more flavor but with less thickening power.  That means you can add more fat to your stock without getting it too thick.  This is the “secret” to any good gumbo recipe. \n\nI had the same issue with my mother, so here’s a few tips on making your stock: \n\n1. If your aren’t already using one, get a pressure cooker like an instapot.  Get the big one.\n2. Buy whole chickens and break them down yourself. Save all the skin, bones, offal, carcass, feet and all the bits that usually get thrown out.  Roast all the bits in the oven until a little browned.  There’s flavor in the brown. \n2a.  Use the chicken parts with the most cartilage and collagen - skin, wings, feet, breast bone are all the best for making a stock loaded with nutritional proteins. \n3. Save all your scrap herbs and vegetables. Thyme, oregano, rosemary, parsley, cilantro stems; carrot ends and peels, potato peels, onion ends; Anything you would add to a vegetable broth.  I add all this stuff to a container in the freezer when I’m cooking until I’m ready to make stock.\n4. Fill the instapot pressure cooker to the max fill line with roasted chicken bits and vegetable scraps.  Just cover with water. Sprinkle in a few whole peppercorns for flavor. The goal is to make a chicken stock super-loaded with colagens and nutrients. Half a lemon adds another level of brightness.  \n5. Set the pressure cooker to cook on high for 2 hours, then stay warm overnight. This will leech the max amount of nutrients into your stock.  With an instapot, this is set it and forget it.  There are other models that do the same.\n6. Strain the stock through a colander and fine mesh sieve.  Compost or throw out the solids.  Refrigerate the stock overnight until the fat congeals at the top.\n7. Scape the schmaltz (rendered chicken fat) off the top of the refrigerated stock. When done correctly, the stock (when cold) will have the consistency of Jello because of all of the collagens and natural gelatins.  Reserve the schmaltz for making even more flavorful roux. \n\nBy itself, this stock is super-nutritious, but contains little “fat”.  For my mother, I’d make a dark (gumbo) roux with the schmaltz and butter and add to the stock.  Bring to a boil and keep adding more roux until you get to the thickness consistency you are looking for.  Étouffée consistency was easier to swallow than gumbo consistency for my mother. Étouffée consistency also has more fat and calories.  \n\nAdding some salt and MSG makes it even more craveable to help get your mother to consume more calories. \n\nYou can make seafood stock the same way with fish bones, skins and shrimp shells. Beef bones and cartilage parts also are extremely good.  \n\nPork and venison bones do NOT make good stock.  Trust me on this. \n\nWishing you all the best with your mother.\n\nEdit: Oily fish like salmon, herring, and mackerel make the most calorie-rich seafood stock.  Ice cream is also a great way to get more calories into your mother.  No such thing as too much ice cream!\n\nEdit 2: Étouffée consistency refers to the richness and thickness of the base and depends on how much roux you add to the stock.  You don’t have to add the Trinity of vegetables (onions, celery, bell peppers) if your mother can’t eat solid food.  Sweat the vegetables in a sauté pan and add them to the pressure cooker to impart the same flavors to the stock and filter out the solids when the stock is done.  Old Creole and Cajun recipes are your friend here. They are all about adding fat and flavor.  Pay more attention to the preparation of the base than the “chunky stuff”. All the flavor is in the base anyway when you do it right.",

    "body": "Hi All,\n\nI wanted to share some information on running nutrition. I have spent way too many hours googling this stuff and I think it can help the community save some money, as it has for me. I haven't been seriously running for long. I am SO far from elite. I do have a bit of a background in the chemical and food industry, so a lot of this was easy to make sense of. I thought I would compile some of the information I have so there is a centralized place to find it. If anyone has better recipes, better ideas, or anything to add - please feel free to.\n\nThese recipes could/would replace products like Maurten 320, Gu, Tailwind, Skratch, electrolytes, and post run recovery drinks. The following are just guides and can be modified to your desired sources of carbs, electrolytes, activity, and uses.\n\nI source all the ingredients through amazon. I prefer the brands Pure & Bulk Supplements. Their prices seem to be good, and shipping is prompt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Carbs**\n\nThis carb recipe is what I use. It's pretty much an exact replica of Maurten 320. Someone smarter than me designed it so I feel fine with it. If you desire a hydrogel type drink, then just mix 80g of it with 500ml of water and you will have Maurten 320. The hydrogel is backed by science, Joshua Rowe prior to his employment at Maurten tested this idea in a study and did prove its effectiveness. Other companies have claims against this actually having any improvement in carb uptake. I figure it can't hurt, so I include the gelling components. Additionally, I use this same base as a gel. So one carb mix allows me to decide what I want to use depending on the application/workout. I use a maltodextrin and fructose blend, because the maltodextrin isn't very sweet. Its palatable without being overly sweet. If you want to be even more cost effective, use straight up table sugar. It's a 1:1 ratio, versus a 1:0.8, so it would perform almost identically. You can also go 2:1 if you want even less sweetness by having a reduced fructose amount. Maltodextrin is super cheap so that could be a way you to stretch your fructose longer if desired. I don't include electrolytes, but if you want you can. The electrolyte recipe further down this post can definitely be added to this if you like it combined. I do not add any flavoring, but if you want you can add whatever you like.\n\nThe recipe:\n\nSingle Maurten 320\n\n* 44g Maltodextrin \n* 36g Fructose \n* 1.25g Pectin \n* 1g Sodium Alginate  \n\nBelow is the recipe of Maurten 320 scaled up 10x. Feel free to adjust quantities to fit your needs. I like a 10x batch in a big zip lock to use as needed. If you want, you can even do 20x, etc. \n\n10x Maurten 320\n\n* 440g Maltodextrin \n* 360g Fructose \n* 12.5g Pectin \n* 10g Sodium Alginate  \n\nWhen making a gel, take your total desired volume and use 60% carbs + 40% water. Add boiling water and it will dissolve fairly quickly. Maltodextrin takes the longest. The consistency is thick enough that it doesn't shoot out of your preferred pouch uncontrollably but also is easy enough to drink & swallow.  For the 150ml pouches I do 120g carbs + 80g water in a bowl. Mix with a hand mixer and then dump into a pouch. Filled to the fill line results in about 105g of carbs per pouch, so two pouches could easily fuel an entire marathon. Typically, I use these [reusable children's food pouches](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp\\_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk\\_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl\\_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib\\_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp\\_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Modern-Reusable-Food-Pouches/dp/B08SRSWFY6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37J2J5RL9Y5RJ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.bTt4-fkUYWw7NM9Y8YVRco2EdvSKDBbGhQ1UkSwF8Bb9rnevEz02y6zY0RGA8au35PRJCLcSX6wUW9rrA-3qwHhbb5GPNLKe6LGParjW6p-KkaAp_vsmuF8PhDyEuEd3S8qWdTQaadhpigY721Pdyk_-SG2xtZLvAqFIl13xqGyCa7yyePtDqxJhQPRp8hakwZOEv5PQfWg53qaoIrapnna6PMWVK1J5XiJDxVDTexHr4ouALl_1htt4gwUOYWYIdili4KK0yCb7Oz7qCI36fPcyPYGSSoXHN2E9wSPaNAI.o2RowZ4o9FZBcSdUjh4VSw-ylCG9wd5N4j2Klc1Rld0&dib_tag=se&keywords=baby+food+pouches+refillable&qid=1708644403&sprefix=baby+food+poucn%2Caps%2C341&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)) as they are environmentally friendly, fit my half tights easily, and are dishwasher safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Electrolytes**\n\nI straight up copied this from Toyman on TrainerRoad. It was easy and cheap enough and has worked well. I suffer from migraines, dehydration being a trigger. I do drink a lot of water every day and typically avoid high salt foods. I have absolutely noticed that this mixture has helped me stay hydrated better and has improved that aspect of my personal life, outside of running. I typically start my day with 16oz of water and 1-1.5g of this. Again, I don't add anything for flavor. You could add lemon juice, citric acid, or flavoring if you want. It's easy enough to drink that it does not bother me. Sodium citrate is much more palatable, so it's almost flavorless to me. There is some evidence regarding improvement in uptake of electrolytes in the presence of carbohydrates. I will often add 10-20 grams of table sugar if I am not consuming any other carbs when taking electrolytes. The below recipe is easily about 100 servings, so it stretches easily. \n\nThe recipe:\n\n* 25g MgS04 (magnesium sulfate/epsom salt)\n* 8g calcium carbonate\n* 80g Morton lite salt\n* 367g sodium citrate (hydrated) \n\nYou should achieve per 4.8 grams:\n\n1000mg sodium  \n200mg potassium  \n50 mg calcium  \n50 mg magnesium\n\nNote: these ingredients mix well besides the Epsom salt. I put some on a Ziploc bag and used a hammer to smash it into a powder. That way it wouldn't fall to the bottom of the bag and blended better with the mixture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recovery (Post Run)**\n\nAfter looking into the recovery drinks, they are pretty simple. With the above recipes you pretty much already have what you need besides the protein. Tailwind Recovery is like $40 and that gets you 15 servings! Skratch isn't much different. Bulk Supplements has whey isolate and casein protein on amazon for pretty cheap. Whey isolate is fast absorbing, casein is slower. I don't know what is better, so I use both. Choose whatever you want here. The post run recovery drinks tend to do a 4:1 carb to protein mixture, which makes the price seem even more outrageous. There must be some science behind that ratio, so use it if you like. That is very little protein, which means your bulk protein powder will last even longer. I use a bit more. For the carbs you can use your carb mix. I prefer table sugar. My above carb mix is only for my gels. I am not as concerned with the post run carb source. Additionally, you could add in something like rice flour to this if you wanted a bit more of a \"whole food\" carb source. Also, feel free to adjust the desired carbs based on how hard your workout was. I am just simply looking for a quick drink to get some nutrition post run. After my shower, getting the kids up and ready, before I head off to work, I do eat a decent balanced breakfast. This just gives my body something to help with recovery. Again, not much for flavor here. I am not picky. Feel free to add what you want (chocolate sauce, vanilla extract, caramel sauce, orange juice, milk, etc.). \n\nI have been doing the following with fine success.\n\n* 1.5g Electrolytes\n* 20g - 40g table sugar (based on workout)\n* 10g Whey isolate\n* 10g Casein\n* A few dashes of cinnamon for flavor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future Bonus**\n\nI am currently working on a copycat Maurten 225 Solid bar recipe. Essentially, it's just Rice Krispy cereal, oatmeal, rice flour, and some simple syrup. I haven't nailed the ratios just yet, but when I do, I will update this post as well as probably create a new post. I find this is great to eat before a long run or with my post run breakfast for more carbs after a hard run. \n\nCredit: Jim Downing, Dr. Alex Harrison, Toyman, and I'm sure many others that I gleaned information from as I copied and modified some of these recipes from Reddit, YouTube, and TrainerRoad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers!",

I add sodium citrate to get some sodium, and also use it on the side for when it's summer and I just add carbs to hydration and also need some sodium for fluid loss.\n5.

In any case, it also works fine if you leave the sodium alginate out of the recipe. I still have to try Pectin as it should have similar thickening effects. As for dissolving the carbs: hot water may make it faster, but Maltodextrin doesn't dissolve in hot water so it's not necessary at all, just let it sit overnight, a french press is really helpful to prevent to the Malto from floating to the surface of the liquid (which creates chunks).",

In things like cheese, it will prevent against the \"entangling\" of proteins, which improves meltability and emulsification ability.

You can buffer that pH without adding too much sugar. \n\nIt's a wildly versatile ingredient that both affects taste perception as well as product performance.

        "body": "So I was looking into [Physiogel Calming Relief AI cream](https://incidecoder.com/products/physiogel-calming-relief-ai-cream) in more depth, and I'm so confused about the ingredient Palmitamide MEA aka PEA aka Palmitoylethanolamide. Because with a brief look earlier I saw the Palmitamide MEA in it and thought it's one of the ceramides (the names are so similar haha!). However, today I saw incidecoder mentioning it as just a viscosity controlling ingredient (and I usually find them quite accurate), but more things came up where I saw something from mdedge [here](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/74188_main.pdf) stating \"Palmitamide MEA (PEA) is an important component of MimyX nonsteroidal cream, Dr. Smith said. PEA is an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties\" but this doctor has a consulting agreement with Stiefel Labs, which manufactures Physiogel. Also came across this [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955631/) but it's testing a synthetic ceramide PC-104 in combination with other things like Palmitamide MEA, grapeseed extract etc. Plus, I remember reading an AMA from kindofstephen where he said \" I think most cosmetic companies would attribute patents as a marketing cost. Most novel patents I've seen in the cosmetic industry are to deal with delivery vehicles (like an airless soft container, etc)\". My takeaway is things can be patented even if they're not doing too much, because to consumers it seems like it's doing a lot? And now idk if this ingredient/Physiogel is any good as a ceramide cream or it's just a good plain heavy moisturiser.\n\nEdit: Realised this ingredient is present in Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume, along with SK-Influx, where it's described as \"Atoderm Intensive Baume quickly stops itching and reduces the urge to scratch thanks to its anti-itching dermatological active ingredient PEA\"\n\nMy understanding is Physiogel doesn't have any ceramides or cholesterol/phytosterols (looks like Zeroid uses phytosterols in place of cholesterol?), but has PEA as a fatty acid (skin similar ingredient), so it must be a good moisturiser but not an ideal-ratio ceramide moisturiser.",

Swirl it around until it's homogeneous. Adding suran wrap with holes helps really get them.\nFlies all day!\n\nAs for your pattern, the soap is what is called an amphipathic molecule. It had polar and nonpolar regions with this long chain molecule. These long molecules in the acidic vinigar solution will want to arrange themselves in the most stable fashion. This would be by having all the polar carboxylic acid and amine groups facing one another or sitting close to one another. The nonpolar alkyl chains will fold or protrude from these \"headgroups\" in such a way as to have the most surface area as possible arranged closely with one anothers nonpolar chains. This is the microscopic effects occurring at the boundary layer with the soap and acid solution. The macroscopic pattern that you see is an emergent effect from as the boundary layers although \"random\" develop stable and unstable regions. This is an effect described in chaos theory as someone had previously stated. It's a REALLY cool thing to check out.\n\nAs for what the right ratio of soap and water do, a SMALL amount of soup. Will break the tight arrangement of all the polar water molecules. This lowers the surface tension because the water molecules can't hang out next to one another. And especially at the surface, those nonpolar regions will display their alkyl chains, making it easier for materials to slip into the water and not be held up by the tight water arrangement. That's why the fruit flies slip into the water so easily.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¹. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.²\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¹ n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"² Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease³. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.⁴  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp⁵.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea⁶.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¹, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¹.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.⁷ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA’s approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¹¹ \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¹² It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¹³ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR⁸, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.⁹ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¹⁰ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

It didn't even have an official sign on it, just the name and price handwritten in sharpie, so it must be super new. \n\n[Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer with aloe and green tea extract](http://imgur.com/a/q6TViPm) 75ml - $8.99\n\nIt's definitely one of their more expensive cosmetics but based on the ingredients it looks pretty good for the price. Luckily TJs has a great return policy so if I don't like it I can get my money back.\n\n\nFull ingredients list:\n\nWater (aqua), glycerin, saccharide isomerate, propanediol, ammonium acryloxyldimethyltaurate/VP copolymer, phenoxyethanol, polyamide-5, dimethicone, hydroxyacetophenone, polysilicone-11, squalane, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, laureth-12, ceteryl olivate, glyceryl stearate, ethylhexylglycerin, sorbitan olivate, sunflower seed oil, cetearyl alcohol, lactobacillus ferment, tocopherol, sodium stearoyl lactylate, sodium hyaluronate, milk thistle extract, birch leaf extract, beta-sitosterol, panthenol, squalene, coconut fruit extract, citric acid, green tea leaf extract, sodium citrate.\n\n\nIt doesn't have a fancy smell, in fact it kind of smells like a medicinal cream like tret or hydrocortisone, but the smell dissipates on application. It's a very light gel cream and it sinks in fast. It comes in a frosted plastic jar.\n\nI am patch testing it tonight so I will update when I get to know it a little better. I'm not great at analyzing the more chemically-sounding ingredients, but I can tell that it does silicones and does not have alcohol denat, which is good for me. I was drawn to the buzzword ingredients like squalane, aloe, lactobacillus ferment, hyaluronic acid, green tea, and other extracts. If anyone has any more knowledgeable insight based on the ingredients, I would love to hear it. \n",

There were 2 full sets of tubes collected, one obtained via IV that was hemolyzed, and was that was obtained by a MLS that was not, that set is what is pictured. However the hemolyzed set red top tube showed the same situation as this red top.  The order of the draw by the MLS was Blood cultures > Sodium Citrate > Red Top (BD has silica in the tubes to aid coagulation) > Lith Hep > EDTA > Potas Oxalate.  The MLS obtained set was spun after about 15 minutes, the IV obtained Red top tube had sat for over 30 minutes. It's not a simple goober.  We weren't planning on running the sample so doesn't matter that we respun it, was just spinning it down to toss in the fridge.\nWe showed this to our manager who has 30+ years in the field, and said he's never seen anything like it, and my coworker and myself haven't seen anything like it either with 5 years each as well. \nTook it to the ER doc, explained the differences between the 2 tubes, and based off of that he ordered a ddimer, and that result was reported as >5000.

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F17**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae](https://preview.redd.it/04x8cx1jvsy81.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db29ff28ad9fbcd3ff56a158d60e872ed63cb538)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise!

I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\nand that's all from my side! I know its not much but then again kangaal haalaat mein kharidaari mushkil hai 💀. anyway, here's a list ss that I do want to try once this lot is finished:\n\n* sunscoop sunscreen serum (only if dermaco doesnt work lmao. really intrigued)\n* Face shop sunscreens (itne variants . ek try karne ka mann hai 😖)\n* beauty of joseon rice ss (stock mein aaja bhai 😫)\n* missha sun aqua gel and essence (bas aise hi lol)\n\nI've also tried the neutrogena ultra sheer, episoft , a few banana boat ones but way long ago so I don't clearly remember them to give the verdict on them. just if I haven't repurchased them, consider that they didn't work well for me.\n\nhope this was informational and you guys enjoyed! if you still have any other questions related to the product above, feel free to comment!",

    "body": "For a few months, I've been playing around with different ways of making cheese sauce for mac and cheese. Initially I was focused mainly on what blends of cheeses and seasonings work best (still haven't fully decided on that), but lately I've been more concerned with the consistency of the sauce, particularly when using milk as a base intsead of cream, since I don't usually keep cream in my house.\n\nGetting the cheese and milk to mix smoothly has of course been easier said than done. It's pretty much a problem of mixing oil and water, in disguise. I know american cheese melts very smoothly into milk because of all the emusifiers it contains, but I wanted to stick to less processed cheese. Thus I've been experimenting. \n\nRecently I saw Adam Ragusea's video on making mac and cheese with Sodium Citrate, and I wanted to try it out. The problem is that I of course don't have pure sodium citrate in my house, and I didn't want to buy some just for this one thing. I decided to turn to some simple chemistry for a workaround.\n\nSodium citrate is really just the sodium salt of citric acid. Baking soda neutralizes acid, creating a soluton of the coresponding sodium salt. Lemon juice has a lot of citric acid in it. So, if I carefully mix baking soda and lemon juice, the result is a crude sodium citrate solution.\n\nI added the soluton to some butter, aromatics, milk, and cheddar-mozzarella blend on heat, only about a shotglass about half full of the  solution for a serving of about a pint or so. The resulting sauce was incredibly smooth. It worked so much better than I thought it would. This stuff is a surprisingly potent emulsifier\n\nI'm sure other people have tried doing something like this before, but I haven't found much online about it, mainly because searching baking soda and lemon juice brings up a lot of results for alternative medicine. I found a blog post where someone did this to make nacho cheese, but that's it. I think this is a really useful technique though, so I'd like to share it.\n\nEDIT: A lot of you have brought up making a roux, and I absolutely agree that it is a viable method for making mac and cheese. I personally just find this method to be easier, but it's a matter of personal preference.\n\nSome other people have asked what a good ratio is between the lemon juice and baking soda. I don't really have an answer to that, since the lemon juice can have varying amounts of citric acid. I just slowly added the baking soda until a) it stopped vigorously fizzing and b) it tasted salty and not sour.",

I wait for it to just start to simmer before added more.\n*I then added shredded cheese in small handfulls, letting each addition melt before the next. I basically added until it tasted cheesy enough for me.\n\nOnce that was done, I mixed in about two cups of pasta and ate it like that.

So unless you precise in weighing and measuring, you don't know what you have nor could you make another. Just buy sodium citrate on line if you must. About 6 bucks usd. It's the very alkaline state, three sodiums, trisodium citrate. Very negatively charged state. When adsorbed to fatty micelles, it increase negative surface charge and thus repulsion and stabilization.\n\nYou real problem is you are not making a cheese sauce correctly. You need to make a starchy solution first before trying to melt cheese, especially hard cheese, into a watery medium. Many cooks use flour and butter to make a roux and then stir in milk. When thickened stir in grated cheese off heat. The long starch molecules envelop the fatty micelles protecting them from touching and coalescing, breaking the emulsion which is what cheese is technically.",

Pictured above.\n\n**Fragrance:**  ~~Yes. An extremely artificial flowery scent. Dissipates, but I find it slightly annoying while applying.~~. None. \n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:** Got this when my previous gel moisturiser got over. I had already used the other 3 and I started using this with fairly high expectations. And I was / am disappointed. **It's not bad. It moisturises**. But I was expecting a jelly like moisturiser that sinks in easily while still packing a moisture -filled punch. And this is not that. It takes way longer than I'd like to sink in.  I either have to compromise on the quantity I use and the moisturised feeling or go around feeling oiler than I would like. It's the kind of product that does everything to some level, but none of them spectacularly or to an above average level.\n\nAs far as healing for barrier damage is concerned, I get way faster results from the other three Bioderma moisturisers and I pretty much never touch this for that purpose after the initial trial period.\n\nThis does have a few de-pigmenting ingredients, but so far I've not been able to see anything results that I can directly attribute to this product.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**  Moisturised feeling. I've used this with actives that are known to cause dryness and faced no issues. It can handle drying actives. No glow noticed. No standout effects.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:**  Can't think of anything. If you start using this with low / zero expectations, you'll probably like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status:**  Jury's still out, haven't decided. But as of now it's a **Will Not Repurchase.**\n\n\n***Additional Notes on whether the product is fake****\n\n**Tl;dr: Old tube is genuine, NOT FAKE.  Confirmed by brand too. Review still stands**\n \n\nOn 24th October 2023\n\n1. Some people's experiences does not coincide with mine in important ways such as fragrance and I'm now wondering if mine was a fake, I contacted Bioderma but haven't received any info yet. But I'll update and or delete the review when I do get it. \n\n2 Of 5 people, 4 can't smell anything from their product and 1 can (but doesn't sound similar to my description. & Bioderma still hasn't replied :(\n\nOn 1st November 2023\n\n1. Bioderma replied on Instagram that my moisturiser is genuine, By the time they replied, I had already repurchased another tube from Tira, to check for myself. The new tube has already arrived and they are identical in all ways. Including from the same batch 😅. \n\n2. New tube arrived with bioderma samples, which jogged my memory. Old tube had also arrived with samples. Two of which I still have unopened. So chances of old tube being fake is 0.\n\n2. But the smell was still different. My old tube smells like a flower. My new one doesn't smell of anything, unless I put copious amounts on my arm and put my nose in it and even then it smells like a teeny bit chemically, Thats all. I can understand why most people say it smells like nothing, because that's what I would have said too, if I wasn't looking that closely. \n\n3. Anyway, I was breaking my head trying to figure out why my old tube is has that smell, And then it struck me. I had a perfume leak incident in my travel kit many months ago. Most of the stuff is replaced and I don't still have that perfume, so I'd kind of forgotten. The tube was new then and I didn't use it enough to note the frag or lack thereof. I think the gel or top of the packaging still smells of the perfume and that's why I was mistaken. \n\nSo that was much ado about nothing, apologies. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Atoderm Intensive baume\n\n**MRP:** 786 for 75 ml. Available in 45ml,  200 ml tube and  500 ml pump bottle.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.  Pictured above.

It doesn't smell exactly like grease but it reminds me of grease. It's a dusty, chemically smell that I associate with Bioderma moisturisers. Like if you've smelled any of the Bioderma moisturisers, all except the gel-creme have the same DNA, though they are not exactly the same. It's not repulsive, but it's there. Does dissipate after a minute or so.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  I bought this on a whim after a few friends raved about it. They were so so so right. This was the second bioderma cream moisturiser I used, so I knew it would help with barrier issues but it does so much more. When I first used this, I had oily to combination skin and I never ever used cream moisturisers by choice. I had a misconception that since I was an acne / clog prone, oily skinned person, that I need to stay as far away from cream moisturisers as possible. This is the moisturiser than changed my mind.\n\nIf I want a one and done PM product when I'm too tired or too lazy or too whatever, I reach for it.\n\nIf I want a one and done travel moisturiser, this is the only one I pack.\n\nSuper dry climate, this is it.\n\nAirplane dryness, this is it.\n\nSlight tingling, or signs of barrier damage incoming, this is it.\n\nBarrier damage, this is it.\n\nDerm procedures, this is it.\n\nBut in even other scenarios such as humid climate or AM routine, where this is NOT my ideal or go-to product, it still does a decent job. It holds its own. It can be greasy but hey it can be worked with. It does an amazing job moisturising without clogging pores for me.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:**\n\nMoisturised feeling.  Super soft skin. Heals Barrier overnight depending on damaged your skin is. It's my tried and tested barrier recovery product.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** Have repurchased 3 or 4 times. Will continue to repurchase till it's discontinued. Love it. **Holy Grail.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Bioderma Sensibio Forte Rapid soothing cream\n\nMRP: 1499 for 40 ml.\n\n**Texture:** White Cream.

A different version of that greasy smell.\n\n**Experience and thoughts in detail:**  This was first prescribed by my then dermatologist for application after a MNRF session. And since then till Atoderm intensive baume came into my life, this was a re-buy. **Slightest irritation, and I used to apply it**. I have urticaria, this helped with many of my allergic reaction episodes. **Skin will feel greasy, but it was soothing at the same time.** As soon as the greasiness disappeared, I used to reapply. **This was never a daily use moisturiser for me.** I kind of used it like medicine. As and when needed, at the quantity, I needed. However the soothing it provides does overlap with the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume and I've not repurchased this in more than a year. I simply use that, wherever I previously reached for this. I have a feeling this is a gold standard product for certain sub set of people who need a rich, soothing moisturiser, but for most of us, this can be a pass.\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Moisturised feeling. Very soothing on irritated skin.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The heaviness, I guess. Upto combination skin or barrier-damaged oily skin, it's fine. Very oily skinned people may want to avoid this for general use. And the price. Damn expensive for 40 ml.\n\n**Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase / Will Not Repurchase / Holy Fail Status:** As of now, I don't miss it in my routine, so **WNRP.** Considering the price and the benefit from the others, unless you have sensitive skin or are advised by your derm to try this out, I'd skip it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Cicabio Crème\n\n**MRP:** 1399 for 40 ml\n\n**Texture:** Green tinged Lotion.

I love it only slightly lesser than Atoderm Intensive Baume and mostly because it's comparatively way more expensive. 😅.  I wouldn't use this daily, there's no need, but definitely a barrier saviour product. I wake up with such soft glowy skin even when it's damaged, like the healthy part of my skin feel look glowy even if skin damage texture is still there to an extent.\n\n***Comparing with baume, since I use them both for similar reasons :*** I originally had the impression this was heavier than Atoderm Intensive Baume and that it forms a suffocating seal on the skin. This isn't true under normal circumstances. It does feel suffocating when barrier is SEVERELY damaged but not otherwise. I applied this on half and the baume of half my face to check if there's any major difference and no. **No functional difference noticed.**\n\n**Effect on skin/hair issues and result of using the product:** Soothing, Healing, Moisturising, it does it all.\n\n**Anything that you think others might find a con:** The price. And for a lotion consistency product it's quite heavy.\n\n**Repurchase Status**: When I started writing this review, this was going to be a WNRP, because between all of them, I'd only repurchase Atoderm Intensive Baume, but ngl, the more I thought about it, I find myself wavering. **This is a WRP.** I don't know when, but I'll probably come back to this at some point.\n\n# \n\n# Comparision\n\n***Ranking based on Use Case***\n\n||1st Choice|2nd Choice|3rd Choice|4th Choice|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|As an AM Moisturiser|None of them|Intensive Gel-creme|Intensive Baume|Sensibio Forte|\n|As an PM Moisturiser|Intensive Baume, Cicabio, Intensive Gel-creme, Sensibio Forte||||\n|Time taken for Healing|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte, Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme||\n|Versatility (Can work for any of the above use cases in a pinch)|Intensive Baume|Intensive Gel-creme|Cicabio|Sensibio Forte|\n\nI've ranked them after considering the following factors (these are the most important deciding factors for me personally).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As  AM Moisturiser:***\n\n**I would use absolutely none of them as an AM moisturiser.** That doesn't mean they can't be used as such. it's just that none of them absorb in minutes or 'set' when you use a normal amount or slather it on. They're all occlusive but not the matte kind. Intensive Gel-creme is the easiest one of them to use as an AM moisturiser.\n\nThis gif will show you how long it took for them to sink into my arm, which is way dryer than my skin. But caveat is that I don't always use a AM moisturizer (infact I very very rarely do), but i when I do, I slather it on like below. If you use a teeny teeny weeny bit, you might not face this issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/isq9941kddwb1.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***As PM Moisturiser:***\n\nI can't actually decide I love them all. Atleast I love Intensive Baume, Sensibio Forte and Cicabio, but there's nothing to complain about the gel creme either. ✨ **Skin just looks so nourished with all the Bioderma moisturisers.** ✨  If you use only a tiny amount, all of them will sink in by morning. I like to slather them all on. And how much is absorbed by morning completely depends on how damaged my skin is. If I catch signs of barrier damage early and use them, they'll sink in. If I've completely wrecked my skin, there will be residue when I wake up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***On healing***\n\nTime taken for healing: shortest to longest, ranked above. But honestly, most people don't need a moisturiser stronger than Intensive Baume even for barrier damage.\n\n**Note on the likeliness of clogging pores and causing acne: I've personally not had breakouts from any of them. None of them caused acne for me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n👉🏾 All 4 moisturisers are good.\n\n👉🏾 For most people Sensibio Forte & Cicabio is not necessary. Unless you have facial wounds, surgery on your face, intensive derm procedures, very bad rosacea and are prescribed or recommended these, I'd say skip them.  People with sensitive skin may like them though.\n\n👉🏾 If you have oily skin, you might like Bioderma Intensive gel creme.\n\n👉🏾 Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Baume has ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol. Ratio unknown, will link if I can find anything.\n\n👉🏾 I've seen a fair number of people mention that baume is heavy and breaks them out in this sub. Something to be aware of.\n\n👉🏾  If I had to suggest only one product, from the above, hands down it'll be Atoderm Intensive Baume and it's best cost - benefit wise too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Im going to buy the cica +arnica to try out next. The Atoderm Creme Ultra doesn't seem interesting enough to me to want to try. If I can get a mini or sample somewhere just to update this post, I'll do that.\n\nETA2: After writing so much I still like left somethings out , so I'm editing to add them. Apologies 🙏\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any other review, YMMV",

    "body": "So this is a long one, and maybe a little weird, but bear with me.\n\nBack in January I posted [this race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/10extap/louisiana_marathon_an_experiment_in_aggressive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) detailing my success with “aggressive” fueling during a marathon. It was such a game changer for me – I’m now convinced that outside of proper training, proper fueling might be the most important aspect of marathon success.\n\nSince this race, I’ve been exploring the online discussion surrounding high carb fueling in endurance sport, and one space that I’ve seen put way more emphasis on fuel is the cycling/triathlon space. Most of the recommendations for intra-race carb intake that I’ve seen for cyclists/triathletes will place the ***low end*** of carb intake at rates that are higher than anything I ever see recommended to runners. For instance, a conservative fueling strategy for a long ride might be 80g - 90g carbs/hour, and this is almost double the normal fueling strategy recommended to marathon runners. If one sticks to the often recommended 1 gel every 30 minutes of a marathon, that's only about 40g carb/hour. One thing I’m curious to see is if the mechanics of running limit our ability to take in carbs like cyclists do, or if we should be trying to get in closer to 100g of carbs/hour or more.\n\nSince I had success in my last race with about 75g carb/hour (a maurten gel every 20 minutes), I wanted to see if I could push this up a little bit and practice this fueling strategy as I train for Boston next month. In my long runs for this training block, I’m trying to take in about 80g carbs/hour.\n\nNow – if I decided to take in this much fuel in all my long runs, it gets expensive very quickly. At almost $4 (USD) a piece, to get in 80 grams of carbs/hour of maurten for a 2 hour run, that'd be like $24. So for a cheaper option I started looking into making my own sports drink. I was originally looking into recipes for combining maltodextrin and fructose (the contents of maurten). While I found maltodextrin to be pretty inexpensive, powdered fructose was turning out to be a little pricey. At one point I had added the three ingredients I needed to make sports drink – malto, fructose, and sodium citrate (more on this in a bit) - into my Amazon cart and the total was over $50 – more than I wanted to spend.\n\nSo after more snooping around on the internet, I found a sport drink recipe that alluded to some scientists claiming that a 1:1 ratio of glucose to fructose in sports nutrition is optimal (your gut can absorb many more grams of these two types of sugars together than they can just one alone), which led me [to this video](https://youtu.be/jU5tl7xFgp8). In the video, Alex Harrison argues that sucrose (table sugar) has an optimal ratio of 1:1 glucose to fructose. Therefore, sucrose should work just fine as a source of intra-workout fuel. It's also dirt cheap and readily available.\n\nSo, just drink sugar water? Well, you’ve got to add sodium, [and in another video](https://youtu.be/1gV5ImU8nYE) Alex says table salt should be fine, or sodium citrate can be used to increase osmolarity (I don’t really know what that means, it could mean very little. I find the sodium citrate tastes less salty and it is pretty cheap).\n\nWhat about flavor? I’ve seen Alex in some YouTube comments on his videos and on a forum recommend adding a little Gatorade powder to taste. For myself, I decided to use Kool-Aid packets. It’s cheap, it adds flavor without adding sugar, and no artificial sweeteners.\n\nSo here’s the recipe I’ve come up with. I’ve used this in two long runs so far with great success. No stomach issues, and I thought the drink tasted fine. I decided in our current weather I can take in about 500ml of water an hour (I’ll probably double that when it gets hot). My Nathan handheld water bottle holds a little more than this, so it also happens to be a convenient amount to carry. This provides 80g of carbs and \\~1000mg of sodium per bottle. I’ve been doing 1 bottle per hour during my long runs.\n\n**Recipe:**\n\n1. 500 ml of water\n2. 80g of table sugar\n3. A little less than a tsp (about 4g) of sodium citrate or table salt (\\~1000mg of sodium)\n4. Half a Kool-aid flavor packet\n\nI basically just took a swig of this every five minutes or so and finished the bottles at about the hour mark. Refilled and was good to go for the next hour. In both long runs (20 miles and 17 miles) I felt strong and didn’t have any low points. The sugar didn’t bother my stomach at all (yet in the past the only gels that didn't make me nauseous are maurten).\n\nDoes it taste amazing? *No.* I wouldn’t just drink this. But was it gross? Also no. I never struggled to get it down.\n\nFuture goals of this experiment: more carbs/hour. More water and sodium when it gets super hot in Louisiana.\n\nThought I’d share in case anyone else is interested in homemade nutrition and saving some money on overpriced gels.",

You may want to experiment with that.\n\nSomething else that might be interesting is that Maurten gels have their 'super special delivery system' but if look in the ingredients they just add alginate. That's a common ingredient in molecular cooking which can be bought in bulk in kitchen supply stores.

Forgive us for our very bootstrapped-feel website.  We made it ourselves. ;)\n\n>I’m curious to see is if the mechanics of running limit our ability to take in carbs like cyclists do, or if we should be trying to get in closer to 100g of carbs/hour or more.\n\nDr. Tim Podlogar and I go into this a bit at about 1 hour and 10 minutes into our 90-minute super-nerdy discussion about all things fueling science, posted last week on Michelle and my youtube channel.  It's mostly just us two sport scientists nerding out about topics we find interesting, but he shared some really interesting stuff about why runners might be under-fueling.  Super sharp guy.  \n\nTLDR: \n\n1. Guts are simply more sensitive during running.\n2. Running fuel products often have things in them that they shouldn't.\n3. Too much fiber in the diet is problematic closely timed around long efforts, and runners eat healthy! Ironic.\n4. Psychological stress around fueling furthers gut issues.  Positive feedback loop... ie. vicious cycle. \n\nHappy to answer questions here, on youtube, or of course on forums I frequent (trainerroad or slowtwitch, mostly.)

        "body": "We train with the same nutrition we plan to race with, correct? How would you use this Kool-Aid flavored mix during a race? Unless you're elite with your own water bottles at aid stations or you have a support crew, using a powder requires either mixing it during a race or carrying that extra water weight on you. That works for training long runs. But it's impractical for a marathon. It's why gels are so popular. Especially the newer isotonic gels like Maurten.\n\nI agree with you that most runners underfuel. I take in 80g carbs/hour with no digestive issues. As you mention, Maurten gels are expensive coming in at around $11-$12 for 75g. There's an alternative to Maurten in gel form that is much more afforable.\n\nEach serving of SiS Beta Fuel Gel delivers 40g of carbs in a 1:0.8 ratio. They cost $2.50/serving. That's $5 for 80g. It's less than half the price of Maurten. Like Maurten, they are also isotonic. They are better tasting than Maurten and with a slightly thinner consistency that's easier to consume during a run. SiS sells directly from their website in the EU and UK. In North America, it can be found on [The Feed](https://thefeed.com/products/sis-beta-fuel-gel-1?variant=39394948710463).",

I’m going to have to try this myself and am curious to see how far you can push it. My biggest concern is with osmolarity which impacts how fluids drain from the stomach to the large intestine where they are absorbed.  My understanding is that essentially the fluid in your stomach has to be at the right osmolarity  before it can be passed along to the intestines. If it’s too high then the body will pull additional fluid from elsewhere to dilute it so it can be passed along and absorbed. My understanding was that simple sugar drinks needed to be fairly dilute, like around 8%, for optimal absorption (whereas maltodextrin as a larger molecule can be absorbed at a much higher concentration). The mix you are using seems to be much more concentrated than that so maybe there’s more going on than I’m aware of - I need to check out the linked videos and websites since this is super interesting.

And comparatively how easy it is to carry nutrition on the bike. \n\nFor me, even if i wanted to keep the intake of proper hydration and nutrition on a run the weight of that amount of water would limit me so much. \nIn triathlon and cycling- the weight on the bike and in your pockets is not inhibiting you in any way. Whereas any food on a run is problematic and uncomfortable. \n\nOverall i think your solution is very nice and enjoyed reading the experiment, my input was more on the why runners dont fuel as much.",

I realized I never reviewed the sunscreens I've used so far lmao and I've tried plenty . so here's a review on all of them!. edit : this post was found in my draft, eating dust , so I decided to finish and publish it! lmao what a great way to ignore ki boards chal rahe hai 🤡\n\nBut first , a little guide on what filters are used in sunscreens!\n\n**what is a filter ?**\n\n* *Specific chemicals, known as ultraviolet (UV) filters, are added to sunscreens to absorb or block UV radiation from the sun. UV filters can offer protection against both UVA and UVB rays.*\n\n**what are UVA and UVB rays?**\n\n* *UVA rays* :  Long-wavelength. Can damage our skin’s DNA, which leads to signs of aging such as wrinkles. UVA is also responsible for hyperpigmentation. Can penetrate to and affect the deeper layers of the skin. May also promote the development of skin cancers.\n* *UVB rays* : Short-wavelength. Responsible for sunburn, skin aging and can promote the development of skin cancer. Doesn’t penetrate beyond the skin’s superficial layers.\n\n**types of filters** :\n\n* *UVA* : fights UVA rays\n* *UVB* : fights UVB rays\n* *Broad spectrum* : Fights both UVA and UVB\n\nI've mentioned all the filters and their types under the sub-heading of each sunscreen. their IUPAC names or chemical names are written in the ingredients list so on that basis, you should be able to choose which sunscreen to buy by looking at the chemical names of the filters! they're all mention in order and a simple run on incidecoder can tell you all! I didn't know about filters in the beginning or while buying sunscreens, so it was fun learning experience making this post !\n\n**how to differentiate between a mineral and chemical sunscreen?**\n\n* simple! if a sunscreen uses minerals in their ingredients then its a mineral/physical sunscreen. minerals to look out for : zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. if a sunscreen uses stuff besides these too, their chemical sunscreens! lol this is the simplest way I can explain these two.\n* most sunscreens on this list and in general, use a mixture of both minerals and chemicals . so mineral + chemical = hybrid sunscreens!\n\nOur country lies near the equator, so the UV index here is quite high at all times . so applying sunscreen is a must. *#dhoopsebacherahosunscreenlagateraho\\~*\n\n**F18 (umar badh gayi but dimaag nahi 💀)**\n\n**skin type** : dry , dehydrated and acne-prone. earlier : oily/combo acne prone so this has a mix of both ss for dry and oily skin.\n\n**concerns** : PIH , acne (pustules, fungal and cystic) pit scars, pores, blackheads and sebaceous filaments .\n\n**weather** : tapti garmi + humidity . dry winters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[dhoop se bachne ki vastuae ](https://preview.redd.it/fnjipguox9ma1.png?width=4000&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d880ff6b482ade3f03237375ef02cdd64fb4e3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Dermaco. 1% Hyaluronic Sunscreen Aqua Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 50ml from their website\n\n**for skin types** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance :** thin pale yellow gel-liquid. same texture as aloe vera gel but a little runny. fragrance free. absorbs completely . *hybrid sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list**: Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Titanium oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (broad spectrum filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n\nlove, love, love it!! one of the best budget sunscreens out there! wish they had a bigger size tho :( . super hydrating and absorbs really fast! 1% HA keeps the skin hydrated and it does pill at all regardless of how congested your routine ( for people like me, who stuff their morning and evening routines with +5 products lmao #thooso thooso aur thooso). the pump makes it seem like you run out of it pretty quick but cut the bottle in half and it will last another 3 days! no whitecast either due to the gel consistency . can be used by all skin types since the new formulation doesn't have fragrance (the old one did). pretty hard to get sine its oos on all platforms sometimes :( . best thing is that , it doesn't give that greasy feeling when you touch your skin. however , it does have oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can irritate your skin so be careful! do give it a try tho!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Re'equil oxybenzone free sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\] (not in the pic since I finished it!)**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 460 for 50ml . bought from nykka.\n\n**for skin types** : oily and acne prone. maybe even combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. has fragrance. gives a shiny finish. *chemical sunscreen*.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua,Titanium Dioxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Sodium Polyacrylate, Zinc Oxide,Glycerin, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Xylitol, Phospholipids, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Hyaluronic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, 1,3-Butylene Glycol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, C12-C15 Alkyl Benzoate, Benzophenone-3, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Sodium Benzoate, E-Ascorbic acid, Sodium Levullinate, Phenoxyehtanol, Allantoin, Melanin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* Tris-biphenyl triazine (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nok this was a huge let down. bought it since it was specifically marketed for oily skin. so much pilling and burning the area round my eyes :( . I got the airless pump packaging instead of the tube in some sort if limited edition packaging. whitecast is not an issue tho so that's nice. overall, didn't really find anything that good about it. didn't aggravate my acne so that's good. isn't water or sweat proof and will pill horrendously under a face mask 😖. if you have oily skin, you can give it a go although i would hardly suggest it to anyone tbh\n\n**rating** : 1/5 and WNRP\n\n* **L'Oreal Paris Uv Defender Serum Protector Sunscreen, Moist & Fresh \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought for Rs.550 from nykka)\n\n**for skin types** : only dry and combo skin types\n\n**texture and appearance** : white runny lotion. takes some time to absorb and rub in to eliminate whitecast. has a strong fragrance. the bottle design could be a pain when we're reaching the end of the product. hybrid sunscreen, has both physical and chemical filters!\n\n**ingredients list :** Aqua, Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Squalane, Glycerin, Drometrizole trisiloxane , Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol Denat., Triethanolamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Mica, Stearic Acid, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Tocopherol, Nylon-12, Ci 77891, Titanium Dioxide, Niacinamide, Sodium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Thermus Thermophillus Ferment, Peg-100 Stearate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Palmitic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Linalool, Tromethamine, Isohexadecane, Caprylyl Glycol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Barium Sulfate, Carbomer, Acrylamide/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer, Myristic Acid, Sorbitan Oleate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Bht, Butyrospermum Parkii Seed Cake Extract, Shea Seedcake Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, Glyceryl Stearate, Parfum, Fragrance\n\n**filters :**\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (UVA and UVB filter, marketed by loreal as meroxyl XL but is called Drometrizole trisiloxane everywhere else)\n* Mexoryl XS (UVA filter , again marketed exclusively by loreal but known as Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid everywhere else)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n\nomg this was so hyped when it first came out lol. I'd never tried loreal's previous ss so I had no previous expectations from it. first of all, its nice that they have different variants. I ultimately went with moist and fresh since it was marketed for dry skin types. the result was....underwhelming to say the least. its really greasy and sit on my face for a good 30 mins before the greasiness goes away. no pilling so that's nice. it does require some more rubbing for the whitecast to go away. leaves a shiny dewy look which I'm not very fond of but if you're into it, then go ahead. really strong fragrance tho so it could irritate sensitive skin types. for the hydrating factor, I'm not sure if it did anything since my AM routine already has quite a bit of hydration layering going around. overall, its a little heavy for humid climate where i live. drier ones might benefit from it. sun protection is okayish . also have to comment on the good range of filters it has so more frequent use will prevent tanning for sure!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and MRP maybe in another variant.\n\n* **A'PIEU Sun Block Cream \\[SPF 45\\]**\n\n**Mrp:** Rs. 700 for 50ml (bought it from amazon at dhamaka sale. had 60% so it was very cheap but due to customs and all it retails for around 2000 now. there are some sites like maccaron which sell it at 700 tho)\n\n**for skin types** : all except for sensitive type due to fragrance! packaging says dry skin types but could work for all imo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white cream. kind of thick but blendable. takes a while to absorb but once it does, it leaves a refreshing finish. has fragrance. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list**: Water, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Sorbitan Olivate, Citrus Aurantifolia (Lime) Flower Extract, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Nylon-12, Panthenol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Polyisobutene, Caprylyl Glycol, BHT, Sea Water, Polyacrylate-13, Polysorbate 20, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenylbenzimidazole Sulfonic Acid, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Prunus Persica (Peach) Flower Extract, Punica Granatum Flower Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Flower Extract, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus (Tasmanian Blue Gum) Leaf Extract, Sorbitan Stearate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, PEG-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Prunus Avium (Sweet Cherry) Flower Extract, Disodium EDTA, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl  Alcohol, Sodium Hydroxide, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Flower Water\n\n**filters**:\n\n* Avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* octyle salicylate (UVB filter)\n* ensulizole (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n\nBought this at first glance since it looked so cheap on amazon lmao. probably the cheapest Korean sunscreen I've found. and it works so good! really creamy and gel like. absorbs within minutes and no whitecast whatsoever. fragrance is there but it smells like any other sunscreen. there is a 100ml variant as well for 1050 I think but I haven't been able to find that. but either way, super effective in preventing tanning and doesn't irritate my acne at all!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **Conscious Chemist sun drink Hybrid Lightweight Gel Sunscreen \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: Rs. 600 for 50ml (bought for 450 from foxy)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one!\n\n**texture and appearance** : off white light gel. pump packaging so ease in takin the product out. fragrance free. absorbs withing seconds no joke. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Aqua, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Lecithin, Ceramide NP, Phospholipids, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alpha lipoic acid, Sodium Polyacrylate, Xylitol, Ceramide AP, Ceramide EOP, Cholesterol, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Caprylic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phytosphingosine, Milk Thistle Extract, D-alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Olive squalane, Sorbitol, Resveratrol, Sodium Levulinate and Potassium Sorbate\n\n**filters**:\n\n* titanium dioxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* zinc oxide (UVB mineral filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n\nthis was a major surprise! I know conscious chemist has a shitty rep here, which is completely understandable. I too have had ugly experiences with their new pigmentation serum (which I ultimately returned) but I ordered this along with it. and this is by far the best indian ss I've came across! even I cant believe this jewel came from a shitty company like cc but damn 🔥🔥. comparison wise, quite similar to dermaco HA (bonus!) but way thinner and kind of watery. super refreshing to apply. no greasy feeling or pilling. no whitecast. wished it had more UVA filters tho since they cause more skin diseases. but since it has a lot of UVB filters, it does prevent tanning pretty well! budget wise , its at 25% off at foxy most of the times, not so much on nykka. really enjoy this one!\n\n**rating** : 5/5 and WRP\n\n* **La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMune 400 Invisible Fluid Fragrance-Free \\[SPF 50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp**: CHF 31.95 for 50ml ( dad bought it from Switzerland but around Rs. 2450 🥵)\n\n**for skin types** : all! no exceptions for this one either!\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow fluid. really really watery , almost like a serum. lightweight and absorbs in a few minutes. fragrance free. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : AQUA / WATER ● ALCOHOL DENAT. ● TRIETHYL CITRATE ● DIISOPROPYL SEBACATE ● SILICA ● ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE ● BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE ● ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE ● BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE ● GLYCERIN ● PROPANEDIOL ● C12-22 ALKYL ACRYLATE/HYDROXYETHYLACRYLATE COPOLYMER ● SODIUM CITRATE ● METHOXYPROPYLAMINO CYCLOHEXENYLIDENE ETHOXYETHYLCYANOACETATE ● PERLITE ● TOCOPHEROL ● CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE ● ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER ● CAPRYLYL GLYCOL ● CITRIC ACID ● DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE ● DROMETRIZOLE TRISILOXANE ● HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE ● TEREPHTHALYLIDENE DICAMPHOR SULFONIC ACID ● TRIETHANOLAMINE ● TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE\n\nsorry in all caps lol. its the only way I found it and I ain't changing it cuz I'm ✨lazy✨\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Mexoryl XL (broad spectrum)\n* mexoryL SX (UVA filter)\n\nis it a surprise that foreign sunscreens have more filters than indian ones?🥲 hehe, we'll get there someday! anyway I had no idea about how LRP products worked on indian skin. but my dad bought a bunch of them (cicaplast baume, vit-c and hyalu 5 serums) from his trip so here we are! so due to my not-so-aware-about-this-brand thingy, I didn't expect this to be this watery damn. even the ones on insta were cream like but no this was the fluid. I absolutely love how this just absorbs and moisturizes my skin instantly. no whitecast or greasy feeling at all! I feel like this would work wonders for the most oiliest of skin types especially, since it hydrates but absorbs oil at the same time! because its so fluid, didnt pill my routine at all. does it prevent tanning tho? haven't clearly tested it out yet. I'm trying to stretch this as much as i can, knowing well enough id never buy it in INR again unless my dad goes again lmao. i will update this portion once i feel like its showing its effects for tanning! till then , this is amazeballs!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and sabko pata hai 🥲\n\n* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1850 for 22 gm (bought from beauty barn. sale lage toh cheen lena lol although youll get it much cheaper from an insta seller at around 1550)\n\n**for skin types** : dry and sensitive. could be icky for oilier types. okayish for combo. read the review for further explanation.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pura roll out karne ke baad, it looks like a candle lol. waxy and soft when you glide and ahaaa\\~ ekdum hawa ki tarah lagta hai hehe. have to rub and spread it out evenly after running the stick over. fragrance free. kind of sits on the face for a while but then vanishes into skin like magic! chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**filters**:\n\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nwhat a challenge it was to convince my dad to let me buy this 😖 somewhere even I wondered whether I should go with their watery sun gel instead of this. but then I was , aalas toh hoga hi, try karlete hai . le liya, daant bhi khai, bhashand bhi suna. but got it finally! I treat it very careful since this is probably the most expensive thing I've got with my own money lmao 🤡 maheeno ki pocket money ki bachai ke baad liya gaya hai, had a lot of expectations. and they did meet! really smoothe and soft when applied on the skin. have to rub in a little so it spreads out evenly. the texture after application is kind of like how a silicon ss would feel like but way less intense. even if it has a  fuckton of variants of HA , it isn't as hydrating , which was expected since its in a hard form lol. no whitecast obviously. thankfully no pilling since I was expecting stuff to pill when I drag it over. but it didn't happen! now for skin types, it can definitely work for dry and sensitive skins. oily skin types can find it a bit chip-chip due to humidity and high temperatures. could work substantially for combo skins as well, just take care of the t-zone tho. that being said, this is more suitable to work on all skin types during cooler temperatures in winter. also don't know whether it will let makeup stay on after application since I dont use makeup . but I can try since I do have foundation and shit. lemme know! sunburn and tanning is still under observation. will update this portion in the coming weeks!\n\n**rating** : 4/5 and lets see 👀 / id highly recommend this to buy only if your wallet allows you to! I did find it a bit mediocre and kind of not worth the price (should be retailed around 1100 smth) and you're better off buying a better fluid/cream ss in that much money.\n\n* **The Derma Co.** **1% Hyaluronic Acid Sunscreen Serum** \\[SPF 50 PA+++\\]\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 500 for 30 ml (bought from amazon)\n\n**For skin type** : all!\n\n**texture and appearance** : white thin liquid. fragrance free. really watery and leaves a dewy-shiny finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredient list** : Purified Water, Glycerin, Avena Strigosa Seed Extract, Lecithin, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Silica, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Decyl Glucoside, Propylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyacrylamide, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7 & Disodium EDTA.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* avobenzone (UVA filter)\n* oxybenzone (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was....okay-ish? idk but I was really excited for this since their HA sun gel is one of my HGs. This is kind of enjoyable, I really liked the watery texture and it didn't pill my routine at all , even during re-application. the dropper wasn't that much of a hassle to handle and worked great. the finish is something I'm not a fan of . the dewy-ness makes me look oily and sweaty and I have a tendency to touch my face a lot (really bad ik) but it feels greasy when I do that. its not sweatproof but the good thing is that when you do sweat, it doesn't bead off as white, meaning it wouldn't look like you got milk thrown at your face lmao. it does a good job in preventing tan but again with frequent application . I feel like it made me sweat a little faster but that could just be me. also the quantity you get is really less 😖 if I was to apply this everyday with 4 re-applications , this would  get over within 2 weeks. I used one whole dropper full on my face and neck btw. but being a liquid, I feel it spreads much better than a cream.\n\nrating : 3/5 and WNRP . you're better off with the gel formulation. I found this really mediocre.\n\n* **Axis-Y Complete No-Stress Physical Sunscreen \\[SPF 50+ PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1450 for 50ml (bought for Rs.999 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily combo skin types. those with dry skin like mine, might find it a bit more drying. good one for sensitive skins since it has a lot of calming ingredients as well!\n\n**texture and appearance** : thick white cream. fragrance free but has very strong ayurvedic smell. matte finish. physical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Zinc Oxide, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Propanediol, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Dicaprylyl Ether, Caprylyl Methicone, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Disiloxane, Niacinamide, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Artemisia Capillaris Flower Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Juniperus Virginiana Oil, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Water, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Magnesium Sulfate, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-3 Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Glyceryl Caprylate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Copaifera Officinalis (Balsam Copaiba) Resin, Tocopherol, Squalane, Allantoin, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5\n\n**filters** :\n\n* zinc oxide (mineral filter)\n* titanium dioxide (mineral filter)\n\nthis had been on my 'to buy' list for such a long time! and I finally got it during a march beauty barn sale! when I first tried it, I was really skeptical since it gave me a pretty bad whitecast and smelt so weird. I'm still not fond of the smell as it smells like the corner of an ayurvedic shop 😭. but afterwards I let it set on my face a little longer, and the whitecast goes away! it takes a good 5-7 min for it go away and I still got whitecast around my mouth. looked like doodh ki moochi lol (also have pigmentation and have to colour correct with orange) . so a little bummed about that :(  but then with mineral sunscreens, you're more prone to get a whitecast than a chemical one. it settles to a matte finish which I really liked! surprisingly I didn't really sweat with this on, maybe because I wore this inside my house more than outside so I'm not sure whether it will sweat off white or not. tanning and sun protection wise, cant say much (previous sentence). this was a bit drying for me and I had to apply 3 fingers worth to get some moisturization. I feel like I have to use this for a little longer to give a better review but for now I hope this helps.\n\nupdate : this ones a hard no for me. is it calming? yes. but the whitecast is too much. and when i sweat it literally looks like I'm secreting milk from my skin  (~~nipple)😭😭~~\n\n**rating** : 3.5/5 and MRP . on the edge of recommending this to people having medium-dark skin types (like mine) due to white cast.\n\n* **ISNTREE Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel \\[SPF 50 PA++++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1650 for 50ml (bought for Rs.1400 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : all! although most people say its for oily-combo, I found this to work equally well for dry skin types as well.\n\n**texture and appearance** : white watery gel as the name suggests lol. fragrance free. dewy-matte finish. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Water, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Homosalate, Dibutyl Adipate, Niacinamide, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cyclopentasiloxane, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Polysilicone-15, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Ceramide NP, Centella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceteth-10, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Decyl Glucoside, Propanediol, Tocopherol, Astaxanthin, Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Acrylates/​C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Xanthan Gum, Cetyl PEG/​PPG-10/​1 Dimethicone, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\n**filters** :\n\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n* Parsol SX (inorganic UV filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* homosalate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n\nman people don't lie when they say its there HG cuz damn this one is 🔥🔥🔥. so worth the hype! lightweight, watery and absorbs really well! when I touch my face, it doesn't feel greasy and really hydrating as well. and those filters already make me drool 🤤 only one drawback is the dewy finish , which I'm not fond of. no whitecast and no sweating milk drops for sure! in terms of sun burn and tanning prevention, this is gold! ughhhh it would be my HG if the price tag wasn't so hefty 😖 I use this only when I'm out for important outings aka bahar junk food khane jana lmao 😌 so you can guess I go out a lot heheh.

I'm not particularly sure about protection against sun on this one but oh well. also piddu si stick hai so kind of cute but lootne wala hai lmao\n\n**rating** : 2/5 and WNRP\n\n* **Tocobo** **Cotton Soft Airy Sun Stick SPF50 Pa++++**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 1550 for 20g (bought at 1100 from beauty barn)\n\n**For skin types** : oily, combination, acne prone skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale blue long cylinderical like stick. has a really pleasant and soft floral fragrance . leaves a matte fininsh and doesnt feel greasy on apllication. hybrid sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list :**  Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**filters** :\n\n* octocrylene (UVB filter)\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* octisalate (UVB filter)\n* Uvinul A Plus (UVA filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* titanium dioxide (physical filter)\n\nprobably the only sun stick that comes even close to the isntree sun stick. this gives such a good matte finish without any greasy feel . plus has cute floral smell to it that doesn't transfer to your skin or anything. and damn what a bang for a buck. probably the closest dupe for the isntree one. the only con is that it kind of pills after the 3rd application and rubs of oily after a while. if you are a person who touches their face every once in a while (like my dumbass), you might find it a bit uncomfortable. that being said, most of the times I just blot the grease away after 3-4hrs of application and apply another layer afterwards. sun protection wise, it does a good job! my forehead is the area that is the most prone to getting tan and it looked quite even toned after 3 weeks of consecutive use. one of my most favorite sticks (😏)\n\n**rating** : 4.5/5 and lets seeee\n\n* **Neutrogena beach defense sun stick water + sun protection SPF 50+**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs 1260 for 42 g (got it at Rs. 900 from amazon)\n\n**for skin types** : honestly, none lmao.

        "body": "also my post exceeded the word limit so here's some more lmao :\n\n   \n\n* **Cetaphil Sun light gel \\[SPF      50+\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 950 for 50 ml on amazon (bought from local pharma at a very low price . I don't remember how much but it was around 300 and way less than you find it online)\n\n**for skin types** : I don't even know. its that disappointing . but maybe for oily and combo skins. too drying for dry and heck no for sensitive skin.\n\n**texture and appearance** : off-white lotion-gel like consistency. white cast is so major you cant rub it away. fragrance free but I feel like it can irritate some skin types. chemical sunscreen.\n\n**ingredients list** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Methylene-Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol. (couldn't find the whole ingredients list. these are the IUPAC names of the filters mentioned below in order)\n\n**filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* octinoxate (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A plus (UVA filter)\n* Uvinul T 150 (UVB filter)\n* Tinosorb M (broad spectrum)\n\nthis was so bad I stopped using after 5 tries 😖 such noticeable white cast! plus burning on top of that. the amount of filters it has is amazing but such disappointing performance ughh. I enjoy majority of the cetaphil products but this was just not it. maybe those with lighter skin types would like it but the whitecast is way too much for me. plus the grease and pilling could probably compare to re'equil orange tube. currently using it on my body. the good thing is that, it does prevent sun tanning but is gonna be over soon since its a 50ml tube. if you don't mind whitecast on your body, then this could be a good body ss. but for the face, its a hard no from my side.\n\n**rating**: 2/5 and WNRP\n\n   \n\n* **Dermaco. Ultra Matte      Sunscreen Gel \\[SPF 60 PA +++\\]**\n\n**Mrp** : Rs. 700 for 50ml (got it free with my first purchase with Dermaco.) from their website.\n\n**For skin types** : oily and acne-prone. but only this combo.\n\n**texture and appearance** : pale yellow. thick and balmy texture like any other sunscreen with silicone. has fragrance . *hybrid sunscreen.*\n\n**ingredients list**: Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylyl Methicone (and) PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Polyhydroxystearic acid, Cyclopentasiloxane (and) Dimethiconol, VP/Eicosene Copolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance.\n\n**Filters** :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tinosorb S (broad spectrum)\n* Uvinul A Plus (photostable      UVA filter)\n* Uvasorb (short spectrum UVB      filter)\n* PARSOL TX (inorganic UV      filter)\n* Titanium Dioxide ( UVB      mineral filter)\n\nI got it when dermaco had just launched and when they had like 4-5 products only. back then I had oily and acne-prone skin since I wasn't on retinoids. it literally melted like butter on skin (looks like too. makhan laga rahe hai-) and is incredibly mattifying. didn't break me out at all. I tried it again when my skin type changed to oily .But this is complete torture for dry skin! makes it even drier 🥲. that's why its better for oily and acne prone skin more! combo skins can try aswell. don't know it functionality as a makeup primer, but has a lot of silicon in it . in terms of sun protection, it does prevent sunburn! not sweat or water resistant tho :( . doesn't give white cast but can cause pilling if your routine is too congested! could be a nightmare to handle in sweltering heat!\n\n**rating** : 3/5 and WNRP since skin type change",

    "body": "Hello.\n\nMy name is Domirillo.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to meet you.\n\nWould you care for a drink?\n\nSince it’s a little chilly outside, I was thinking we could pretend to “get away” by making a margarita. How does that sound? \n\nExcellent.\n\nLet me go ahead and get the ingredients together here.\n\nFirst, lets fill a pint glass with ice and then pour 3-5 oz of mix into the gla...\n\nWhat? This?\n\nIt’s margarita mix.\n\nNo, I don’t know what’s in it. Who do I look like, Don Carlos Orozco?\nWho I think maybe invented the margarita.\n\nFine, I’ll read the ingredients: Water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate, cellulose gum, gum acacia, polysorbate 60, natural flavors, glycerol ester of wood rosin, sodium metabisulfite, yellow 5, blue 1. \n\n...yeah, now that you mention it. I don’t know what half of those words even mean. But look, it’s made by Jimmy Buffet’s own hands, and it says right on the bottle, “Pair the refreshing taste of Margaritaville Lime Margarita Mix with Margaritaville Tequila and get ready to enjoy a premium margarita with every spin of the blender.”\n\nSee, it says “premium” right there. So I think that must be what those words that I didn’t understand were. Those are the premium ingredients. Which explains why they’re so hard to spell. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFuck, I can’t do this anymore. I feel gross just pretending to think that crap is ok.\n\nI guess I need to take a few steps back, and actually explain what the hell you’re reading right now, for those uninitiated. \n\nI’m Domirillo. I work on Archer. At one point during the making of season 2, I noticed that Adam Reed had put a lot of very specific cocktails and other kinds of alcohol into his scripts, and thought it might be fun to share the weekly cocktails on reddit, with a bit of history of the drink, how to make it, and any other esoterica that doesn’t really have to do with the show, because nobody likes spoilers.\n\nThe idea is simple: If you were Archer, you’d be drinking right now. So, when you’re watching Archer each week, you should probably be drinking then too. I’m trying to make that easy for you. Plus, if you stop drinking for too long, the cumulative hangover might literally kill you.\n\nOK, back to the margarita mix.\n\nI talked about the [history and possible origin of the margarita](http://www.reddit.com/r/ArcherFX/comments/klmop/the_tip_s3e02_heart_of_archness_part_ii/) back in Season 3, but I didn’t spend much time covering the fact that every grocery store on the planet has enough pre-mixed concoctions to drown every puppy that has ever lived on the planet of earth. Now, while I don’t need to belabor the point that most of these mixes are disgusting and filled with chemicals that are only needed because they’re using such terrible quality ingredients to begin with. Your margaritas don’t need to last through a nuclear winter. They just need to last you through the weekend. If that. \n\nOver at the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/30/the-best-margarita-mixes_n_1459430.html), they make the argument that the only reason that you need to purchase a mix, is if you’re making a HUGE amount of these bad boys, for a party or whatever, and thus don’t feel like squeezing limes all day like a field hand. \n\nWhile I appreciate that this scenario might happen every now and then, and might happen every day at mexican restaurants around the world, how many times has it happened at **your** fucking house? I bet the answer can be counted on an amputee's hand. You have no reason to make 14 margaritas in one setting. Unless you’re... well, I guess unless you actually ARE Archer, in which case, you wouldn’t be making them anyway. You’d be having your valet make them, and he’d be squeezing every single margarita by hand from nothing but Boca Chita Key Limes.\n\nThere are only 5 things that need to be in your \n\n**MARGARITA**\n\n * 1.5 oz (45 ml) Tequila \n * .5 oz (15 ml) Cointreau (orange liqueur) \n * 1 oz (30 ml) Fresh squeezed lime juice\n * Large ice cubes\n * Kosher Salt for the rim of the glass\n\nPour some salt onto a small dish. Cut a lime in half, use one half to moisten the rim of your glass, then dip the rim in your salt. Juice the lime. One lime (depending on size) should get you a tad more than an ounce of juice. Pour lime juice, Cointreau, and tequila in a cocktail shaker, with ice. Shake vigorously. Pour over ice into your pre-salted glass. Garnish with a lime wedge if desired. (Hint: you desire it).\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n**ALTERNATE**: Drink Irish Cream out of the bottle. \n\n**FOOD SUGGESTION**: Honestly, are you asking this? Seriously? \n\nIt’s a burger.\n\nIf you want to have a little cookout, and make your own, [this is a pretty solid direction.](http://www.shape.com/dinner/gorgonzola-burgers-cucumber-yogurt-sauce)\n",

I also used Colby Jack Moneterey instead of just Monterey.  \n\nThoughts: Really good. Creamy, and the vast variety of cheese types did not clash but worked together extremely well. In this case for a baked M&C, the lack of adding any breading worked out perfectly as the top layer developed a nice crispness after the 30 min in the oven.  \n\nEnd score: 8/10: My roommates ate all of it within about 15 minutes, and I really liked it myself.  \nNext Time: I'm going to play around with sodium citrate, any chefs out there please PM me with advice. Also may be trying Gruyere cheese. Down the comfort-food rabbit hole we go!  \n\nEdit: After eating a bit more, here are my considerations for the future:  \nMore sharp cheddar for sure  \nI might have to delve into this mustard thing more, because it definitely changed the taste for the better.  \nA little less Velveeta, try sour cream, cream cheese, or a combination of both next time.  \n~~I feel like garlic should be in the equation. Maybe garlic salt next time?~~  \n\nReheat update: So I saved a little bit, and just rewarmed it back up to see how it well it lasted on the reheat scale. It was still good, but only about a 7/10 now. The savory/cheesiness kinda went away. Good news it was up to 9/10 with ketchup (If anyone else does that like I do for leftover M&C)\n",

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed! You do need access to the database if you want to read them in its entirety, but you can get some brief information on the topic just through the abstract.\n\nFermenting red ginseng enhances its safety and efficacy as a novel skin care anti-aging ingredient: in vitro and animal study.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23126662\n \nEvaluation of tyrosinase inhibitory and antioxidant activities of Angelica dahurica root extracts for four different probiotic bacteria fermentations.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254340\n\nSkin resistance to UVB-induced oxidative stress and hyperpigmentation by the topical use of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8-fermented milk supernatant.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28598022\n\nBifidobacterium-fermented soy milk extract stimulates hyaluronic acid production in human skin cells and hairless mouse skin.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12637786",

Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

I'm making some top 10-20s for each category for those of you guys who cannot read Korean or don't use the app. Thanks!\n\nIngredients from various websites, double checked with ones from Hwahae, or typed straight from Hwahae.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** \\[**BEPLAIN\\] Cicaful Ampoule - 4.34/5 (3,174 Reviews)**\n\n30ml/29,000 KRW\n\nCentella Asiatica Extract, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyglycerin-3, Pentylene Glycol, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Sodium Hyalutonate, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Lactobacilius/Rice Ferment, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Xantham Gum, 1,2 Hexanediol, Ethyhexylglycerin.\n\n*The few reviews I have read for this say that it absorbs fast, is pretty soothing, and some people state that it really helped their acne. The expectation seems to be that it's supposedly very good for acne prone skin. There are pictures of someone with pretty bad acne showing before and after pictures of their acne going away. (Korean skin care is more geared toward CALMING & SOOTHING acne than to go to war with it with drying treatments and whatnot. I guess because a large component of acne is inflammation?)* \n\n*Some people said it doesn't seem to do anything for them, sensitive types seems to like it a lot, that it absorbs quickly. They like that it's unfragranced. Some VERY oily types said they feel like their skin is a little bit more oilier when they use it and that it doesn't absorb well for them. It may be really popular due to Director Pi suggesting it as the #1 soothing ampoule in her recent video. I see Director Pi's name pop up quite a lot in reviews in general.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvm5b0doc8731.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=75f5866f4847487e1271f277ff8db20353b394b0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. \\[BADSKIN\\] Collagen BOMB Hydrating Ampoule - 4.28/5 (5,002 Reviews)**\n\n400ml/24,000 KRW (400ml ampoule??!)\n\nHydrolyzed Collagen, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Water, 1,2 Hexanediol, Trehalose, Carylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Propanediol, Brassica Olearacea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Medicago Sativa (Alfalfa) Extract, Brassica Oleracea Capitata (Cabbage) Leaf Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Brassica Campestris (Rapeseed) Extract, Raphanus Sativus (Radish) Seed Extract, Betaine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Aspalathus Linearis (Rooibos) Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hyaluronic Acid.\n\n*Reviews for this basically say that this is ULTRA moisturizing. A little bit on the heavier side so oily skin may not like it, but all the dry skinned people seemed to really, really love this. It's cheap, very hydrating, absorbs well. However, a few oily people said it takes a little bit to sink in for them.*\n\n[BIG](https://preview.redd.it/d2pcet1rc8731.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e4fac533d2f3f52e206e338e85a10c33fc69df5)\n\nB I G\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. \\[Manyo Factory (Witch Factory)\\] Bifida Complex Ampoule - 4.21/5 (5,368 Reviews)**\n\n50ml/35,000 KRW\n\nBifida Ferment Lysate, Lactobacillus/Pumpkin Fruit Ferment Filtrate, Niacinamide, Butylene Glycol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Aureobasidium Pullulans Ferment, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Glycerin, Physalis Alkekengi Fruit Extract, Caffeine, Hydrolyzed Algin, Red Ginseng Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Methyl Gluceth-20, Epigallocatechin Gallate.\n\n*This is a very popular product. This and their Galactomyces Niacin Ampoule have been consistently on #1/somewhere in the top 20 list since their debut in 2012 according to Director Pi. This ampoule has been #1 for like forever from what I'm gleaming. However, their expiry is 2 years unopened, and 6 months opened. Supposedly studies done by Estee Lauder say that bifida ferment has been shown to strengthen your skin barrier over time and make it less sensitive to things. Director Pi says ferments provide very, very gentle form of exfoliation.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chi00fdvc8731.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a191ba338f59eaa0c66ece19e1e3b5311c87dfa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. \\[SCINIC\\] First Treatment Essence - 4.16/5 (5,282 Reviews)**\n\n150ml/19,800 KRW\n\nGalactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Adenosine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Water, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Rubus Coreanus Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b08iueb0d8731.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=163f45d2760c17dfc195db29d3e667246a7c272c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. \\[TORRIDEN\\] Dive-in Serum - 4.42/5 (1,127 Reviews)**\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Trehalose, Betaine, Propanediol, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Ceramide NP, Beta-Glucan, Malachite Extract, Cholesterol, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Acrylate/Acrylic Acid Copolymer, PVM/MA Copolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Xantham Gum, Tromethamine, Carbomer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract.\n\n*This looks like Hada Labo lotions tbh. :o Except with more skin soothing things like panthenol, witch hazel, madecassoside, allantoin and such.

By adding sodium citrate, instead of melting into a grease slick the processed cheese will stay in emulsion and melt into gooeyness. \n\nIf left to cool it then solidifies into gum. \n\nAdd more water to this recipe and you have cheese sauce. Or switch the cheeses up and make the next Provel.  Using a different blend of cheeses, it makes [the worlds best macaroni and cheese](http://modernistcuisine.com/recipes/silky-smooth-macaroni-and-cheese/). \n\nSodium citrate can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Grade-Non-GMO-Sodium-Citrate/dp/B00PKHAQDY) for cheap. \n\nI have yet to make pizza with it but I did create a sandwich using it: The St. Loubano. Italian bread, red sauce, Provel cheese, pepperoncini, Genoa salami, Missouri ham, barbecue pork steak and made according to [Serious Eat's Cubano recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/cuban-sandwich-recipe.html).\n\n**Homemade Provel**\n\n* 500 g provolone\n* 250 g Swiss\n* 250 g white cheddar\n* 300 g water\n* 36 g sodium citrate\n* 1/2 tsp liquid smoke (ended up being too much)\n\n1. Shred the cheese.\n2. Mix the water, sodium citrate, and liquid smoke over medium heat until bubbling.\n3. Add the shredded cheese a handful at a time, mixing until melted before adding more.\n4. Mix like the dickens when you've added the last bit of cheese. Don't use a blender like me. This cheese is too thick.\n5. Pour into a container to congeal.",

Long review for a toner with a long name.  ](https://preview.redd.it/7z31ebpe0xp11.jpg?width=3120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51291a489379e7905d9af56cb96020811c461191)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Seed Extract, Natto Gum, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterols, Ceramide 1, Ceramide 2, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 5, Ceramide 6 II, Inositol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Allantoin, Trehalose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate\n\nPrice: $13-$14 for a 4oz glass bottle or $8-$9 for a refill packet from amazon.jp \n\nMy skin type: dry, acne prone, hella sensitive with texture issues. \n\nMy current routine:\n\n(AM) 3 layers of this toner, Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion mixed with Stratia Liquid Gold, Black Girl Sunscreen\n\n(PM) Cleanse, 7 layers of this toner, Etude House Soon Jung Barrier Intensive Cream mixed with Stratia Liquid Gold -- On Sundays, I apply Stratia Soft Touch before toner and one Wednesdays if my skin is particularly clogged I'll use The Ordinary's Salicylic Acid %2 all over. If not I just spot treat on that day when necessary. \n\nI also only started mixing Liquid Gold in with my moisturizers this week since I've been patch testing off and on for a while.\n\nReview: \n\nAlright, so I had this entire review typed up and I don't know what the hell happened to it so I'm going to try and make this one better lol. \n\nFirst, let's talk about the packaging and the price. For $13 you 4 fl ounces of toner in a frosted glass bottle that looks elegant af. I feel so bougie just holding it. The glass is a little thick so the bottle has some weight to it so that's just additional points on the bougie scale. \n\nThe toner itself has a pretty damn sweet ingredients list if I do say so myself. Short and filled with a bunch of stuff my skin has just been loving. It has five different types of ceramides (not the golden ration but tbh I didn't need it to be), rice bran extract, allantoin (which is healing af), sodium hyaluronate and different forms of soybean which overall make this hella nourishing. It's fragrance-free and from the description on the brands website, geared towards sensitive oily skin (I think any skin type could potentially benefit from it but as always ymmv)\n\nI've been using it for about a month and a half and initially didn’t think it was doing anything for me. At the time I was struggling with irritation because my skin suddenly started hating Cerave products which caused my wallet and I to cry. This is what my routine was looking like at that time.\n\n(AM) iUnik Hyaluronic Acid toner (1 layer), Etude House Soon Jung Emulsion, Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Biore Rich Watery Essence\n\n(PM) Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, Etude House Soon Jung toner, iUnik Hyaluronic Acid toner, Etude House Barrier Intensive Cream, Egyptian Magic Balm\n\nAfter I dropped both Cerave products (and the Biore sunscreen) and finished patch testing this, I put it in place of my Etude House toner (which is now a mist). My iUnik toner was overshadowing this toner for about a week or two (and stinging my face ever so slightly) so I gave up on it and decided to use the other half of the bottle on my body. Once I did that, it made it easier for this toner to really show through. \n\nThis toner is watery and doesn't take long to sink into my skin but it doesn't just disappear afterwards either. Whether it be three layers or seven, my skin is still left with this glow to it and feels super soft and moisturized. Any tightness it gone and I experience no stinging whatsoever which is shocking since even my most gentle products would sting any areas that Cerave had irritated even weeks after cutting out Cerave. The moisture lasts a long time too. I can go off and do something mid routine and come back an hour later and my skin is still moisturized with just the toner. \n\nWhat solidified this product into HG status for me was how it's helped my skin these past two weeks. I've been using Stratia Soft Touch once a week for a while and wanted to test out moving my usage up to twice a week, once on Sundays and then on Wednesdays. Well I didn't experience any irritation afterwards so it seemed like my skin responded well…… until the next day. After coming home from work that evening I noticed my skin was really flaky, like I could lightly rub my face and see little flakes appearing everywhere. I wasn't sure if this was a normal thing or not so I waited two days, keeping my routine the same minus any actives of course. The flaking seemed to get a bit worse and the area around my nose was the flakiest so I decided my best bet would probably be to layer the toner more in both routine and stick to the EH SJ cream instead of the emulsion for the time being. \n\nBefore a week had gone by, my skin had turned around quite a lot and I know the toner played a huge part in it since the Etude House doesn't do much on its own. It's purpose is to be a clean, simple sensitive-friendly moisturizer and it does that perfectly well. It just hasn't had the healing power on its own against the issues I'd been dealing with with my skin lately. \n\nAnyways, in the long run, after using this toner my skin seems to have normalized. It doesn't require heavy products to maintain its moisture and it's soft as a babys skin all over. My textural issues are pretty much gone and I know that Stratia Soft Touch has definitely been helping a lot with that. My skin has a nice glow now and looks and feels healthy. I haven't ever been this pleased with a toner and knowing that it's only less than $10 to buy a refill pretty much guarantees that I won't be buying another toner. I get everything I needed and more from this and I couldn't be happier. \n\nI am curious about the Rich version of this toner though but I'll wait and see how this light version does in the winter time before I consider buying another toner. \n\nIf there's anything else you wanna know when it comes to my experiences and thoughts let me know. I don't review stuff often so I'm bound to have missed some things. I just knew that when I was looking up this product there weren't many reviews and I wanted to make sure that if someone else was interested in this product there was at least one more review out there for them to read.

I introduced it after the unscented Klairs Supple Prep toner completely wrecked my skin after a few uses - my face was painfully irritated, dry and flaky with red patches and my trusted bland products either stung (TO NMF) or didn't really help (squalane). This toner fixed all that in a matter of days, I couldn't believe it! I agree with everything in your review and also think it will become a HG for me, unless I like the Rich version even better (I have a sample to test out). It layers easily and is just an all-around pleasure to use. I highly recommend this to anyone whose skin is too sensitive for other toners out there!\n\nEdited to add: OP, having tried both the Matsuyama and Soon Jung toners, are you still gonna repurchase the Soon Jung to use as a mist or do you think it's redundant? I'm really interested in the whole Soon Jung line and have been wondering whether there's still a point in trying out the toner.",

For those out of the know, nacho cheese sauce, and other smooth processed/commercial cheese sauces use a citrate salt to make the sauce smooth and gooey. As far as I know there are several options of citrates-- sodium citrate and potassium citrate being the most commonly used as food additives. \n\nThe options I'm weighing are sodium citrate and potassium citrate. Does anyone work with these or have a preference? I'm thinking potassium citrate might be a better option since its also an easy dietary source of potassium (as opposed to extra sodium) but its more than twice the price by weight so I thought I would try and ask to see if anyone has a preference or if anyone has noted a taste/behavior/texture difference between the two. Lastly if anyone knows of an even better food additive to make cheese sauces gooey please let me know and I will look it up as well.",

    "body": "A couple days ago, someone posted a recipe for a Frosty that involved sweetened condensed milk and Cool Whip. I commented with a rough recipe that I had not tested. Now I have, and I offer you my take:\n\n* 2 tablespoons cocoa powder\n* 1 tablespoon powdered sugar\n* 1-2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum\n* pinch salt\n* 1 cup (8oz) milk (I used 2%, but you could do anything, including nondairy)  \n* 2 cups ice cubes\n\nAdd all ingredients except ice cubes to a blender and blend on high until incorporated. Add the ice cubes and blend on high until thick. My blender has a stick to stir, and that came in handy; you may have to stop and scrape it down if yours does not.\n\nNotes: Alternately, use chocolate milk in place of cocoa, sugar, and milk. I used on the low end on the sugar and it was fine for me, but if you want more like the real deal, load 'er up. More xanthan gum would make it thicker, but too much and it will get gummy; 1/2 teaspoon left it loose, but still creamy.\n\nXanthan gum is an emulsifier/thickener/stabilizer made from fermented bacteria. It's used frequently at home in gluten-free baking to sorta mimic the action of gluten in wheat flour. Here, it makes the frosty into a creamy emulsion without adding much else extra. They carry it in my normal grocery store - look on the baking aisle in the alternative flours area - but somewhere like Whole Foods or Amazon would definitely have it. I got a $12 bag of Bob's Red Mill that will last me at least a year, and I use it a lot.\n\nWendy's Canadian site [lists their ingredients](https://menu.wendys.com/en_CA/product/chocolate-frosty/) as: Milk, Sugar, Glucose, Cream, Whey Powder, Skim Milk Powder, Cocoa, Guar Gum, Mono and Diglycerides, Cellulose Gum, Carrageenan, Calcium Sulfate, Sodium Citrate, Dextrose, Natural Flavour. You have milk and derivatives, two kinds of sugar, cocoa, and emulsifiers/thickeners. So, mine's a pretty darn close version.",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here’s a looong review post of many of the products I’ve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I’m a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don’t wear makeup on a daily – or even weekly – basis. I’ve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I’m in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I’m average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I’ve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently… boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it’s fine. This is many people’s holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It’s affordable, nice pump, doesn’t try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don’t love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It’s standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn’t remove all makeup, it’s as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture – doesn’t feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don’t leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that’s fine, so I don’t know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it’s important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they’re pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it’s a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that’s about it. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula’s Choice wouldn’t have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don’t think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It’s an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don’t really know if it’s very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don’t have the data. I hope it is, though. I’m also worried that it’ll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It’s one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time… And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. It’s impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN’s products, so beware. Just because it says it’s natural fragrance, doesn’t mean it won’t mess with your skin. The word “natural” isn’t even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we’ve found we’re all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It’s a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn’t use it during the daytime. I’m not currently using it, because I’m trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn’t really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don’t know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm… I don’t know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol’ retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn’t released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it’s even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don’t know. I think I’ll wait a while longer to see if there’s any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn’t really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it’s a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn’t contain any preservatives. I wouldn’t recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin’. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You’ve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you’re from Northern Europe. Anyway, it’s a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it’s great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don’t want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It’s called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you’re allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you’re allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It’s my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I’m too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It’s gel-like, but it doesn’t melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn’t seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn’t sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don’t buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn’t all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it’s called a night mask, it’s a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this… right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don’t. I’m not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don’t know. My skin is normal, so I don’t really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I’d appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I’ve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn’t contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don’t really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention… It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it’s bad for your skin. Anyway, it’s an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because… I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I’ll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it’s 10% glycolic acid it’s still very gentle, and that’s probably because it’s in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven’t used it recently because I’m using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn’t ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don’t have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I’m quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don’t need one, I’m just so extra. It’s a HG product for me, because it’s the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it’s great if you have sturdy skin, and you’re lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won’t oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of… dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it’s not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you’re looking for a vitamin c product. It’s perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won’t cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn’t make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Avène Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: …why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there’s that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven’t seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven’t been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don’t particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I’ll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so…\n\n**NAME:** Avène Ysthéal intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as “Avène RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream”, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don’t know what retinaldehyde is, well, it’s one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol à retinaldehyde à retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Avène’s lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don’t have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I’m only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I’ve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you’re 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn’t seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They’ve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you’re pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8’s retinaldehyde products, plus it was Avène that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that I’ll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

    "body": "[Based on an idea that came from The Human Miracle Cure](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lho3rc/the_human_miracle_cure/)\n\nDisease: The Great Plague.\n\nNobody knows where the plague originated from. We still don't know if this was xenobiological warfare, a natural occurrence, or simply a lab mistake that had gotten out of control. All we knew was that it was deadly. \n\nEntire worlds had died from this plague. No living being, plant, animal or mineral seemed immune. In the entire 500 million years of combined scientific studies, no member of the Federated Worlds had every seen a disease vector that so highly contagious  and so lethal over such a total range of biological types.\n\nData on the plague itself is sketchy, at best. Once infected, every living creature became a plague vector and could pass on the plague immediately. It is unknown how long the plague could survive on a fomite, since the plague itself has never been identified as bacterial, viral, or fungal, or mineral.\n\nPhase One - incubation, lasted anywhere from 10 standard hours to unknown maximum. Simply put, there was no way to create a temporary quarantine system to prevent the spread of the plague. It is unknown how many victims of the plague went from Phase One to Phase Two. \n\nPhase Two presented as what most species referred to as \"the common cold.\" Fevers, coughs, nasal discharge, shortness of breath, achy muscles, joint pain, hair loss, hair growth, rapid growth or disintegration of crystallized structures, lost of senses including, but not limited to the sense of touch, smell, taste, and empathy. Duration of Phase Two was 48 std. hours to 90 std. days. It is estimated that 100% of Phase Two patients entered Phase Three without proper treatment. \n\nUpon Phase Three - death. Fatality rate is 100%. Once Phase Three began, individuals had between 30 seconds or two hours depending on previous health levels. Death occurred with the complete breakdown of all bodily molecules into their elemental components, with the accompanying sound of \"Bloop.\"\n\nBecause of the randomness of the incubation time, the Federation Science and Medical Councils determined that the Federation would cease to exist in 5 std. years. With known interspecies contact, all life in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy would end within 100 years. It was theorized that, because of the unknown survival duration of the plague on fomite, this plague could wipe out all life in our galaxy eventually.\n\nTerrans discovered the cure: A solution of acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and phenylephrine found common medicines such as DayQuil, combined with a solution of Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium citrate, sodium benzoate found in common products like Sprite, and chicken noodle soup\\*.\n\nOnce cured, individuals could no longer pass the plague on.  \n\n\n\\* If you have no Terran chickens to consume, it is quite possible you have a convenient alternative. Simply access the Terran section of the Federation Database  under the heading of \"Tastes Like Chicken\" and search for foods palatable to your species.",

Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵* *In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.*\n\n*Another study* *show**ed* *that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶*\n\n*More notes: First study comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D.*\n\nHiyas!\n\nMany of you love Kiku's High Moist, so I picked it up the last time I went to my local Murakai market in SoCal so I could try it out and figure out what all the hype was about.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***\\*\\*,\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extrac\\*\\*\\*\\*t)\\**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

Please do like, share,  subscribe and don't forget to hit the bell icon!... lmao jk\n\n**Skin Type** : Oily - Combination, Comedonal Acne Prone, Rosacea Prone,\n\n**Major skin concerns** : Hypersensitivity, Non inflammatory acne, Sebum Production. \n\n**Age** : Early - Mid 20s, F\n\n**Current Climatic Conditions** : Semi- Arid, Dry winter \n\nSpecie : Homo Sapien\n\nHeight : wait.. I'm not supposed to divulge all these details! \n\n**Product reviews** :\n\n*Note* : None of these products have been used by me on a strictly daily basis, except for a week (or two) in a row during vacations, as I rarely step out of the house (lockdown, duh!) and don't apply sunscreen indoors (\\*gaasp\\* 😨)   \n Rest assured, I've reapplied some when out, and have used them on and off in a span of 6 months. \n\nFrom L-R \n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/s2C99g0N/IMG-20211119-184403.jpg\n\n\n**1-  Nivea Sun Protect And Moisture, moisturising sun and collagen protection SPF 50+ PA++++** \n\n**Quantity** **- Price** : 125 ml - ₹495 MRP\n\n(bought on Amazon for ₹396)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua, Octocrylene, Glycerin, Titanium Dioxide, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Alcohol Denat, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Panthenol, Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides, Myristyl Myristate, Silica, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Stearyl Alcohol, VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Methylparaben, Dimethicone, Trisodium EDTA, Ethylparaben, Sodium Citrate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Citric Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Linalool, Limonene, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol, Eugenol, Coumarin, Methyl Benzoate, Benzoic Acid, BHT, Parfum/Fragrance\n\n**Texture** : White - Chalky Color. Medium - Thick Consistency   \n , you have to rub it in for a while for it to get completely absorbed, medium drying speed. Kinda greasy, semi matte finish. Leaves a moderate white cast, not a ghastly one though. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. Smells mostly of Alcohol! (it's one of the ingredients, so obviously..), fragrance is definitely not unnoticeable, but I don't mind it for my body, lingers around for a while. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : Hell yeah! It won't wear off unless you bathe, it survives water splashes and friction from clothes. Be careful while applying it on your feet though, I slip a lot while walking, esp when there's a rush and I put on sandals right after applying it. Give it ample time to dry before stepping out. \n\n**Reapplication** : Since the lotion sits thick on the skin, reapplication is not a bliss, the white cast becomes more noticeable after reapplication, and if you sweat after, oh god it feels a heavy /sticky mess lol, also tends to attract dust, but it's for the body, so I can compromise. 🤷‍♀️\n\n**Overall experience** : It's the best body sunscreen I've tried so far, with the highest protection and I think the brand can be trusted for its spf claims. \n\nI tried using it on my face once, oh nooo, I will never do that again! it kept moving around and just wouldn't get absorbed, plus it stung like hell because of the alcohol, and I literally felt like I was applying fevicol!   \n For my body, yep a thumbs up! \n\n\\*But\\*, if you get acne on your arms  (my arms have a tendency to break out / get textured if I use the wrong product) it wouldn't be the best choice, it seals and chokes the pores, I'd prefer something lighter. I usually wear tops/suits with long sleeves, so not much of the arm is exposed. below the elbow it feels comfortable enough. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WRP**, Hit! (for the body) \n\n**2- Iba Halal Invisible Sunscreen SPF 50 PA++++**   \n **Quantity - Price** : 80 ml - ₹395 MRP\n\n(I bought it on Amazon for ₹ 337)\n\n**Ingredients** : WATER CONTAINING EXTRACTS OF ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) EXTRACT & HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) WATER, WATER & ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE & BENZOPHENONE-3 & BUTYL METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE & PHOSPHOLIPIDS & 1,3-BUTYLENE GLYCOL & PHENOXYETHANOL, GLYCERINE, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL AND TRIETHYLENE GLYCOL, ETHYLHEXYL METHOXYCINNAMATE, ALUMINIUM STARCH OCTENYLSUCCINATE, NIACINAMIDE (VITAMIN B3), TITANIUM DIOXIDE, PERFUME, DISODIUM EDTA, SODIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n**Texture** : White color. Light lotion - cream consistency, very lightweight and water like, kind of runny, it trickles down when you place a dallop on the palm and tilt it.   \n The Best consistency of a sunscreen I've used so far! Not at all heavy, takes some time to dry, esp when using larger amounts (I use 2-3 finger lengths) and still it doesn't feel too much on my face, easy to work with, requires a lot of gentle massaging because it's watery and takes some time to dry and settle in. High dry time.   \n It contains no silicones! My oily skin loves it! Doesn't give a matte finish though, on the glossy (satin?) side, but nothing bothersome.  \n Doesn't leave a white cast! On the Low I'd say, because of the presence of Titanium Dioxide. Absolutely love the texture. Skin feels very hydrated and plump and non greasy. (taaza nikhaar 😆) \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Has a \"fresh\" smell, (bamboo room freshener? idk something like that), moderate level, doesn't linger a lot. I haven't found a \\*good\\* fragrance free budget (\\*my\\* budget) friendly sunscreen yet. So I'm okay with this for now. Sometimes I'm guilty of enjoying the fragrance 😅 because all other products I use are strictly fragrance free. \n\n**Water Resistant?** :  Nope, doesn't survive water splashes or sweat (it won't come off completely in a single splash though, will wash off when sweating profusely) white colored droplets roll down the face if out in the sun for long. (the survival time is slightly more than the La Shield urban protection mineral sunscreen gel though) \n\n**Reapplication** : Breezy! Since it's lightweight, although, you might experience some moving around if there's a \\*lot\\* of product, I'd suggest applying pea by pea instead of taking a finger length at one go, I squeezed out a good amount once while in the car and kept massaging it in for a couple minutes (or more) and felt embarrassed at the weird looks my family and people outside the car gave me.. So yeah.. lol.  It doesn't feel uncomfortable after layers have been built up. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I love it! Although I'm not sure if the sunscreen has undergone the required tests to justify the actual sun protection claims, but that's all I got so far, it fits my requirements of no silicones, negligible white cast, high declared protection, non oily texture, and most importantly budget! \n\nOne important point, it stings when used after physical / chemical exfoliation. So you may want to avoid it after threading / waxing / scrubbing / masking / exfoliating.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Hit! **WRP** (for face) \n\n**3- La Shield Pollution Protect Mineral Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹280 MRP\n\n(bought it on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Purified Water, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Diisopropyl Sebacate, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Caprylyl Methicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Diisopropyl Adipate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Cetearyl Alcohol, Brassica Campestris/Aleurites Fordi Oil Copolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Phenoxyethanol, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, C20-22 Alcohols, Isohexadecane, Fragrances, Aluminium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 60, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trolamine, Disodium Edetate, Sorbitan Isostearate\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Light - Medium gel - cream consistency. Lightweight. Doesn't require a lot of rubbing in. Doesn't move around a lot. Leaves a Low- Moderate white cast. Not the kind typical to mineral sunscreens, but more than the Iba Halal sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. \\~Medium. Lingers.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Naah, it melts away almost instantly if you happen to sweat while applying it, just a spray (accidental rain drop for example) on the face and it wears off from that spot, minor sweating and it rolls down the cheeks, doesn't adhere to the skin. \n\n**Reapplication** : Medium ease. Moves around, kind of sticky when built up. Medium White cast (visibly noticeable) after reapplication. \n\n**Overall Experience** : Um, I had expected a better performance from this one, looking at the ingredients and all, but it stings around the eyes, and on the face, makes my face somewhat tacky, my face becomes oily by afternoon (if applied in the morning). Personally I didn't like it.\n\n**Repurchase Status** : Miss. **WNRP**.\n\n**4-  La Shield Fisico Matte Sunscreen Gel SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹630 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹441)\n\n**Ingredients** : Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Methicone, PEG-12 Dimethicone/PPG-20 Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate\n\n**Texture** : White color, pasty. Very thick, \\*very\\* silicone-y (it's silicone based.. So), chokes the skin, spreadability is good, doesn't require a lot of massaging in, quick dry time. Moderate - slightly high white cast. Makes my face sweat! \n\n**Fragrance** : No. Silicone like.\n\n**Water Resistant?** : Definitely. Strong staying power. Survives sweating and water splashes too well. Requires double cleanse or a heavy duty face wash to remove. \n\n**Reapplication** : Hahaha! Go ahead and try it if you want to look like a freshly frosted cake! Don't even \\*think\\* about it. Unless you plan to scare people with your literal white walker look. Been there, done that. I'm forever terrified, and will \\*never\\* do it again.\n\n**Overall Experience** : It's a thick paste, Stings around the eyes, which was surprising it being a physical sunscreen (probably because the zinc is micronized? idk) Reapplication is painful, can't apply more than 2 pea sized amount in the first application. Attracts dirt, Chokes my pores, I can't afford to apply something so pore clogging and then strip my facial skin away to remove it.   \n For me, it's not worth the price performance wise.   \n I'm finishing it off as a primer for occasions, smoothes out the face surface, my face gleamed during diwali :P\n\n**Repurchase status** : Miss! **WNRP**.\n\n**5- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Mineral Sunscreen, SPF 50+ PA++++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 50 ml - ₹295 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹236)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water, Zinc Oxide, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isostearic Acid, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Silica, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Perfume, Magnesium Sulphate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Texture** : White Color. Thick cream. Low - medium effort required for blending in the skin. Doesn't move around a lot. Medium - High Dry time. Low white cast (for a mineral sunscreen), medium matte finish. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Medium - High. \n\n**Water Resistant?** : No, doesn't survive low- medium sweating. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. \n\n**Overall Experience** : I haven't used this sunscreen much. My mom used it a few times, and the moment I saw it melting down her face I didn't want to use it. Could have been a great affordable mineral sunscreen, but it's not even mildly water resistant, so I instantly passed on it. Might give it a try in the future. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : **WNRP**. \n\n**6- Joy Revivify Hello Sun Sunblock and Anti Tan Lotion Tinted Sunscreen, SPF 50 PA+++**\n\n**Quantity - Price** : 60 ml - ₹245 MRP\n\n(bought on amazon for ₹196)\n\n**Ingredients** : Aqua/Water,Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Benzophenone-3, Phospholipids, 1,3 Butylene glycol, Propylene Glycol, Glyceryl Monostearate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Kaolin, Water, Butylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Sodium Sulfite, Paeonia Suffruticosa Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract, Saxifraga Sarmentosa Extract, Acetyl Tyrosine, Arbutin, Glutathione, Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Cyclopentasiloxane, Phenyl Trimethicone, Dimethiconol, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, Perfume, Disodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Ci 77492, Ci 77491, Ci 77499\n\n**Texture** : Orange color (literally). Medium consistency lotion like. Lightweight. Medium matte finish. Easy application. Doesn't require much effort to blend in. But the color is a literal disaster, it's impossible to apply a full finger length of this sunscreen. \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. On the Higher side. \n\n**Water Resistant** : Maybe a bit more than the mineral sunscreen variant? Not sure, rubs off on the mask \\*very\\* readily. Haven't noticed orange sweat yet, maybe because I haven't worn it enough. \n\n**Reapplication** : Never tried. But I'm pretty sure it's not possible provided the intense color. \n\n**Overall Experience** : It could have been a good,  affordable tinted sunscreen, but the tint is just a disaster.. It dulls my face overall, and it doesn't even work as a bb cream (or sorts) although I don't expect to provide any coverage as per se (which it doesn't anyhow), but I can't find a way to finish it off other than applying it on my hands. Maybe color corrector?? Omg what'd I just come up with 😃💡. Let's see lol \n\n**Repurchase status** : Nope. **WNRP**. \n\n\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/RVccCB01/IMG-20211119-173651.jpg\n\n**7-** **Malibu LipCare Balm, SPF 30, UVA/UVB** (watermelon variant) \n\n**Quantity - Price** : 5 gm - ₹249-₹299\n\n(bought 2 on amazon for ₹199 each )\n\n**Ingredients** (watermelon) : Petrolatum, Paraffinum Liquidum (Mineral Oil), Paraffin Wax, Ozokerite Wax, Homosalate, Octocrylene, Carnauba Wax, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Flavor  \n May Contain: Limonene, Linalool, Hydroxycitronellal, Citral, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate, Citronellol, Benzyl Alcohol\n\n**Texture** : Ultra Rich, stiff stick, application is not smooth and breezy, tugs and pulls on the lips if you rush it, tightly press it against the surface, let the balm melt and glide on slowly. Makes lips very soft though. Staying power is great! \n\n**Fragrance** : Yes. Watermelon. Strong. \n\n**Taste** : Bitter Af! Avoid applying it on the insides and corners to keep it from seeping in. \n\n**Water resistant?** : Definitely! Survives liquids (tea, water, juice for me) not very heavy meals. Apply a thick layer to fight the mask rubbing off. Stays on for hours, afternoon - evening, for example. Keeps lips very soft and supple, no stinging sensation. \n\n**Overall Experience** : The only lip balm with spf 30 (plus uva/uvb protection) that has all the ingredients disclosed. Can't ask for more.   \n The only issue is, I can't use it with my waterproof /transferproof matte lipsticks. It makes them water loving and easily transferable, need to figure something out for that.. \n\n**Repurchase Status** : Unless I find some other lip balm with spf 30 mentioning all the ingredients, in a more affordable range, with no bitter taste, and better sunscreen filters. I **WRP** this. \n\nThats about it! Congrats for making it this far! Thanks!\n\n*Edited to add links to images, since I couldn't upload them with the post*",

However there maybe instances due to timing etc, where you may not be able to purchase it on line in time for your need.  \n\nI did a bit of research a bit back and found out that you can make sodium citrate from baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and Citric Acid, both of which should be readily available at your local grocer.  \n\nFor every 2.1 g of citric acid, use 2.5 g of sodium bicarbonate and if everything goes well, you'll get 2.9 g of sodium citrate after evaporating all the water. Just mix the two ingredients with which ever liquid you're using (milk or water) and you should be good to go, clearly no need to evaporate the water. \n\ne.g. for the Modernist Cuisine at Home it calls for 11g of Sodium Citrate, so you'd need ~8g (7.96) of Citric Acid and ~9.5g(9.48) to get 11g of Sodium Citrate. \n\nI have yet to try this but it seems like it should work.  Just chemistry. ",

The proper result should be almost neutral (or taste very slightly sour). \n\nI tried to do the math and I got that for every 1 gram of sodium bicarbonate, you want 0.75 grams of citric acid (and you produce 1 gram of sodium citrate plus water and carbon dioxide bi-products). So, e.g., to make 11g sodium citrate, you mix 11g of baking soda and 8.25g citric acid. These ratios seemed to work. \n\nI showed my work here - hopefully I got it right! : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/8arfhd/where_to_buy_sodium_citrate_for_cheese_sauce_today/lyrn0es/",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere.

It goes on really light which I like, but after a while my skin either feels dry, or really oily.

    "body": "NOTE: Sorry for the WEIRD MARKDOWN. The new Reddit's editor is a damn mess and I am constantly cleaning its crummy markdown.\n\nHi, SCA.\n\nSomeone requested more reviews and breakdowns, so I figured I would post this here. I originally posted it in r/AsianBeauty where I got some excellent feedback and thoughts.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***,***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extract)****, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most.\n\nA couple of studies on sake (specifically rice wine and sake extract) showed multiple benefits. One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"⁴ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"⁵In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.\n\nAnother study showed \\*that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.⁶\n\nIt's important to note that the first study I mentioned comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D - a popular skincare company.\n\nWhile these studies are minimal, we may be able to glean some deeper understanding into the benefits of sake by examining two of the most popular (and more studied) ferments as well as koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¹*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"² Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.³*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"²\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was *uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

Virgin hair, never been chemically treated, I don't do any heat styling, no blow-drying. Only Air-drying\n\n[Pic 1, Im turning away from camera](https://imgur.com/a/3YQDuew.jpg). Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse it off.\n\nReview: This is a cult favourite  around here and for very good reason. I use this in the place of a conditioner. This conditions. I get nice, shiny frizz free hair. The cost - benefit was insane and this was HG. Not going to say anything else, because it's not available and it's pointless.  I paid higher than MRP to get my hands on a tub, when I realised it was going to be rEfORmuLAted and I've had no regrets so far.

Straight up applying and mixing it with water, both works equally well. You might use up more if straight up applying it.\n\nReview: This is brilliant protein conditioner. If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

Rohto Mentholatum - Hada Labo Koi-Gokujyun Perfect Gel.** Travel size that I got at a random convenience store while in Japan. Soft gel-like texture. Good in humid weather. Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. Its a decent moisturizer for me in the daytime in the summer. WNR. Again, maybe someone with oily skin may benefit more from this gel.\n\nIngreditents: Water, BG, glycerin, hydroxyethyl urea, pentylene glycol, PPG-10 methyl glucose, triethyl hexanoin, squalane, (acryloyl dimethyl taurine ammonium / VP) copolymer, behenyl alcohol, acetyl hyaluronic acid Na (super hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid Na, hydrolysed hyaluronic acid (nano-ized hyaluronic acid), hyaluronic acid hydroxypropyl trimonium (skin-adsorbed hyaluronic acid), hydrolyzed collagen, glucosylceramide (ceramide), suizenzino-polysaccharide (Sakuran), dimethicone, PPG-17 butes -17, triethyl citrate, cyclopentasiloxane, phenoxyethanol, succinic acid 2Na, dimethicone crosspolymer, agarten, EDTA-2Na, succinic acid, α-glucan, acrylate copolymer ammonium , Methyl paraben\n\n**3. Kansosan Medical Highly Moisturizing Cream.** A buttery and moisturizing cream. While shopping at Donki, I googled what is the best Japanese cream for dry and sensitive skin and Kansosan was suggested so I bought it to try. \n\nIts fantastic on my dry skin. It sinks in upon application but also coats my skin with a layer of moisturizing protection. Ive been using it for 2 days now and all I can think about is how amazing this would be for winters. Im gonna stock up when I go back to Japan. I think I found my holy grail moisturizer. I need to try other products from this brand. \n\nThis cream is like the better formulated version of the Kikumasamune sake cream and the Purito Dermide sleeping pack. Plus Kansosan doesnt smell bad. People who enjoy thick moisturizers like the Illiyoon and Aestura would like this cream.\n\nIngredients: Heparin-like substance\\*, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizinate\\*, Purified Water, Glycerin, Methylphenyl Polysiloxane, Cross-linked Methyl Polysiloxane, Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, 1,3-Butanediol, Methyl Polysiloxane, Polyethylene Glycol-Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, 2-Ethylhexyl Dodecanol, 1,2-Pentanediol, Poly(Oxyethylene-Oxypropylene) Methyl Polysiloxane Copolymer, Isostearic Acid Hardened Oil, Anhydrous Magnesium Sulfate, α-Olefin Oligomer, Sodium Citrate, Glycerol Mono-2-Ethylhexyl Ether, Sodium Metabisulfite, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Citric Acid, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, dl-Alpha Tocopheryl Sodium Phosphate, Vaseline, Glycosyl Squalane, L-Arginine, Hydrogenated Soybean Phospholipid, Plant Sterols, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Water Soluble Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Polyethylene Glycol Octyl Dodecyl Ether, Plant Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate (2), \n\n\\*denotes \"Active Ingredient\", no symbol denotes \"Other Ingredients\"  \n",

    "body": "First time posting, long time follower. My wife and I have been doing lazy keto for about a year, and have lost a combined 65ish pounds or so (we drink a lot :) ).\n\nWe've done some cooking experiments (more coming in the future) and I was shopping on [Modernist Pantry](http://www.modernistpantry.com) for sodium citrate for cheese emulsification when I came across [EverCrisp](https://www.modernistpantry.com/evercrisp-breader-batter-boost.html). Billed as a \"breader and batter boost\", EverCrisp is wheat dextrin, a soluble fiber that is particularly good at absorbing moisture. Being wheat based, it's probably not gluten friendly, though it has no protein, so... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nMore importantly, according to \"A Review of the Role of Soluble Fiber in\nHealth with Specific Reference to Wheat Dextrin\", Slavin et al. (JIMR 2009, 37:1-17), wheat dextrin is indigestible and has no effect on blood sugar levels, may help with mineral absorption (magnesium and calcium primarily), helps with constipation, etc., etc. In short, great for keto diets.\n\nSo, we deep fried some shrimp, with a batter of 20% EverCrisp, 80% coconut flour (plus a pinch of salt and pepper) - dip in a beaten egg, then in the batter. Can go back to the egg and re-batter a second time for a thicker coating - still works great. They came out perfectly golden and crispy. Pics available [here](https://imgur.com/a/w0aFj).\n\nFor a dipping sauce, we made a simple mix of Nature's Hollow Sugar-free apricot preserves, chili paste, and rice vinegar. Probably about 4:1:2 for a ratio, but adjust to taste.\n\nIn the [pics](https://imgur.com/a/w0aFj), it's served alongside a crispy beef stir fry over daikon noodles. Recipe coming soon.\n\nNote - we also tried a hazelnut flour/EverCrisp batter for veal scallopini that did not work - the breading came off as soon as we tried to flip them in the pan. The breading also didn't get crisp, but was kind of mushy. My hypothesis is that the hazelnut flour has more internal oil and moisture than coconut flour, which is particularly dry. I'm guessing that almond flour would probably react similarly to hazelnut flour, but sesame flour may work, since it's defatted.",

Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

This is just an interesting anecdote, but the people that I HAVE seen rave about this intensive repair conditioner are usually people with chemical damage from bleaching. I have never bleached my hair in my life. I would say my biggest concern is maybe mechanical and heat damage on virgin hair. That’s pretty much it. You’re likely seeing good results with it because it has good conditioning ingredients and the formula that your hair likes.",

    "body": "So I spotted the above-named product at the grocery store while meandering past the grooming section.  I picked it up and wondered if it was as good for a primer, as it's neighbor, Nivea Post Shave Balm, has been known to be.  I compared the two products' ingredient lists, and noticed some big differences.\n\n> **Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm**: Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol , Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\n\n> **Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating+**: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 MA Crosspolymer, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, DMDM Hydantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Stearic Acid, Sodium Citrate, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Triethanolamine, Sodium PCA, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Ceramide 3, Phytosphingosine, Cholesterol, Ceramide 6 II, Ceramide 1\n\nThe first thing that jumped out at me was the inclusion of silicone compounds in the Dove shave balm.  It contains cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone.  Silicones are absent from the Nivea balm.  This is a pro or a con, depending on your skin type and the base of your foundation.  \n\nThe second thing I noticed that I liked was the inclusion of ceramides in the Dove balm.  However, they're mostly on the tail end of the list, so it's hard to say how much is actually in the products, and if it is present enough to do any good.  Certainly can't hurt.\n\nThe Nivea balm has the benefit of having tapioca starch in it's formulation, which can be good for oil, and it has Witch Hazel extract.  Both balms have pretty good ingredients.  Neither contains drying alcohol.\n\nSo I purchased it.  When I got home, I washed my face, moisturized as normal, then put the Dove balm on the left side of my face and the Nivea balm on the right side.  I eschewed all other primers.  I dabbed a little Maybelline FitMe concealer under my eyes, and used a RT sponge to apply some L'Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte.  The foundation went on very smoothly and did not cake up or pill.  I set it with NYC loose powder.  I added some blush and bronzer for some depth, then I went about my day.\n\nSix hours later, I surveyed the first round of results.  Aside from my foundation being rubbed off of the tip and bottom of my nose (got the flu), both sides looked okay.  I did noticed, however, that the foundation on the right side of my face was more textured.  I could see my pores way clearer than the other side of my face.  Both sides were moderately oily.  The left side of my face was holding up somewhat better than the right side.  I noticed fewer flakes around the dry spots of my face on the left side.  At eight hours, all of these observations were more pronounced.  I noticed more oil on the right side, enough that my pores were \"shining\" with oil.  It was odd.  Neither side looked bad, however.  But for me, the left side (Dove) was winning out in the overall appearance category.  \n\nSo, for my initial testing, Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm Hydrating did better than Nivea Sensitive Post Shave Balm, as a foundation primer.  Both have pretty good ingredients, both are alcohol free, and each can serve certain skin types better than the other.  Cheers! ",

Just because it takes the # of reviews into account. You can find lots of good reviews vouching for very good products with lesser amount of reviews. It doesn't necessarily mean that just because a product is extremely popular, there can't be lesser known amazing products as well. For some categories, like toners and creams, I feel that it's worth to look all the way down towards the 40s and 50s. I think I will make certain categories longer if you guys don't mind my spamming, lol.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I'm thinking doing creams or gels next. =) Thank you everybody for the comments, glad to see the time I spent making these posts is helping some of you!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Oils & Gels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6dqq7/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing_oils_gels/)\n\n[Top 10 Cleansing Balms/Milks/Creams & Foams](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/c6fso3/guide_hwahae_rankings_top_10_cleansing/)",

Pandemic put a halt to our plans and soon after that my first son was born in August 2020 and I could not get back to training until the end of last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Training\n\nThere's a triathlon community and forum, [slowtwitch.com](https://slowtwitch.com) and every year they have a running challenge that starts in November. The challenge is to run at least 3 miles every day for 100 consecutive days. That was how I started my prep to build the base miles necessary to start the specific marathon training.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI followed the 18/55 Pftiz program, but really struggled with the midweek mid long runs. I did something like 85% of the program mileage. Also I could not do any tune-up race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFavorite part was the MP long runs. That I set PB for the half-marathon in all of them. Did one extra MP long run 2 weeks out from the race, setting another HM PB of 1h28m30s feeling super comfortable and planting the seed that in a perfect day sub3 could be achieved. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Pre-race\n\nMy cousin lives in the US, but came to run the marathon and visit family. In the days prior to the race we hang out a lot, hadn't seen each other for almost 3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWent to bed very early because our start the next day was at 5:20am. Wake up at 3am, had some toast with jam, coffee and a banana.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe temperature was perfect (for Rio), 18C (or \\~70F) at the start, but the ground was very wet and it looked like that heavy rain was incoming (spoiler alert: IT DID!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy nutrition strategy was to consume (70-80g of carbs + 1g of sodium)/hour of a mixture of glucose + frutose + sodium citrate that I carried with me. Also took 2 gu roctane gels at 60-120min for the caffeine. Plus water every 3km at every aid station. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Race\n\nWe started at 5:20am and we were following a big group that was aiming sub3 (there weren't official pacers).\n\nFor the first our we were running through downtown Rio and it was still very dark, that part of the course was very confusing with a lot of turns (contributing to my watch adding 500m to the final distance).\n\n0-10km - I was just focused on staying relaxed and following the group ahead of me and staying safe on the turns. Towards the end of this first part of the course this group (and my cousin) opened a gap to me that I decided to let go and run my race.\n\n10-20km - That was my lowest part of the race. Having let the big group go, running alone and still dark. The pace was holding on, but I wasn't feeling special.\n\n20-35km - Here the sun was rising and we reached the famous Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, there were a lot of people cheering. I started to few good again and saw that I was actually making some ground to the group that I have let go earlier (and that my cousin was). On the other hand, it started to pour rain and my (and everybody else) shoes were soaked until the end of the race.\n\n35-40km - Here I started calculating that if I kept running 4'20/km sub3 was still possible. By km 37 I saw that my cousin was struggling and I was making ground on him quickly. As soon as I got to him I yelled: \"I'm trying to get back to you in the past 20 miles, YOU WILL NOT GIVE UP NOW! Let's go together!\" And start pushing his back to increase his pace.\n\n40km-Finish -  We entered in total focus mode and consumed every bit of energy left to increase the pace and cross the finish line in 2h59m40 in total awe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\### Post-race\n\nI could not believe what had just happened. I did the perfect strategy for the race and kept felling better and better in the course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the months leading to the race my cousin and I always imagined crossing the finish line together, but we hadn't settled on that as we knew that many things could happen in 42km.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo top thing of, later in the night when I got home to my wife and son had the greatest surprise that baby #2 is on the way!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMade with a new \\[race report generator\\]([http://sfdavis.com/racereports/](http://sfdavis.com/racereports/)) created by /u/herumph.",

It's unfortunate you don't like the texture of raw basil, perhaps if you chop it fine it will help. To me the texture is similar to any green (like lettuce or raw baby spinach) so I actually prefer it in big pieces.   \n\nRegarding tomatoes, one of my favorite toppings on pizza is tomato slices (from really, really fresh homegrown tomatoes; I planted 24 tomato plants last year). To avoid them watering the pizza down, I put the slices between layers of paper towels and press on them to dry them out. That sounds a little too simple but it really does work.",

Part one can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/4tt64z/homemade_provel_aka_cheese/).\n\n[We continue our journey with five new flavored Provels.](http://imgur.com/a/GbM4M)\n\n**The Flavors**\n\nPepperovel - Pepperoni + Provel. What else need be said?\n\nRoasted Vegevel - Despite the terrible name, this is a winner.\n\nProvelveeta - A mashup of Provel and Velveeta. Long lost cousins reunite at last, incestuously.\n\nPickel - Pickle juice instead of water. Gross or grossly awesome?\n\nBeervel - The picture lies, the water is replaced with pretzel-infused beer. This one didn't work out so great.\n\n**The Ratios**\n\n100% cheese\n\n30% liquid\n\n3.6% sodium citrate (or 2.625% citric acid and 3.125% baking soda)\n\n1-2 drops of liquid smoke\n\nRandom quantities of other flavorings\n\n**The Citric Acid / Baking Soda Hack**\n\nCitric acid and baking soda react in water to make a form of sodium citrate. If you can't wait for Amazon Prime to deliver sodium citrate, you can still make Provel like a boss *TODAY*. It helps to have a jeweler's scale.\n\nNote: Delirious from a hankering for Provel, I took not so great pictures.\n\nEdit: This recipe is an adaptation from [Modernist Cuisine at Home](https://www.amazon.com/Modernist-Cuisine-Home-Nathan-Myhrvold/dp/0982761015).",

They don't always appear as \"ceramide \\_\\_\", there are other names for them, such as:\n\nHydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, Myristoyl/​Palmitoyl Oxostearamide/​Arachamide MEA, Cetyl-PG Hydroxyethyl Palmitamide, Hydroxypalmitoyl Sphinganine, [Safflower Oil/​Palm Oil Aminopropanediol Esters](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/safflower-oil-palm-oil-aminopropanediol-esters), etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo today I wanted to make a list of products that are easily overlooked when searching for ceramide skincare, because many people are only looking for the word \"ceramide\".

Still probably way higher than most other brands).\n\nThough with these products in general, particularly for the ones with “real” (not pseudo/ceramide precursors), honestly I would be shocked if they were present at more than 0.1 %. Even if they come before the preservatives, the preservatives are probably present at like 0.9% so the company can list them after the fancy ingredients even though the expensive ingredients are at minuscule concentrations. Maybe I’m too cynical, but a >1% concentration of any ceramides would be such a HUGE selling point (not to mention very expensive to produce) that I can’t believe they’re not advertising it\n\nLike Regimen is coming out with one and they are trumpeting the HELL out of it (and I mean fair enough)",

So my Physicians Formula booster and Olay Luminous booster came in the mail today!\n\nI'm just really excited to share because I searched HIGH AND LOW for affordable niacinamide products that have a high % of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO MY PICTURES:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8](https://imgur.com/a/7ab5NZ8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe PF I have not used before.

Probably because Olay developed it. But it works great on its own as a brightener, and even better combined with vitamin c (which is why you see ascorbyl glucoside here, a stable derivative of ascorbic acid). The miracle boost USED to contain n-acetyl glucosamine (which is the one I used) as well the other ones listed here. But I guess it got too expensive or whatever.\n\nThis also has some other great ingredients, like xylitol, gylcerin, panthenol, zinc and copper gluconate for soothing and healing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used this booster in conjunction with the Luminous cream, which has niacinamide and NAG. My skin looked so much brighter and prettier. The texture was really smoothed out and my skin started getting a more like.. translucent ?? quality? You DO need to give brightening ingredients *at least 3 months* to work their magic though, especially for things like arbutin/hydroquinone. (Arbutin breaks down into hydroquinone.) But for niacinamide, I saw results for skin texture/overall brightening before that.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe the price Target was selling it for, because I got it for a much higher price elsewhere before. I couldn't keep affording it so I let it go, sadly. :'(\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe [**Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment ($24.99)**](https://www.olay.com/en-us/skin-care-products/regenerist-luminous-tone-perfecting-treatment) is a simpler formula, but still has the same active ingredients.\n\n*Water,* ***Niacinamide\\*****, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Dimethicone,* ***Undecylenoyl Phenylalanine***\\*, Silica, Boron Nitride,\\* ***Ascorbyl Glucoside***\\*, Polyglyceryl-2 Oleate, Glucosyl Hesperidin, Dimethiconol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Oleate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Benzyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, \\*Vitamin B3\\*\n\nBut ironically, it costs more than the more complex booster if you purchase at Target online.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DIY:**\n\nI have made DIY niacinamide NAG serums before. But because I'm too lazy to make it properly, they really lack penetration power. I'm really into cosmetic science and have read from professional cosmetic chemists that a simple DIY isn't effective if you don't do it right. You gotta keep the powders dissolved right and STAY dissolved instead of them recrystallizing on your skin and not penetrating your skin/being useless. I experimented for months with the DIY but I DEFINITELY noticed a difference as soon as I started using well-formulated, commercially available niacinamide serums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience with certain products:\n\n\\- [**Eva Naturals 5% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-Niacinamide-Serum-Eva-Naturals/dp/B0147PDMYY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=eva+naturals+niacinamide&amp;qid=1561763684&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3)**:** Pretty awesome, works well, you get 2 oz. But it has avocado oil and such, and may break some people out. (This is definitely a private-label product and you can find the same exact formula for cheaper on DIY sites - which is why you see like 324982394 bottles of the same formula of everything from niacinamide to vitamin c serums on amazon.) I get the same sort of overall brightening and translucency I get with Olay. Better results with my other products, Benton 0.5% salicylic acid (very gentle) aloe BHA toner, Purito green level centella buffet serum (also has niacinamide, like 2%), and Naturie Hatomugi gel essence. Bright, translucent skin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **Cerave PM:** Supposedly has 4% niacinamide. Loved this as a lightweight moisturizer, but did NOT see the results I got with other niacinamide products. Makes me feel skeptical. Or perhaps there's a pretty big difference for my skin with 4% and 5%. I doubt it, but you know. Maybe it's just cuz it's formulated for skin-replenishing and not for brightening. But you'd think same ingredient will have same effects, y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- [**Skinlex 10% Niacinamide Serum**](https://www.skinlex.com/product/10-niacinamide-serum-60ml/)**:** Ingredient list looks GREAT and some others seem to love it, but I saw absolutely zero niacinamide benefits for my skin. Penetration issue?\n\nI have other products I've used with niacinamide, but these are the main ones I can remember on the top of my head. La Roche-Posay Lipikar AP+ baume has it as well, but I do not know the %.

It's completely unfragranced but the product itself smells a little... Mouldy? I knew it smelt bad from reviews but I wasn't expecting it to really smell that unpleasant. I'm used to it now though and have a completely unfragranced routine. If you're accustomed to fragranced products I think you'll definitely find this unbearably unpleasant.\n\nI will say the texture itself is quite pleasant. It's got a silky smooth texture that spreads easily. You don't need a lot which is good but I'm definitely using it up more quickly than I was expecting.\n\nI'll probably stick with it for 3 months to see if there's any improvement but at the moment I'm seeing a small improvement in overall skin tone but not much improvement on sun spots that I wanted this product to fade. I do use this after TO Niancinamide so hopefully the peptide brighteners work together!",

    "body": "We had an oncology nurse put in an incident report on my coworker for “not running a patients platelet count on her blue tube”. We have several patients who are known platelet clumpers, and often times we will have to ask the nurse to draw a blue tube and run the platelet count off the blue. Usually the platelets look better on the blue tube but there are sometimes when the platelets actually are better on the purple, so we end up resulting it from the purple instead. Well one day we got a patient who was a known platelet clumper and my coworker actually DID release the platelet count from the blue tube, but for whatever reason, the nurse put in an incident report stating the lab resulted it from the purple tube instead of the blue. First off, they weren’t there and didn’t watch us to see which tube we used, so how do they know?? And like I said, sometimes the results from the purple actually look better than the blue. Second, just like we don’t know anything about their iob, they know nothing about ours. Just yesterday I had a nurse ask me “this is a a stupid question but EDTA is a blue tube, right? It’s not the name of a specific test, is it?” And I had to explain that no, EDTA is not a test, and it’s actually not a blue tube, it’s a purple. I don’t fault her for not knowing. Nurses don’t work in the lab and they aren’t trained on this stuff. But it proves my point that they need to stay in their lane. My supervisors way of dealing with this issue is when we have a patient who is a known platelet clumper, she wants us to put a comment in the patient’s chart that their platelet count was resulted from the sodium citrate tube (or the EDTA, whatever the case might be). This helps cover our asses but ideally how about we tell the nurses that instead of making assumptions that they know nothing about and putting in incident reports on us, how about they call the lab and ask us when they have a question about results. That’s all. Thanks for reading.",

I rarely post on Reddit so, please, bear with me.\n\nFirst and foremost, if this post breaks any rules of the sub please, mods, feel free to remove it and accept my apologies. I checked the sub rules, and I didn't see anything that would imply this isn't allowed, but still want to respect this wonderful space and all it has to offer.\n\nI had a colleague whose lab went out of business, and I offered to help him with some things around the lab. That being said, his group had a ton of compounds (mostly inorganic salts as far as I can tell) that needed to be removed from the premise before they could completely close.\n\nA good number of them are in great condition/unopened and I assume a lot of these are expensive and would hate for them to go to waste, especially if someone near me could get some good (legal) use out of them. I haven't spent a ton of time combing through them, but after a cursory glance none of them jump out at me as being problematic (except for a few nitrates).\n\nI have created a neatly alphabetized list of all the compounds on Excel that I have on hand, and I wanted to ask this community if anyone would be interested in them or knew anyone that could use them. There are nearly 100 compounds in total.\n\nI am sure not all of them will be of use so if anyone has an idea on what kind of company I would need to get in contact with in order to dispose of them I would be open to hearing some suggestions as I think I have gotten myself into in much deeper than I initially expected.\n\nThe lab is in San Diego, California and I am unable to ship any of these compounds out for obvious reasons, so if anyone is in the area and could put them to good use please feel free to reach out to me. I will post the compounds below if it lets me. \n\nSorry it's been a long and hectic week for me, so I apologize if this post is a little disjointed or rambly.\n\n1,4-Diazabicyclo Octane (DABCO)\n4-Chloro-1-Naphthol\nAbsorbic Acid\nAmmonium 15n- Chloride\nAmmonium Acetate\nAmmonium Bicarbonate\nAmmonium Chloride\nAmmonium Molybdate\nAmmonium Molybdate Tetrahydrate\nAmmonium Phosphate Dibasic\nAmmonium Phosphate Monobasic\nAmmonium Sulfate\nAmmonium Nitrate\nAscorbyl Pamitate\nBenzoic Acid\nBetaine\nBoric Acid\nCalcium Acetate\nCalcium Chloride (Anhydrous)\nCalcium Nitrate Tetrahydrate\nCalcium Pantothenate\nCalcium Sulfate\nCarbendazim\nCHT Ceramic\nCobalt (II) Chloride Hexahydrate\nCobalt Sulfate Heptahydrate\nColbalt Chloride\nCongo Red\nCopper Chloride Dihydrate\nCrystal Violet\nD-(+)-Galactose\nD-(-)-Fructose\nD-(+)-Xylose\nEDTA UltraPure\nEthyl Methanosulfate\nFerric Ammonium Citrate\nFerric Chloride Hexahydrate\nFerric Nitrate 9-Hydrate\nFerrous Sulfate\nFerrous Sulfate Heptahydrate\nFructose\nGlycine\nHydranal\nImadazole\nIron Granules\nIron III Chloride Hexahydrate\nL-(+) Arabinose\nL-(+)Potassium hydrogen Tartrate\nL-Tryptophan\nMagnesium Acetate\nMagnesium Acetate Tetrahydrate\nMagnesium Chloride Tetrahydrate\nMagnesium Hydroxide\nMagnesium Nitrate Hexahydrate\nMagnesium Oxide\nMagnesium Sulfate (Anhydrous)\nMagnesium Sulfate Heptahydrate\nManganese Chloride\nManganese Sulfate\nMetronidazole\nOxalic Acid Dihydrate\nPolyethylene Glycol\nPotassium Acetate\nPotassium Acetate (Anhydrous)\nPotassium Hydroxide\nPotassium Nitrate\nPotassium Phosphate Dibasic\nSodium Acetate Anhydrous\nSodium Bicarbonate\nSodium Carbonate\nSodium Citrate\nSodium Molybdate 2 Hydrate\nSodium Nitrate\nSodium Phosphate Dibasic Heptahydrate\nSodium Phosphate Monobasic Monohydrate\nSodium Selenate Anhydrous\nSodium Selenite\nSodium Thiosulfate 5-Hydrate\nSucrose\nUrea Phosphate Salt\nZinc Acetate Dihydrate\nZinc Chloride\nZinc Sulfate\n",

I tried his recipe (fourthed) and it still broke. \n\nThis is basically the same recipe as the book, except it looks like she changed his 45/15 minute cook time to 30/10 minute.\n\n[https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese](https://thefeedfeed.com/danielagerson/the-best-baked-mac-and-cheese)\n\n I have a few ideas of what I can change, but they all seem like a reach.\n\n1. I fourthed his recipe, but did the full bake time (45 mins with tin foil cover, 15 mins without at 375).\n2. I used the reccommended amount of velvetta (which I hate doing but I use it for the sodium citrate) but his recipe calls for sharp cheddar and I've been using smoked cheddar and smoked gouda. Both cheeses are not aged and don't seem like dry cheeses, but maybe there is something about smoking cheeses that makes them break easier?\n3. Maybe I just suck at making a roux. I melt butter, whisk in flour slowly before the butter browns, then whisked in a combination of evaporated milk and whole milk (the recipe does say to do evaoporated milk first now that I look at it), slowly, maybe not slowly enough, but feel like it was...,turned up the burner so the roux bubbled a little bit (definitely not a hard boil), turned it off and added the cheeses (valvetta first). The mixture looked like a good thick, well incorporated bachamel when it  was finished.\n\nI think the cook time/temp is the most likely calprit, heating up the sauce to the degree where it breaks. Or should mac n cheese sauces be able to be 375 degrees without breaking? What does baking a backed mac n cheese do? What's the difference between baking a mac vs just making a stovetop mac, pouring it into a baking dish, sprinkling some breadcrumbs and shredded cheese on top and putting it under the broiler for a couple minutes?\n\n\\* Edit I'm gonna try 20 minutes at 350 covered, then uncover it and broil for 5 minutes/til golden brown. Besides the mac being cold/not hot, how would I know if the baked mac is undercooked? Just too saucy/liquidy/thin opposed to casseroley/solid?",

I whisk the eggs into the evap milk before cooking. After the noodles are cooked (a little underdone), I add butter to the pan with the noodles, stir it up to melt the butter, add the milk and egg mixture, heat it up gently, don't let it boil, or simmer, take off the heat and stir in the cheeses until melted. \n\nIf I was going to do the topping I would just put hot mac into the dish, top and put it under the broiler till toasty rather than cook it further. so \"baked\" I guess.",

        "body": "Your first problem is following a recipe from Mr. López-Alt. He's more interested in showing how smart he is and selling advertising than helping anyone. Among many other things he cheats and describes the cheat as \"elevating the dish.\" Mr. López-Alt is like the Kardashians - famous for being famous but not actually good for anything. \n\nSome notes and then a better recipe. \n\nTechnically, something splits are when an emulsion separates. Roux and bechamel are not emulsions. Interestingly (to me anyway) cheese is an emulsion of water and oil (and dairy fats) all by itself. If that splits you get a greasy liquid product. \n\nThe key to the roux > bechamel > Mornay progression is to stir and keep stirring and don't stop. Less heat than you think. See directions below. The sodium citrate thing (directly or with American \"cheese\" or Velveeta) is a cheat rather than adding the cheese a small handful at a time. See my recipe for cheeses and a warning about pre-shredded cheese. \n\nYou don't need to make your own bread crumbs. You can, and I often do, but there is nothing wrong with buying it in a tube, especially when you're starting out. \n\nI cook mine until it's bubbling around the edges. If the bread crumbs haven't browned I [hit it with a torch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVeUWfG7xhQ&t=150s) but you can use the broiler for a minute or two. Don't walk away. Watch it. It goes from not ready to burned in ten to twenty seconds. \n\nYou don't need extra cheese on top. The whole thing is cheese. You're asking for disappointment. \n\nGrown-up Mac & Cheese\n\n250g / 8 oz macaroni (elbow pasta is classic but I like cavatappi)  \n1 Tbsp (15g) unsalted butter (or 2 tsp oil)  \n2/3 cup panko breadcrumbs  \n2 Tbsp (30g) unsalted butter, melted  \n¼ tsp salt  \n100g / 3-4 oz of bacon  \n4 Tbsp (60g) unsalted butter  \n1 medium to large onion, finely diced  \n1/3 cup flour, plain / all purpose  \n3 cups milk, warmed (low or full fat, pasteurized or UHT, even nut milks work for the lactose intolerant)  \n2 cups freshly shredded cheese, Gruyere best (followed by cheddar and Colby) – you can use most cheeses with taste differences; I like a mix of Gruyere and cheddar  \n1 cup freshly shredded mozzarella cheese, or more other cheese of choice  \n¾ tsp salt  \n½ tsp pepper  \n½ tsp mustard powder (optional)  \n1 ripe tomato *very* thinly sliced  \n¾ cup bread crumbs\n\nCook pasta: Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook for one minute less than per package directions. Drain pasta and leave in colander until needed shortly. You can add butter if desired, just pats on top of the pasta in the colander, allowing residual heat to melt the butter.\n\nWhile the pasta is cooking, preheat oven to 180°C/350°F. Bake bacon. Cooked bacon lasts a long time in the fridge so I usually cook as much as I can fit on a quarter sheet pan and use about three strips of bacon (American “streaky” bacon) for the mac & cheese. Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and saute the onion. Add flour and stir. Keep stirring. Do not stop. If you don’t get all the lumps out now you never will. You have an onion-flavored roux. Add the dairy slowly in a spiral around the roux in the pan and stir. Keep stirring. Don’t stop. Cook until your now onion-flavored béchamel thickens, about five minutes. Turn off the heat and add the cheese a handful at a time and stir. Keep stirring. You now have a Mornay or cheese sauce. Do NOT use pre-shredded cheese. The preservatives and anti-clumping agents will result in a grainy product. Shred your own. With practice you can get the prep time for Mornay down to about ten minutes. It make take fifteen minutes the first time. Adjust salt to taste (if you use recommended cheeses, you won't need more).\n\nCrumble the bacon and add to the Mornay sauce and fold in the pasta. Pour everything into a casserole dish. Top with tomato slices and then with bread crumbs. Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden and bubbles begin to form around the edges.\n\nRestaurants make mac & cheese ahead, chill, and portion while cold before reheating. That’s usually not practical on a boat and certainly not at sea. You won’t have pretty rectangular servings. That’s life at sea.\n\n*Credit: Nagi at Recipetineats and me*",

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [€5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [€89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [€9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

They claim that the THD ascorbate is 50x more powerful than traditional vitamin c (I am skeptical and what are they referring to with “traditional vit c”).  Also has 3% vitamin E and 2% ferulic acid. The only negative I read in the reviews is people saying it was not ideal for dry skin types.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

It happened by accident. Bike racing is my thing. During the 2020 off season I started running regularly and concluded that completing a marathon was within my grasp. I’d previously dismissed the idea because long training runs in the British winter were not appealing. Seriously though, it’s important for me to enjoy the process of training.\n\nTo help me understand the basics of running training I bought Matt Fitzgerald’s 80/20 book. Throughout Nov-Feb I averaged around 30km each week. In March I increased avg distance to about 60km. The vast majority of runs were zone 2 easy runs.\n\nI entered the Paris marathon in April and decided to buy Matt Fitzgerald’s marathon training plan on Training Peaks. The plan started on 14 June and I followed it to the letter with few exceptions. It meant 5 days of 10-15km slow runs throughout the week with odd fartlek here or there, and a longer run on Sunday.\n\nThe longer runs were useful for determining 3 things: a) race nutrition b) race pacing c) race gear. My approach was to use the knowledge I’d gained on the bike, apply it to running, and iterate on it by effecting a series of experiments to answer any race day doubts/questions I had.\n\nMy bike fuelling strategy used to be inadequate. I would finish long rides feeling bad, with declining performance, and sometimes stomach cramps. Over the past year or two I learned I could finish rides without performance dropping off by ingesting sufficient carbs. Enough to account for 50% of my caloric burn worked great during my recent rides. I’m a fast twitcher, so I need carbs to keep me going.\n\nFuelling a run should be like fuelling a bike ride, right? No. On the morning of my long runs I would fill my water bottles with homemade carb mix (sugar water, sodium citrate, and freshly squeezed lemon for taste). My aim was to shoot for 100-120g of carbs per hour but I couldn’t tolerate it. It was too much water which left me feeling bloated. The lemon resulted in heart burn. And I couldn’t figure out the logistics of carrying all those carbs and water during the race.\n\nI decided to use 60g/hr of SiS gels and rely of water available at water stations. The gels are isotonic which meant that I didn’t need to rely on water to ensure the carbs emptied through my stomach. I practiced my intended strategy several times and it felt fine. No heart burn. No bloating. No GI issues. No perceivable performance decline during > 2hr runs.\n\nHow to pace the marathon didn’t become clear to me until after I had run a couple of half marathons. The first of which was in July where I managed a PB finish of under 1h30. The second was in September and I was able to further increase my pace to finish in 1h24. My conclusion was that I could run the first half of the marathon in 1h30 and then push for a slightly faster second half.\n\nFor the first half marathon I used HR to pace the run. Using Training Peaks I created a workout, uploaded it to my Forerunner so that it would tell me whether I was in the correct HR range. This worked fine but the Forerunner can be distracting when it beeps that your HR isn’t in the right range. It needed a STFU button.\n\nFor no specific reason, I ran the second half marathon to RPE whilst glancing at my pace every now and again. I would use this approach for the marathon. It’s simple, and not distracting.\n\nMy shoe rotation during training included Rincons; Cliftons; Speed Endorphins; Ultraboosts (these are like clogs); Ghosts. Again, I iterated until the solution became clear. The Sauconys were the most comfortable shoe, and the fastest. A week before the marathon I ran a few laps around the estate where I live to confirm that the Saunconys were indeed faster than the Rincons. They were by far.\n\nTowards the end of the plan my volume was between 80-100k per week. Long runs were 35k, or 2h-2h40. I never ran the full 42k. That felt like too much of an ordeal, the 2h40 runs were enough.\n\nIdeally I wouldn’t have picked up an annoying glute injury 4 weeks from the race. I avoided any speed work for fear for making the injury any worse than it was. To compensate I did a handful of VO2max workouts on the bike trainer.\n\nThe only significant deviation from the training plan was removing a 35k run 2 weeks from race day. I felt it would require too much recovery so I replaced it with a zone 2 19k. I did skip hill repeats that were in the plan. The halfs showed me that pace on the climbs wasn’t a limiter.\n\nLooking back I’m not sure I would do anything differently. I set a ton of PBs and ran further and faster than I ever have. My experiments answered all my questions to the extent I was confident on race day.\n\n## Pre-race\n\nThe travel schedule was as follows: Thursday — 2hr train from Leeds to London; Friday — 2hr train from London to Paris; Saturday — wander around Paris. Sunday — race day. Monday travel home.\n\nI know the importance of being well rested and well fuelled so for a bit more comfort  we paid more for the hotels than we normally would. This was definitely the right call.\n\nLooking back I would have booked a good restaurant for Saturday evening well in advance. We spent far too long on Saturday afternoon trying to find something. We’re vegan and Paris doesn’t make this easy for us. Everything is either beef, cheese, or beef and cheese. Our meal was nice but contained a bit too much fibre. This upset my stomach later in the evening and I had a few too many trips to the bathroom on Sunday morning. It wasn’t a problem during the race, but I could have done without the worry.\n\nWe arrived back at the hotel around 20h. That allowed sufficient time to wind down, check I hadn’t forgotten anything, prep my gear, and attach my race number. I was so fearful of forgetting to stick on my nipple protectors that I put them on the night before.\n\nBreakfast at the hotel was a €16 coffee and a slice of bread and jam. I paid for the convenience, no regrets. I never have anything heavier than that if I know I’m going to be running.\n\nMy start time was 9h25. We left the hotel at 8h15 and made the 10min walk to the Champs-Elysées. It was a beautiful but cold Paris morning. 5º. I wore my down-filled puffer jacket that I would later hand over to my wife 5 mins before start.\n\nLooking back, I’m not sure I would have changed anything except for the restaurant on Saturday night. I would have preferred a big bowl of pasta.\n\n## Race\n\nThe race was uneventful. I did almost everything I wanted to do.\n\nGear was: Lulu Fast and Free Run Hat; Lulu Fast and Free tank; Lulu Surge 4” Shorts with liner; Saucony Endorphin Speed 2. I like the Lululemon gear. It’s high quality, and performs great. I don’t need to worry about labels that scratch or bad fit.\n\n60g/hr of carbs. 9 gels. Eat one 15mins before race start. 4 in my back pocket, 2 in my phone pocket, and 2 in my hands. One thing that I omitted to practice was carrying the gels in the pockets and quickly discovered the 4 in the back pocket was too heavy. They were bouncing around too much. It was annoying. The solution was to take two our and carry two gels in each hand instead of one in each hand.\n\nI’ve been in enough races that pre-race nerves no longer affect me. Experience helps. That doesn’t mean I’m not excited to get going. I just enjoy the music coming from the PA, put on a happy face, and look forward to racing.\n\nThe early pace was comfortable, and my watch told me it was around 4:10-4:15/km. I was thinking great! I’ve not set off too quickly and a 90min half is achievable.\n\nI didn’t once look at HR. I would calibrate RPE vs pace and then maintain RPE. I would say the first hour felt like 4-5.\n\nI did have a lot of overtaking to do. I started in the 3h15 group and I was now aiming for 3hrs. There were several large groups following the 3h15 pace makers. I enjoyed leaving them behind.\n\nThe atmosphere along the course was amazing. Lots of music. People cheering. Kids holding their hands out for high fives.\n\nI might have run a bit longer that I would have wanted before having my first gel but the first water station was nearer 25mins of running. From that point I’d gulp down a gel and wash it down with a mouthful of water.\n\nPhysically and mentally I started hurting at around the 38k mark. RPE was probably up to 7 by that time. I noticed that my pace had a tendency to drop, so I had to pay more attention to my watch to keep the pace up.\n\nFor much of the race my Garmin was in the predicted finish time screen. Most of the time it would read 2h59. I thought I had one whole minute in the bag. That wasn’t quite the case. What I didn’t realise until too late was that the Garmin was announcing the kilometres about one or two hundred metres before reaching the kilometre marker signs. This would mean I would complete the marathon distance on the Garmin 100-200m ahead of the finish line. I would have 30-60s left to run. Crap.\n\nMy hamstrings were hurting. Left calf felt like it could cramp at any moment. I was scared of increasing pace too much that the cramp would cripple my race.\n\n2k from the finish, I was just hanging on for dear life. My body was begging me to stop. My brain was checking out. RPE was 8-9. I still had a minute in the bank at this point but I wasn’t sure if it was enough. I gave everything I had over the final 2k.\n\nCrossed the finish line. Stopped the Garmin. It read 3h00m15s. Official finish time was 3h00m9s. I’m not going to forget about those 9s any time soon but instead I’ll use them to motivate me during my marathon training next year.\n\n## Post-race\n\nI don’t think I got much wrong. I got a heck of lot right: pacing; training; gear; choice of first marathon. My km splits were consistent across the race. Even the final two kilometres weren’t that disastrous, being only 10s/km slower than average. I ran an even split, the second half was only 6s slower than the first.\n\nI think I was becoming glycogen depleted towards the end. I might aim for 70g/hr carbs next time. A caffeine gel would have been good near the end too.\n\nI could barely walk back to the hotel after the marathon but my legs started feeling normal on Tuesday.\n\nIn hindsight I should have started in the 3h group, but I couldn’t know I was capable of that pace when I entered the marathon.\n\nThe summer training was enjoyable so I’m now looking to enter another autumn marathon next year. Maybe Berlin or Boston.",

I had initially planned to write this review 2 weeks after using the latter, but I’ve had a below average experience in one week itself so I’d like to share my review in hopes of being of help to those who want to purchase it.\n\n*I have dry skin not prone to acne, have very little to no pigmentation and use Vitamin C as a preventive measure against ageing, sun damage and dullness. I live in an area with high UV levels and a very humid climate.*\n\n*My routine: Episoft Cleansing Lotion, Laneige Cream Skin Refiner: Toner & Moisturiser, Minimalist's Vitamin C Serum, Bello Photostable Emulgel SPF 40 (day) and Moskina Cream (night).*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Texture Shot](https://preview.redd.it/35qouoy87q871.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9053ecf1c188f97b487b54a5a2b714b59a0a04cd)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\nChemist At Play:\n\n>Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic acid, Propan-di-ol, Sodium Isomerate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Ferulic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Oryza Sativa (Rice Phytoceramide), Amorphophallus (Konjac Phytoceramide), Hamamelis Virginiana, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Polysorbate 80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMinimalist:\n\n>Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Ethoxydiglycol, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Glycerin, Sodium Gluconate, Acetyl Glucosamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Pullulan, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lecithin, Lactic Acid\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison](https://preview.redd.it/q0l52oub7q871.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=452589ce63e896b49a2bb5a08fbc6956ad6b9cf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChemist At Play has Witch Hazel and Citric Acid; this may not be problematic for all, but if they are for you then keep this serum away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, Minimalist gave me the actual results a Vitamin C serum is supposed to give but Chemist At Play did the reverse. I'm just glad that it didn't give me any CC's or acne. I'm going to go ahead and reverse the dullness through Minimalist's serum. I'm better off using a ceramide infused moisturiser after my serum than have it in my serum in this case, which is a pity because if this serum had worked for me, it would've been an all-rounder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, everyone's skin is different and this is just one, hopefully helpful review.",

It wasn't too much, maybe 1.5 tablespoons for a 1/4 cup of butter. When I realized what did I thought \"whats the worst that could happen?\" and continued with the rest of flour, cooked it until nutty deliciousness then carried on as I normally would. The happy accident is that in the end was the silkiest, thickest, and smoothest cheese sauce I have ever made - including both beer and non-beer cheese sauce as well as the times I've experimented with evaporated milk versions etc. etc. I have professional culinary experience and have made cheese sauce more times than I can count but this was in a league of it's own. I did NOT use sodium citrate or any of that nonsense, just a basic roux based sauce nothing fancy, no bells or whistles.\n\nCould the extra accidental cornstarch really have affected the texture to this degree? If so, what is the science behind this? Has anyone else done this accidentally or on purpose and what were their results? Or, have people been mixing cornstarch and flour into roux for cheese sauce and I'm just the dolt who's been missing out!? Any and all feedback is appreciated! Thanks!",

Flour is made of protein and starch, with cake and pastry flour containing less protein and all-purpose and bread flour containing more.  Pure starch lends itself to a glossier, smoother-feeling sauce.\n\nThe same sort of dynamic you're noticing can be seen in pastry cream, which is an egg and dairy emulsion.  Old-school recipes contain all or mainly flour, while more modern recipes use both flour and cornstarch or all cornstarch.  The flour-heavy versions tend to be stiffer and are useful when you want some structure in your pastry cream, while the cornstarch-dominant versions tend to be glossier and silkier in texture.\n\nAs an aside, sodium citrate isn't nonsense.  It's useful when you want to use liquids other than milk in your cheese sauce, and especially when you want to use cheeses that don't melt well without breaking like sharp cheddars, fetas, and blues.",

It has a habit of breaking if it gets too hot, or if there is too much of the brown butter and bacon grease and not enough sour cream. It's a recipe that's never really been written down and I was wondering if anyone had an idea of an emulsifier or stabilizer that would make it so the sauce didn't break but I wouldn't have to worry too much about ratios on any of the ingredients. I was thinking sodium citrate but I haven't tried it yet. I have access to quite a few \"modernist\" thickeners/emulsifiers, but nothing too niche. And of course all pantry staples.",

You can actually also mix in the dmg in hot bacon fat as it needs to melt. Taste is very neutral. Something like lecithin will have a strong taste (I don’t like it). \n\nSucrose esters will also work.

There are kits for molecular gastronomy that have such ingredients. \n\nCitrate might not work well here, as it will work on the caseinates in the cream only.",

Here is the recipe (formula) that makes 11 grams, mix 8 (7.96) grams of citric acid and 9.5 (9.48) grams of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) then add to your liquid. It will foam and after the foam subsides the liquid will contain about 11 grams of SC. If you want to make SC and save it here are the ratios, for every 2.1 grams of citric acid, use 2.5 grams of sodium bicarbonate in a little water, this ratio will yield about 2.9 grams of SC. Then on medium heat evaporate off the water and the remaining powder left in the pan is sodium citrate.

However an English product commonly found in Aus, NZ, UK and India is an old-fashioned (early 20th Century) indigestion remedy called \"Eno\" - it's a powder you mix into water and drink, and it happens to be an almost identical product to Alka-Seltzer Gold, containing sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and citric acid in roughly the same proportions - and no aspirin!\n\nSo having bought a bottle of Eno (regular, not lemon flavoured), I set about testing the recipe using this product instead....\n\nLong story short, it works beautifully! Made a lovely little bowl of gooey cheese sauce in about 3 mins on the stovetop, no hassle at all. \nMy sauce used margarine in place of butter as I had none around, and tasty cheddar cheese from Aldi, and is delicious! I would not season further with salt, there is a little salty buzz in it already, I assume from the reaction that creates the sodium citrate, but YMMV.\n\nSimply follow the recipe as SE directs, except use 2 teaspoons of Eno powder instead of the Alka-Seltzer tablets, and boom, amazing cheese sauce haha.\n\nMy previous go-to for a cheese sauce that isn't bechamel-based was Kenji's 3-ingredient cheese sauce, and I would say this is a better sauce, and doesn't leave me with half a tin of evaporated milk that sits in the back of the fridge and slowly grows mold!

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**💸Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**🍶Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**💸 PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**💸Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it’s pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin. So I started mixing it with my moisturiser and things were good !\n\nBefore this I have only used Sugandha vit C which I also liked and Minimalist 10% vit C which did nothing for my skin.",

The “Glycerol” product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good “lots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide” product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it’s mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, “sweet scented geranium”(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn’t sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to “not have pH” (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn’t buy the Pixi version as it’s still £17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

Problem is, there's not much stabilizing it. At room temp, it softens quite a bit. At normal cooking temperatures, the emulsion breaks rather quickly.\n\nBut not American cheese. It's super melty and luscious, and never seems to break, and that's because it *does* have an added stabilizer: sodium citrate.\n\nNow, lots of recipes for cheese sauces call for you to stir in American cheese first, and then slowly add in others. The reason being, it's a quick and available way to get sodium citrate into the sauce. This powerful emulsifier will allow you to incorporate your other (probably more desirable) cheeses without fear they'll break and ruin the whole sauce.\n\nThat bag of sodium citrate you've got will allow you to make all the cheese sauce, fondue, and queso dip you want, while cutting out American cheese as a middleman.\n\nJust google \"cheese sauce recipe sodium citrate\" to get started. You'll find plenty of ideas that way.\n\nBest of luck!",

I've never tried it and i've never even seen sodium citrate anywhere (do they sell it in a supermarket or something?)\n\nLiquid smoke, meanwhile, is literally wood smoke that is vacuumed into some apparatus that condenses it into a liquid and filters out all of the harmful parts of smoke leaving only the parts that give food its smoked flavour (and iirc it even has some positive effects for food storage and conservation). I don't know how exactly to use it since, again, never seen it, but maybe you add it in when searing meat on a pan or when braising in a slow cooker like your friend said to create smoke and flavour the meat with it?

    "body": "As many of you know, the Kirkland Signature formula was recently discontinued. the \"ProCare\" version is now replacing it, so I decided to do a comparison between the new, the old, and Similac Pro-Advance (which has been the Kirkland replacement temporarily).\n\n[Kirkland Signature Infant Formula on left, Similac Pro-Advance on the right](https://i.imgur.com/V6L0GEr.jpg)\n\n[Kirkland Signature ProCare Infant Formula](https://i.imgur.com/wLFWoGh.jpg)\n\nUsing the previous Kirkland formula as the \"standard\", here are the differences I found:\n\n**Kirkland Signature Infant Formula vs Similac Pro-Advance**:\n\n* INOSITOL: 4.9 mg -> 24 mg.\n* IODINE 6 mcg -> 15 mcg.\n* Adds potassium iodide. All other ingredients and ingredient order the same.\n\n**Kirkland Signature Infant Formula vs Kirkland Signature ProCare Infant Formula**:\n\n* Powder is more dense. 1 scoop = 8.8 g, versus 8.2 g of the previous formula.\n* Makes 5 fl oz. prepared vs 5.3 fl oz prepared of the previous formula (same reason as above).\n* CARBOHYDRATES: 10.5 g -> 10.7 g.\n* WATER: 141 g -> 133 g (probably the reason for the higher density).\n* INOSITOL: 4.9 mg -> 24 mg.\n* IODINE 6 mcg -> 15 mcg.\n* HIGH OLEIC SAFFLOWER OIL appears before WHEY PROTEIN CONCENTRATE on the ingredients list. Perhaps if they found a better way to dehydrate the whey concentrate, the differences above could explain this since the ingredients are listed in order of percentage weight.\n* FRUCTOOLIGOSACCHARAIDE (FOS) moved higher up (by three spots) on the ingredients list.\n* LYCOPENE removed.\n* POTASSIUM CITRATE -> POTASSIUM BICARBONATE.\n* Added MONOGLYCERIDES.\n* CALCIUM CARBONATE -> CALCIUM CHLORIDE, CALCIUM HYDROXIDE.\n* SALT -> SODIUM CITRATE.\n* THIAMINE CHLORIDE HYDROCHLORIDE -> THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE.\n* SODIUM SELENATE -> SODIUM SELENITE.\n* Removed CALCIUM PHOSPHATE.\n* Added POTASSIUM IODIDE.\n\nI was mostly interested in the increased FOS. There have been some studies on its [effect on calcium uptake on adolescents](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/69/3/544/4694202) and [infant gut flora](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23498848), both of them showing favorable results.\n\nIn all, digging through the ingredients and nutrition facts on these three different formulas didn't seem to yield many differences. That shouldn't be a big surprise, since baby formulas are regulated to some extent. It seems like the biggest change in the ProCare is they just reduced the water content, so it's a bit more space efficient.",

Then I went to the store and was pretty upset they had no formula. I found out via the internet it had been discontinued so I really wanted to know the ingredient difference in the old vs. new formula and this helped tremendously. I think I read something else on here the other day that said it's no longer private label Similac and it's the usual generic version carried by most other stores, hence the small differences.",

I think unfortunately I'll need to now pony up for Similac unless I can find another white label Similac elsewhere.",

I actually called to ask about the change and their response was yes they modified it slightly to increase the caloric density to better match breastmilk. I’m betting the new Kirkland formula matches the new Similac pro advance formula.",

I melted 4 cups of *PRESHREDDED* cheese into this recipe using Kenji's cornstarch method (https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-use-cornstarch-and-evaporated-milk-to-make-stable-emulsion-cheese-sauce). I simply added cornstarch to my bag of cheese, tossed it around, and I got melty magic.\n\nI totally bastardized Kenji's chili recipe (https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chili-recipe) using what I had around: ground beef instead of short ribs, carrots added for sweetness, tomato paste instead of crushed tomatoes, worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, red wine instead of vodka, chilis I had around versus what the recipe calls for... Honestly, a lot of substitutions, but I think Kenji would approve. I'm currently enjoying the subtle flavors as I type this out.\n\n\nLike I said, the point of this post is really to thank Kenji for his awesome cornstarch method of melting preshredded cheese. I know this sub is also a fan of his other methods (sodium citrate), but I was sleeping on this simple technique. ",

Although, there likely won’t be a next time…\n\nMIL was watching our dog and gave him Benadryl without asking us first because he was itchy. I did some googling and it looks like he’s probably gonna be ok. I just wanted to ask here to see what y’all think. I think she gave him 10mg. He weighs about 14 pounds. He’s also on Prozac but still needs to take his dose today. Would it be ok for me to give it to him?\n\n2nd edit: y’all I got a hold of the ingredients. It’s the CVS Health, Adult's Maximum Strength Allergy Relief, Diphenhydramine Liquid, Grape.
