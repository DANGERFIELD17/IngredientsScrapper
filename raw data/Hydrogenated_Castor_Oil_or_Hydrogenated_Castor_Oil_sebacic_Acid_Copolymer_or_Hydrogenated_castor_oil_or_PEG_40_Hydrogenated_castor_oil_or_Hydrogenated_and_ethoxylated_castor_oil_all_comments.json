    "body": "Description on website:\n‚ÄúLip balm that imparts a subtle fragrance at the tip of your nose. It provides immediate nourishment with rich plant-based oils, keeping dry lips moist and soft. The scent, made with safe ingredients, is packaged in a handy case resembling the smooth curves and texture of an egg, giving you a pleasant feeling anytime, anywhere.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.tamburins.com/en/item/1695801896/\n\n\nI love eggs so the adorable container is instantly appealing, i love drinking milk tea and it smells like one, i could always use more lip balms, so i decided to get one when i saw it at ICN.\n\n \nBought for USD19 duty-free at ICN airport.\n\n\nMy lips are okay, doesnt get dry or crack often that i need lip balm everyday but they‚Äôre nice to layer under my lip colour or gloss.\n\n\nPackaging & Application:\n * Egg-shaped tube, twist up for more product. Comes in a sturdy, fancy box. Great for gifting.\n\n\n * Material & Design:\nEgg container is most likely made out of some plastic material but textured to resemble real eggshell. Imagine the softest sandpaper. No info on website.\n\n\n * Ease of Use:\nOpen cap, apply directly. Twist up the egg for more product.\n\n\n * Portability: It‚Äôs a flat little egg and fits in \n the slimmest bags, very handy.\n\n\n * Durability: Sturdy, quality packaging. Use some caution when taking cap off and putting back on. Certain angles may cause the cap to come in contact with the balm. I accidentally scooped a tiny bit of it just now with the cap.\n\n\nIngredients & Formulation:\n * Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Dimer Dilinoleate, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Propylheptyl Caprylate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Butylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Seed Oil, Phytosteryl/Behenyl/Octyldodecyl Lauroyl Glutamate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Synthetic Wax, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Fragrance(Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Lecithin, Geraniol, Limonene, Tocopherol\n\n\nManufactured by Cosmax Co. Ltd.\n\n\n * feels oily, smooth and thin upon application- elegant formulation.\n\n\nScent & Flavor:\n\nTop: bergamot, lemon \nMiddle: black tea \nBase: coconut\n\nWebsite:  ‚Äúbased on black tea with a subtle flower smell, this scent brings you the soft scent on the tip of your nose when you drink a glass of black tea with a drop of warm milk, and the warmth gives you the comfort you feel when you take a full rest. Fresh and refreshing bergamot and lemon blend with the bittersweet feeling of black tea, adding layers for daily use. The coconut note adds a soft and sweet finish to the lingering fragrance.‚Äù\n\n\nMy thoughts:\n * subtle, pleasant fragrance of milk tea as if you just had a sip.\n * milk tea scent fades away after a while and does mot linger, good if sensitive to smell but still enjoys some fragrance.\n * unscented/unflavored version also available.\n\n\nPerformance & Effectiveness:\n * Immediate Hydration: when used in comparison with my current lip balm from hersteller and lip oil from Sampar addict, this balm is definitely more moisturizing.\n\n\n * Long-Term Hydration: one application lasts 3-4 hours without drinking/eating.\n\n\n * Healing Properties: pretty much immediate relief for chapped lips soon after application.\n\n\n * Protection: tested in a dry, airplane cabin for 7 hours. Held up well and lips remain moisturised upon disembarking.\n\n\n * Overall Comfort: feels pleasantly creamy on the lips and milk tea scent fades over time.\n\n\nLongevity & Value for Money:\n * i dont use lip balms often/everyday, only as needed.\n * Considering the price of USD19 for 5g of product, i dont think this is cost-effective.\n\n\nWho Would This Be Good For?\nGood for you if you find eggs cute, enjoys drinking milk tea,  need a quick relief for chapped lips and most importantly have USD19 laying around for fun money.\n\n\nWould You Repurchase?\n * No WNRP but only because i already bought it once and have the container now. I plan to refill it myself with a cheaper alternative. Would not pay USD19 for another lip balm.\n\n\nOverall Rating:\n * 4 out of 5, would WRP if it was USD9 and not USD19.\n\n\nTL;DR cute lil egg lip balm that smells of delicious milk tea, instant relief for chapped lips but quite pricey at USD19 for 5grams. Fun gift and souvenir.",

    "body": "*Edits: Removed Azelaic Acid since it is not a hydroxy acid and it created confusion*\n\nOriginally, this whole post was going to be about exfoliation, but I swear, there's just too much ground to try to cover in one post. As usual, my goals with these posts is not to necessarily make product recommendations for specific skin types, but to talk about the ingredients themselves. For this post however, I worked in products since hydroxy acid products are still a question mark to a lot of skin newbies. I say, \"You should try something with AHA!\" and I get asked, \"Wait, what is that? Is that a brand or is it on the bottle or...?\"As such, I've put products in each category (though mandelic is sparse...) and noted some as my personal recommendations based on the ingredients or my own anecdotal evidence of efficacy (for example, I use the 2% BHA Liquid and think it is VERY effective and has a pretty clean ingredient list).\n\nOne of these days I'll get around to doing a general, broad recommendations post, but today is not that day. \n\nAs usual, please feel free to correct me, update me, or make recommendations for your specific regions in the comments. The sunscreen post had a TON of discussion like this and I thought it was wonderful that these threads have not just been a place for me to braindump, but a place for us all to learn about specific things together. **So thank you.** \n\nOne more note: I wrote this on a night I was *really* struggling to write, so please feel free to call out weird clarity issues.\n\n---\n\nWhen I was younger, I spent almost every waking moment browsing skincare communities. Most posts in those communities boils down to routine help, selfies, or general questions, but sometimes, skincare routines in popular media come up. One such routine was displayed in the film American Psycho with Christian Bale. You can do a quick Google search and find numerous articles, blog posts, and videos about Patrick Bateman's infamous daily routine and people who've tried to follow it.\n\nIn the film, Patrick Bateman -- a man with deep, anti-social behaviors -- details his morning routine:\n\n>‚ÄúI live in the American Gardens Building on W. 81st Street on the 11th floor. My name is Patrick Bateman. I‚Äôm 27 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine.\n\n>\"In the morning if my face is a little puffy I‚Äôll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now.\n\n>\"After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.‚Äù\n\nShowing the audience this routine reveals to us how much emphasis Bateman puts on his outwards appearance -- a central theme to the film.\n\nMost people care deeply about their appearance, whether they're following a Bateman-esc routine or trimming their brows. After all, glowing skin is typically a sign of health.\n\nBateman's routine puts particular emphasis on a youthful appearance, with multiple scrubs, peels, and moisturizers; and indeed it is exfoliation and skin-cell turnover that keeps your skin looking younger and healthier, but how do we get there from here? What should a good exfoliation routine look like? Where do you even start?\n\nIn this post, I'll be breaking down some of the things that can keep us looking younger: AHAs, BHAs, and LHAs.\n\n#**Introduction to Hydroxy Acids**\n\nYou may remember from my post on moisturizers that skin cells (keratinocytes) begin deep in the stratum basale -- the deepest layer of the epidermis -- and work their way upwards, flattening out, hardening, dying, and eventually flaking away.\n\nHowever, some skin cells are not quite as good at this as others. They will build up, stick together, or get \"stuck\" in the pores (hair and oil gland openings) of skin. Hydroxy acids are what is called an \"active\" skincare ingredient -- basically something that performs an action on the skin. In this case, rejuvenation and exfoliation. They are largely found in botanical sources, which is why they are frequently referred to as fruit acids, and are divided up based upon the hydroxyl groups on their molecular structures. Hydroxy acids posses the ability to separate skin cells from the stratum corneum, which can be hugely beneficial to skin diseases that are characterized by a build up of dead skin (or hyperkeratosis), such as acne. Many also have the ability to stimulate the growth of collagen in the deeper layers of the skin, resulting in the reduction of fine lines over time.[1][2][3][4][7]\n\nIf you want to think of it in a more simple way, hydroxy acids are solutions that break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together (not the skin cells themselves), but like with anything that performs an action on the skin, this can be very irritating. Whether or not it is irritating to you depends on your needs and the formulations as well as the concentrations of the exfoliants you pick.\n\n#**AHAs**\n\nThe term AHA is short for \"Alpha Hydroxy Acid.\" It is the most common of the chemical exfoliants you can find. They're usually associated with creating glowing, youthful skin due to their ability to exfoliate away the upper layers of the stratum corneum so effectively.\n\nThey work best around a pH of 3.5, which allows for better absorption. The higher the pH, the lower the amount of acid that is absorbed by the skin. To demonstrate this, one study compared the effects of glycolic and lactic acid on the skin when applied at different pH values. At a pH of 3, the total absorption of a 5% glycolic acid cream in 24 hours was 27%. When increasing the pH value to 7, that absorption tanked to a mere 3.5%. Similarly, 5% lactic acid had a total absorption of 30% over 24 hours at a pH of 3, which dropped to 10% when the pH was boosted to a value of 7. [5]\n\nThey are water-soluble, meaning that they work best directly on clean, dry skin. Some even have humectant properties, allowing them to draw moisture into the upper layers of the skin.\n\nAll AHAs create photo-sensitization -- or sensitivity to the sun -- due to their ability to exfoliate the stratum corneum.\n\nAHAs are also generally not recommended for rosacean or eczema-prone skin, as they can worsen the inflammation that is common in these conditions. Additionally, avoid using AHAs in combination with other forms of exfoliation (such as physical scrubbing) or prescription topicals given to you by your dermatologist, especially tretinoin/Retin-A.\n\nThere are multiple types of AHAs, and they come in various forms, differentiated by molecular size and source. The most common types of AHAs are glycolic, mandelic, and lactic.\n\n#**Glycolic**\n\nThe most common form of AHA is glycolic, and it's found in nearly every AHA product you can find these days. It has a small molecular structure, meaning it can penetrate the upper layers of the skin more easily and quickly, but it is also the most irritating due to these properties. It's usually found in products in concentrations of 8-10%. Some examples of popular products with glycolic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 8% AHA Gel - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Glycolic Acid (alpha hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Flower Extract (chamomile/skin-soothing), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (hydration), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/antioxidant/skin-soothing), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin replenishing), Panthenol (hydration), Sodium PCA (skin replenishing), Propylene Glycol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Hydroxyethylcellulose (texture-enhancing), Polyquaternium-10 (texture-enhancing), Phenoxyethanol (preservative), Sodium Benzoate (preservative).\n\n**Pixi Glow Tonic**\n\n>Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Glycolic Acid, Ammonium Glycolate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Hexylene Glycol (and) Fructose (and) Glucose (and) Sucrose (and) Urea (and) Dextrin (and) Alanine (and) Glutamic Acid (and) Aspartic Acid (and) Hexyl Nicotinate, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Biotin, Polysorbate 20.\n\n**Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Daily Cleansing Pads**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Water, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Alcohol Denat. (SD Alcohol 40-B), Disodium EDTA, Globularia Alypum (Blue Daisy) Extract, Panthenol, Lactic Acid, Parfum, Limonene, Ethylhexylglycerin, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Linalool, Geraniol, Citral.\n\n\n**CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid**\n\n>Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycolic Acid, Niacinamide, Sodium Hydroxide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol.\n\n#**Lactic Acid**\n\nLactic acid is the second most common of all AHAs, and can be frequently found hanging out in the ingredients with other AHAs or BHAs , though it is a fine exfoliator on its own. It has a larger molecule than glycolic, making it slower to act and less irritating -- ideal for more sensitive skin. It is usually derived from milk, and has the best humectant properties out of all of the acids. Some examples of popular products with lactic acid:\n\n**Sunday Riley Good Genes All-In-One Lactic Acid Treatment**\n\n>Opuntia Tuna Fruit (Prickly Pear) Extract, Agave Tequilana Leaf (Blue Agave) Extract, Cypripedium Pubescens (Lady's Slipper Orchid) Extract, Opuntia Vulgaris (Cactus) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract & Saccharomyses Cerevisiae (Yeast) Extract, Lactic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Cyclomethicone, Dimethicone, Ppg-12/Smdi Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol And Ceteareth20, Glyceryl Stearate And Peg-100 Stearate, Arnica Montana (Flower) Extract, Peg-75 Meadowfoam Oil, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus (Lemongrass) Oil, Triethanolamine, Xantham Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Steareth-20, Dmdm Hydantoin.\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% + HA**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Arginine, Potassium Citrate, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethyl 2,2-Dimethylhydrocinnamal, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol.\n\n**AmLactin 12% Alpha-Hydroxy Therapy Daily Moisturizing Body Lotion - Recommended (for body)**\n\n>Water, Lactic Acid, Light Mineral Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Laureth 4, Polyoxyl 40 Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Methylcellulose.\n\n**Mandelic Acid**\n\nMandelic acid has only just begun to appear on the scene, though it has been around for awhile. It is one of the best choices for very sensitive skin, and great for acne-prone skin due to its anti-bacterial and anti-microbial nature. It is derived from almonds and has moderate humectant properties, floating somewhere between glycolic and lactic. An example of a popular product with mandelic acid:\n\n**Stratia Skin Soft Touch AHA with 10% Mandelic Acid - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Mandelic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.\n\nThere are also plenty of products that combine several alpha hydroxy acids together, such as:\n\n**Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos Glycolic Night Serum**\n\n>Water, Glycolic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Sodium Hydroxide, Salicylic Acid, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Juice Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Extract, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Buddleja Davidii Meristem Cell Culture, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Allantoin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Galactoarabinan, Propanediol, Disodium EDTA, Xanthan Gum, Hexylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Sorbate, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate.\n\n**Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Salicylic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Lactic Acid, Mandelic Acid, Malic Acid, Citric Acid, Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract, Menthyl Lactate, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Soy Isoflavones, Copper PCA, Zinc PCA, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Benzoate.\n\n#**BHAs**\n\nBHA is short for \"Beta Hydroxy Acid.\" These acids are slightly more complex than AHAs due to their oil-solubility. They are able to penetrate not just the skin, like AHAs, but also the pores of the skin. This is what makes them an ideal choice for acne-prones, who tend to have lipid-rich sebaceous glands.\n\nBHAs work best around pH values of 3, and in concentrations of 1-2%. They're frequently found with AHAs, but can be found in formulations without the addition of other hydroxy acids.\n\nBHAs are not as photo-sensitizing as AHAs [6], but it is still frequently recommended that you wear a sunscreen when using any hydroxy acid.\n\nThere are two major types of BHAs: salicylic acid and lipohydroxy acid.\n\n#**Salicylic Acid**\n\nWhen discussing BHAs, the ingredient that is usually being discussed is salicylic acid, which is derived from salicin -- the same stuff in asprin. Due to this origin, salicylic acid should be avoided if you have an asprin allergy.\n\nSalicylic acid has no humectant properties, and can cause drying of the skin. Though if formulated correctly, this can largely be avoided which can make BHA a much more effective acne treatment for some than harsher, more drying topicals such as benzoyl peroxide.\n\nIt can also be soothing to some skin types, such as rosacean skin or acne skin, and is pretty well-tolerated overall.\n\nSome examples of popular products with salicylic acid:\n\n**Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid  - Recommended**\n\n>Water (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n**Stridex Triple Action Pads, Alcohol Free (Red Box)**\n\n>Salicylic acid 2.0%, Ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium xylenesulfonate, citric acid, DMDM hydantoin, fragrance, menthol, PPG-5-Ceteth-20, purified water, simethicone, sodium borate, tetrasodium EDTA.\n\n#**Lipohydroxy Acid**\n\nLipohydroxy acid is a derivative of salicylic acid, with unique properties. It has a higher molecular weight and an added fatty chain, making it more lipophilic (oil loving) than its parent SA.\n\nFirst developed by L'Oreal in the 1980s, it penetrates the skin less easily due to it's lipophilic properties. This slower penetration means that it breaks down the glue of the skin cells slower, but it is still unclear whether or not this results in less irritation.\n\nLike other hydroxy acids, LHA thins the stratum corneum, but has dermal thickening properties. In one study, it was shown to be as effective as tretinoin, due to it's stimulation of structural skin proteins and lipids. [7]\n\nIt is excellent for acne skin due to it's lipophilic nature, and in one study, showed a decrease of 85% in follicular plugs over 14 days. [8]\n\nIt is only available in products made by L'Oreal, so it is difficult to get your hands on a wide variety. Some examples:\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Cleansing Gel**\n\n>aqua / water / eau, coco-betaine, propylene glycol, peg-120 methyl glucose dioleate, sorbitol, glycerin, glycolic acid, triethanolamine, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium chloride, disteareth-100 ipdi, phenoxyethanol, salicylic acid, capryloyl salicylic acid, menthol, methylparaben, disodium edta, steareth-100.\n\n**La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo**\n\n>Water, Isostearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Silica, Carbomer, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Epilobium Angustioflium Flower/leaf/stem Extract.\n\n**SkinCeuticals LHA Toner**\n\n>Water / Eau, Alcohol Denat., Glycolic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Salicylic Acid.\n\n\n\n#**All Together Now**\n\n* **If you're sensitive, avoid AHA and BHA used together.** Multiple hydroxy acids in one product increase your likelihood of a reaction. It's better to start low and slow when introducing skin to a hydroxy acid.\n*  **Lower concentrations for beginners.** If you've never used a hydroxy acid, go for lower concentrations, such as 1% BHA (Paula's Choice makes a 1% variety of BHA) and 4-5% glycolic acid. If your skin is sensitive and generally reactive, look for larger molecules, like lactic or mandelic acid.\nIf you're oily-skinned, rosacean, or acne-prone, try BHA. I cannot understate enough how great BHA is. It is generally soothing and can break through oils on the skin, making it ideal for acne.\n* **Do not use physical exfoliation like scrubs, towels, or a Clarisonic when using a chemical exfoliant.** Your stratum corneum thins when using a chemical exfoliant, so you shouldn't need to be physically scrubbing your skin, which can just create irritation.\n* **Be careful when using BP/retinol/retinoids with AHAs/BHAs if you are very sensitive.** If you're very sensitive with conditions such as rosacea or eczema, be cautious when using other actives in addition to AHAs/BHAs. This can be too much for some skin.  \n* **Use hydroxy acids infrequently.** Unlike Patrick Bateman, most people do not need daily exfoliation. Use a hydroxy acid two to three times a week. Tweak this based on how your skin reacts.\n* **Back off if you're breaking out.** Skin irritation can occur with hydroxy acids, usually in the form of breakouts. If this occurs, discontinue use until your skin clears. Re-introduce the product slowly and use fewer days per week. If the reaction re-occurs, discontinue use entirely.\n* **Use a sunscreen during the day.** Except for salicylic acid, hydroxy acids thin the stratum corneum and photo-sensitize the skin. You must use a sunscreen during the day to prevent damage and sunburn.\n* **Use at night.** As I said above, hydroxy acids photo-sensitize you (except BHA). Use them at night for this reason.\n* **Use hydroxy acids as close to the skin as possible.** Applying any skin \"active\" right after you cleanse is ideal. This ensures it is as close to the skin as possible, and does not need to penetrate any additional products to work.\n\n---\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [Effects of alpha-hydroxy acids on photoaged skin: a pilot clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural study.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)\n* [A review of skin ageing and its medical therapy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Epidermal and dermal effects of topical lactic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)\n* [Glycolic Acid Treatment Increases Type I Collagen mRNA and Hyaluronic Acid Content of Human Skin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x?amp;userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=)\n* [Labmuffin - Why does pH matter for AHAs and BHAs](https://labmuffin.com/fact-check-friday-why-does-ph-matter-for-ahas-and-bhas/)\n* The effects of topically applied glycolic acid and salicylic acid on ultraviolet radiation-induced erythema, DNA damage and sunburn cell formation in human skin: https://www.jdsjournal.com/article/S0923-1811(09)00099-1/abstract\n* [The Use of Lipohydroxy Acid in Skin Care and Acne Treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300717/)\n* [Comedolysis by a lipohydroxyacid formulation in acne-prone subjects.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12609785)\n\n---\n\n* * *\nAll of My Posts\n=======\n\n* [Purging, Irritation, and Gram-Negative Folliculitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/90dq0d/misc_acne_prolonged_purging_irritation_and/)\n* [Dehydrated Skin: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wxwuv/misc_dehydrated_skin_an_updated_guide_to_healing/)\n* [A Guide to Your Dermatologist: When to go, picking a doctor, prepping for your first visit, and tackling shame and depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8wfpvs/misc_a_guide_to_your_dermatologist_when_to_go_to/)\n* [Perioral Dermatitis](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8teeln/misc_perioral_dermatitis_an_odd_mouth_rash/)\n* [Keratosis Pilaris: An Updated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8smxjr/misc_keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition/)\n* [Rosacea](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8omjau/research_rosacea_the_curse_of_the_celts/)\n* [Rosacea: Recommended Products](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8qdha9/misc_rosacea_recommended_products/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Hydroxy Acids](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Sunscreen](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Moisturizers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/)\n* [Evaluating Your Routine: Cleansers](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "body": "**Great right up! I would like to point out a few things though**\n\n>##Azealic Acid\n>Azelaic acid stands on its own as an ingredient\n\n...\n\n>is not as irritating as AHAs or BHAs\n  \nI don‚Äôt object to Azealic Acid being grouped here. Its useful for many of the thing bha and aha are and has some similar mechanisms of actions in the skin.\n\nHowever, can this be edited to disclaim Azealic Acid is not actually chemically grouped as an hydroxy acid? Its actually a Dicarboxylic Acid.\n\nI also think it should be disclaimed that since AzA its not a ‚Äútrue‚Äù hydroxy acid ‚Äî it *may* be exempt from some of the aforementioned ‚Äúrules‚Äù of hydroxy acids. First is unless Im r/outoftheloop I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any proof yet that AzA causes photosensitivity and should only be used at night\n\nSecond is while yes, AHA & BHA do have a higher free acid value as pH decreases yes. AzA isn‚Äôt the same. Most brands have AzA their products in the pH range of 4.0-to-5.0 (usally the higher end) because it commonly cited to work best at a pH around 4.8-to-5.0. (*Allegedly,* Finacea is 4.8)\n \nEx:  One study showed that Azealic Acid works better and has a higher bioavailability in the skin at a pH of 4.9 than it does at a pH of 3.9 [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03639045.2011.635376?journalCode=iddi20)\n\n######Limitations of study: Murine Skin\n\nInfo from PubChem Review: Azealic Acid has also had pH comparison studies done, comparing its ability to reduce the activity of p.acnes a pH of 4.0, pH of 5.0 and pH of 6.0. Synopsis ‚Äî at a pH of 5.0 it worked significantly better than it did at a pH of 4.0 and at a pH of 6.0. [Source](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/azelaic_acid#section=Non-Human-Toxicity-Excerpts)\n\nAccording to [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7829407/) it was peer reviewed.\n\n######Limitations of study: Invitro not Invivo\n\nAzA being in a different acid family and being formulated at a higher pH might be attrributed to be why its usually less irritating\n\n>Unfortunately, it is largely prescription-only in the US (going by the prescription name of Finacea), land can only be found in lower concentrations when purchased over the counter. \n\nI think this should be edited aswell. Unlike in Canada, low and high strength Azealic Acid is available in the USA with and w/o an RX in the USA in strengths from 4%-to-20%.\n\n.........\n\n***RX ONLY***\n\n..........\n\n**Azelex** Cream^20%\n\n**Finacea** Gel^15%\n\n**Curology** Custom^4%+\n\n\n........\n\n***OTC/Online/Non-Rx***\n\n........\n\n**PCA Skin** - Pigment Bar^(?%AzealicAcid+?%KojicAcid+?%Niacinamide)\n\n**Sesderma** - Azelac Lotion^(5%AzealicAcid+2%SalicylicAcid)\n\n**Gigi Bioplasma** - Azealic Cream for Oily Skin^(15%AzealicAcid)\n\n**Ecological Formulas** - Melazapam Cream^(20%AzealicAcid)\n\n...\n\n**Edit** \n\n######There are some others I neglected to mention. ‚ÄúPCA SKIN‚Äù also has another product with AzA called ‚ÄúACNE GEL‚Äù. I didnt include his one in the above list with the mainly because unlike the ‚Äúpigment bar‚Äù it seems like the main selling point of this product is not AzA, but actually the 2%SA in it. Also the Azealic acid percentage is undeclared along with the pH. The dermstore star ratings look good. There‚Äôs also ‚Äú*DERMADOCTOR Photodynamic Therapy Age Spot Eraser & Skin Brightener*‚Äù you can get at Sephora an Dermstore. The AzA is probably in a decently high percentage because its high on the list (7th ingredient) unfortunately Idk the pH of it. Note: the star rating  for this on dermstore are pretty low. Jan Marini Bioglycolic Bioclear Lotion‚Äù\nalso contains AzA but I wouldnt waste my money on it. There‚Äôs 2% Salicylic acid and since AzA is lower on the list than SA its most definitely at too low of an amount to make a significant difference. Also the description‚Äôs wording makes if sound like its mainly meant to be used as a peeling lotion and since it has both Glycolic and Salicylic acid I bet the pH is made to be low ‚Äî meaning the little AzA there is, isnt very bioavailabe",

        "body": "good post TY! I will say that the part advising to use acids at night due to photosensitivity is a bit of a myth. It takes something like a week for skin to return to normal photosensitivity-wise after the use of 10% glycolic acid https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12713551. Unless the photosensitivity was actually caused by a reaction with the product on your skin + sun (like it would be with a phototoxic reaction with something like lime juice) the sensitivity and need for sunscreen isn't going to be significantly different by waiting overnight. Especially since most people using an aha in their routine are using it at least once a week and won't ever be back to baseline photosensitivty-wise so to say.\n\nAlso adding that if used for 2 days salicylic acid at close to neutral ph of 6.5 has been found to work as well as at 3.12 with less irritation, which is pretty cool for people with sensitive skin https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x\n\nAgain thanks for making this content!",

While you might have had a bad experience, using acids with retinol will NOT cause more breakouts as you erroneously suggested, and on the contrary many dermatologists recommend using benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with retinols to stave off purging and help acne heal faster.

        "body": "I asked this a couple weeks ago and got little help, so maybe you can help. \n\nMy skin is pretty hearty. I've worked up to being able to handle using a BHA and AHA at the same time. Couple questions though: \n\n1) The PH is usually around 3. Most cleansers leave you around a 5 or so. Can you recommend any cleansers or toners to bring your skin's PH down to the appropriate level before applying HAs? \n\n2) Is there any issue with using two different HAs at the same time? Can I use some stridex pads and then throw some TO Glycolic Acid on top? Or do I want to wait 20 minutes in between each HA?\n\n3) If we are to wait in between HAs, then I wash my skin down to a good Ph to apply my first HA..but then 20 minutes later my Ph is going to be back to a 6. I wouldn't want to wash again, what do I do to repeatedly drag down my Ph??",

    "body": "Hi all!\n\nYears ago, I wrote one of my first skincare guides ever on [keratosis pilaris (KP)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/). A lot of people found it really helpful. There are a lot of great resources on this sub for it now, but I wanted to update my \"guide\" on it because it's so effing old at this point.\n\nI don't have sources for this one since I wrote it mostly through the knowledge I've accumulated over the years since, though [Dr Dray's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo9BV8uNMM) tips on KP are *really* good and I highly recommend her channel!\n\n[Gallery of KP!](https://imgur.com/a/olyBsWS)\n\n---\n\n\n# KP, Explained\n\nKeratosis Pilaris (KP) is a common, frequently inherited disorder of follicular hyperkeratosis (build-up of dead skin), where dead skin cells - known as keratinocytes - form hard plugs within the hair follicle and do not shed properly. It is typically referred to as \"goose bumps\" that never quite go away, appearing as hard bumps. \n\nIt is most commonly found on the arms (particularly the back of the arms) and thighs, but can appear on the butt and face as well, where it is frequently mistaken as acne (if you believe you have KP on your face, please visit a medical professional to confirm). \n\nOne thing about keratosis pilaris that makes it more distinguishable from other conditions is that it is a symmetrical condition, meaning if it appears on one arm, it will appear on the other. \n\nThe bumps are very rough, frequently appearing to be the normal tone of the skin with a small halo of red. \n\nIt is most common in children, affecting up to 50%, but is also frequently seen in adolescents and adults. People who have drier skin, eczema or atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergies, and asthma seem to be the most frequent sufferers of KP, but it can also appear in people undergoing chemotherapy. It worsens in the winter or in lower humidity environments where the skin is most prone to water loss (known as TEWL, or trans-epidermal water loss). It can flare up at any time though, and has no cure, but thankfully can be managed at home with ease.\n\n# Cleansing KP\n\nAs I said before, KP is most prevalent in people with drier skin types. As such, it is very important to look for soap-free cleansers that will not strip the precious lipids from the surface of the skin, drying out the skin cells, and creating a build up of dead skin. \n\nThis means avoiding bar soaps (frequently very drying due to their high pH value and ability to strip away lipids indiscriminately) and even liquid soaps. Soaps containing SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) and even it's gentler cousin, SLES (sodium laureth sulfate) are frequently far too drying for the parched skin of KP and should be avoided. \n\nSome people find value in gently scrubbing their KP with a washcloth or sponge to loosen the dead skin cells to help them shed, though aggressive scrubbing should be avoided if your skin is sensitive, as aggressive scrubbing can cause inflammation and actually make the KP _worse_.\n\n# Moisturizing KP\n\nMoisturizing the body, particularly the areas affected by KP, is incredibly important with KP. When moisturizing, be sure to put moisturizer on straight out of a shower, before drying off. This will lock the moisture from the shower into your skin, and slow down TEWL. \n\nSufferers of KP should also look for products that are keratolytic (meaning they can break down the \"glue\" that holds skin cells together, allowing them to shed), such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. For some, tretinoin and adapalene (Differin) may also prove helpful. \n\nIf your KP is particularly aggressive, try moisturizing twice a day - with a thick, creamy moisturizer in the day, and a keratolytic moisturizer at night.\n\n# Managing KP on the Face\n\nAs I mentioned before, KP can appear on the face, though I've only been able to find examples of facial KP in children, so I apologize for the lack of photos of facial KP on adults. \n\nRegardless, many of the same rules apply, with some differences to account for the sensitive nature of the facial skin. \n\nLook for creamy cleansers that will not strip the skin of essential moisture, or consider using a wash with salicylic acid (SA, also known as BHA). Feel free to use this cleanser around the areas most affected, massaging it in with your hands. Rise with lukewarm water and pat dry. From there, apply your moisturizer. I prefer moisturizers with low percentages of urea, but you may do better with a glycolic or lactic acid (AHA).\n\n# Other Notes\n\nAvoid taking very hot showers or baths if possible, and reduce your showers to once a day at max. Water, especially hot water, can still be very stripping to dry skin. If you're in a drier climate or running the heater, use a humidifier in your bedroom at night to keep humidity levels higher, which will reduce the rate at which skin dries out. \n\nShaving the hair, waxing, and epilating can all aggravate the condition, so if your KP is particularly resistant to at-home treatments, consider laser hair removal. \n\nIf your skin begins to feel raw, irritated, or tender after using products containing AHAs or BHAs, back down on frequency. Body skin is pretty resilient to these ingredients in my experience, but it is still possibly to over-do it. Stick with moisturizing twice a day, once with the creamy moisturizer and once with the keratolytic moisturizer. Adjust as needed, swapping out the AM creamy moisturizer with a keratolytic moisturizer if you need more _oomph_. \n\nOne last note: if you have tattoos, keratolytic ingredients such as glycolic acid are perfectly fine and safe to use over your tattoos. They do not penetrate deep enough to disrupt the ink, and in fact may brighten your tattoos by sloughing off the dead skin in the stratum corneum that dulls their color.\n\n# Product Recommendations\n\nAs I mentioned, KP is all about dry skin and moisture, so look for products that can boost the moisture content in the skin. I'll be breaking down my recommendations into creamy cleansers and keratolytic cleansers as well as creamy moisturizers and keratolytic moisturizers. \n\nMost people do not see resolution of their KP until they add a keratolytic product to their routine and remove their drying cleanser, so I recommend starting there.\n\n## Creamy Cleansers\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Body Wash (Body)**\n\n>_Water,

    "body": "Long-time lurker, first time poster here! :)\n\n**About me:** 27, humid temperate climate, acne prone and used to be dehydrated. Before I got into AB, I used the usual extremely drying and abrasive products marketed for acne-prone skin, which naturally just exacerbated the situation. Even when I got Differin prescribed, it didn't actually solve my problem. I got into AB about 2 years ago, initially because I was searching for a BB cream to cover up my spots. Then I fell down the rabbit hole and continually, through the occasional mistakes, learned what my skin reacts to well and what not.\n\nIf I had to say what my #1 takeaway from AB has been, I'd say it is the importance of *hydration*. I used to have extremely oily skin and would pretty much always be dealing with the cycle of acne and PIH. Ever since I found a routine that properly hydrates my skin and started using cleansers that do not strip my skin completely dry, both of those things have gotten less and less, *and* I learned that I don't actually have oily but normal/combo skin that is prone to dehydration. With the addition of acids in my routine (especially the BHA), I actually no longer even *get* spots, unless I put products on my face that have ingredients that my face seems to hate (I am lookin' at ya, hydrogenated castor oil!! \\*shakes fist\\*). But even those seem to heal within one or maximum two days, ever since I learned how to handle the breakouts ( shoutout to niacinamide for saving my skin on more than one occasion). Two issues I am still dealing with are redness (in my laugh lines around my nose), and I am still on the way to reducing the appearance of pores around my nose and cheeks - but I think I've worked out a good routine for that as well, and it is now only a matter of time for that to kick in! Yay! Gosh, this makes me so happy.\n\n[Before/After Pics, Please Disregard my Eye Bags, They Were a Genetic Gift](https://imgur.com/a/3onTh0s)\n\n(Routine at the bottom!) Also, sorry for the occasional typos/weird expressions, I'm not mother tongue.\n\n# Some lessons I learned through my journey\n\n1. **What you think is ingredient intolerance might just be a compromised moisture barrier** I on more than one occasion initially broke out from products because my moisture barrier was compromised - and now that my moisture barrier is healed, my skin *loves* them. Two good examples for ingredients that gave me this reaction were niacinamide and rosehip seed oil. Any product with a high niacinamide percentage initially wrecked my skin to the point that I thought I was allergic to it - but it really was just that it was too irritating for a compromised moisture barrier. Same for rosehip seed oil products: while my skin was lacking hydration, the oil just congested my skin. Now I use it as a last step in my routine and it has been a godsend for healing PIH.\n2. **Start SLOW** I made all the rookie mistakes on the way that everyone warns about: not patch-testing and introducing acids too fast. Overexfoliation gave me the absolute worst breakouts of my life (and *of course* this is plural because patience is not my virtue and I for a while failed to understand that just because I can use BHA every day or every second day, does not mean I can do the same with AHA. Shrug emoji, I'm a moron). Point is: progress takes time. Your skin won't be able to shed everything congesting it in a week, but stick with your routine, be gentle to your skin,  ease into the acids *slowly* and you will be on the path to healing!\n3. **Don't stick with a product for** ***some*** **of its good qualities if it otherwise doesn't cooperate with your skin** My example for this is the Scinic Honey AIO. It is intensely hydrating, the ingredient list is a dream, and I really, really wanted to love it because it did give me a glow. But it also irritated my chin area and made it a little itchy after every application. (My assumption is that it irritates the remnants of my fungal acne, but I'm not sure. It could also be my soy allergy kicking in.) Either way - I kept using it for a long time, hoping that eventually the irritation would go away. It did not. And ever since I stopped using it, my skin has actually been looking better - and I found other products to give me that glow I always yearned for.\n\n# Reviews\n\n*Cleansers*\n\n* **Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil** Fantastic cleanser, removes any and every makeup. However, it feels like once you wash this off with water, there is always still a small residue of oil on your skin? Which didn't give me a reaction as long as I used a second cleanser, but I always felt just a little paranoid about washing it off properly. WNR.\n* **Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil** I prefer this one over the Deep version. It still melts away all your makeup, but washes off much more quickly and doesn't feel like it leaves a film residue. RP.\n* **Cosrx Low pH Gel Cleanser** I found this one sort of meh. It definitely cleaned really well, I loved the tea-tree smell, but I also felt like it was slightly too stripping for my skin. It also didn't last super long with me. WNR.\n* **Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Wash** I can hear a choir of angels singing the background whenever I think about this product. This cleanser might be the best thing that happened to me during my AB journey. It is incredibly gentle, lasts FOREVER (I used mine for almost a year, because you only need the tiniest, tiniest amount), removes any excess dirt left over from your oil cleanser but without making your face feel too stripped clean afterwards. Straight up HG, I'm not even interested in other cleansers since I'm using this.\n\n*Toners*\n\n* **Hada Labo Gokujyun Moisturizing Lotion (normal and premium)** I'm kind of on the edge about both of these, and might ever so slighty prefer the normal version? Both of them are hydrating toners, so it's really basically just a layer of hydration on your skin without too many extras, but the premium version somehow feels a tiny heavy *and* less hydrating on my skin, which seemingly makes no sense? I tried mixing it with a bit of water and putting it on my face like that, and that was nice, but I am unsure whether I'll keep using these, as I feel I might find other hydrating toners that also provide my skin with something extra. We will see how my skin reacts once I no longer use them. They are definitely a safe, no-fuss product for helping dehydrated skin. On the fence, Might-RP.\n* **Klairs Supple Preparation Toner (scented version)** jklsajsaflsjf LOVE. It is hydrating (although not as much as the Hada Labo), it helps every other product sink in much faster, it is calming, and I think it has helped give a glow to my skin (I can't wait to try more products with licorice root extract). I really enjoy this as a first step in my routine. RP.\n\n*Essences/Ampoules/Serums*\n\n* **Scinic Honey AIO Ampoule** As I have already stated above, this product was one that I really, really wanted to love. On the one side, it has a really impressive ingredient list, on the other, everyone and their mother raves about it. So why should it not work for me, right? Wrong. Whatever's in this glorious bottle of gold does not cooperate with my chin area (and only that, weirdly enough). Otherwise, the product is intensely hydrating, although it takes a couple of minutes to sink in. It also leaves your skin with a glow on top that feels a little sticky for a while, but looks and feels really lovely and hydrating.  It has a faint honey smell. However, due to my adverse reaction, WNR.\n* **Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence** It's a somewhat dense, sticky fluid that takes quite some time to sink in on your skin. For me personally, it felt heavy and even somewhat oily on my skin, and seemed to *never* actually get absorbed into my skin. It made me congested, and gave me milia underneath my eyes. I know it's an HG for many people, but I straight-up hated everything about it. YMMV. WNR.\n* **Benton Snail Bee Essence** This was one of the first products I tried and I found it extremely calming and fast-absorbing on my skin. It faded my PIH spots surprisingly quickly. I think the combination of snail mucin, aloe leaf juice, and arbutin was  fantastic. I first bought it before the price-hike and never actually went back to buy it afterwards because, honestly, while I found it really good, 20 bucks is IMO an atrocious price for 60 ml and there are other products out there that calm your skin and help with PIH that have a much better cost-performance ratio. Get yer arbutin elsewhere, fellas. WNR.\n* **Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum** This is one of the products I thought I'd hate and ended up loving. Granted, I only ever tried it for a short time from samples, but in my experience this was one of the most calming and hydrating things I put on my face. I thought the hype around green tea was only a hype, but this was actually one of the only products that calmed the redness around my laugh lines. The only drawback I saw so far was a very strong artificial smell. I am planning on buying this with my next purchase and trialing it long term, will get back with a proper RP/WNR review in a while then, but I'm really excited about it so far.\n* **Tosowoong Propolis Ampoule** Okay, this bad boy. My takeaway from this ampoule is that it does *wonders* to your skin if you have fungal acne, but seems to do nothing whatsoever if you no longer do? I was extremely excited to try it when I was still battling with breakouts because people said it really calmed theirs, but in my experience, it only calmed my breakouts that were induced by *malassezia* overgrowth. I haven't used up the whole bottle and am actually planning on keeping the rest in case I ever feel like my fungal acne is coming back, because for now it just feels like.. a random not-so-hydrating layer on my skin. WNR, unless fungal acne? (Psst, for those wondering, here are two [great](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6ohgsx/discussion_fungal_acne_my_experience_and_how_i/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/6pap59/journal_4_day_results_after_seeing_the/) about fungal acne)\n* **TO Niacinamide 10\\% + Zink** (non-AB) (Please let me know if I should take this review out due to the non-AB) This one can do wonders *if* you listen to your skin. My experience with this so far is that it will irritate my skin into an absolute mess if I use it every day or don't make sure to moisturize and hydrate the *heck* out of my skin beforehand. *However,* this has become my spot-treatment/use-once-every-two-weeks-as-a-preventive-measure-all-over product. As a spot treatment, I find that putting it on developing spots completely makes them not ever surface and just heal away, and as an all-over-preventive-measure well, I haven't had acne in a while? But again, I cannot stress the importance of hydrating beforehand and *only, and only ever using this on a healthy moisture barrier.* RP once I ever run out, but that will be in ages as you only need the tiniest amount.\n* **Goodal Moisture Barrier Liquid** Pros: Very hydrating and really good at keeping my moisture barrier well-behaved. Con: the alcohol in it irritates my skin a bit, so WNR, and will try to look for an alternative.\n\n*Creams*\n\n* **Cosrx Snail AIO Snail Cream 92** My skin adores this. It calms my redness, but I think that its most impressive quality is that it plumps my skin like crazy. My skin is really iffy about anything with cream in the title, but this does not break my out, either. It's a little sticky but absorbs well. RP.\n\n# Current routine\n\nAB-Western Hybrid.**Skin Type: Dehydrated and Acne Prone | Country/Climate I'm in: Germany, Humid | Top Skin Concern: texture, PIH | Soy allergy, hence steering clear of products with soy ferments or soy protein in them.**\n\nAM\n\n1.

There are a few things I want to clear up before I start:\n\n\\- This is not a post to start drama or to say bad things about Boxycharm OR Faccia Skin. This is simply research on the claims of the product and whether or not there is evidence that these claims are true. I intend to make NO speculations about this and only present the facts as I can find them (and cite them). If I do make any speculations, please call me out for it and I will remove them.\n\n\\- I am not going to tell you whether or not to use this product. This is just the information I think you should have to make an educated decision for yourself.\n\n\\- I have no stake in this product and hope that makes me as unbiased as possible. I don‚Äôt receive premium, and I don‚Äôt intend to buy. None of what I say here is based on my experience with the product OR any reviews of the product. \n\nFinally, the intention of this is to investigate these claims based on being an ‚Äúaverage consumer.‚Äù I know that the actual average consumer does not actually do this much research. What I mean by this is that all this information comes from available online databases and resources, and the first couple pages of Google. I‚Äôm not doing a deep dive into any Instagram pages or people‚Äôs private lives to find this information. I intend for all of it to be easily verifiable by anyone who wants to find it.\n\nI will investigate 4 things about this product: cruelty free claims, safety of ingredients, benefit claims, and retail value.\n\n**Cruelty Free Claims:**\n\nAccording to [Cruelty Free Kitty](https://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/cruelty-free-101/cruelty-free-bunny-logo/) there are no laws to regulate when a company claims to be cruelty free. However, there are three organizations that have standards to verify a company‚Äôs cruelty-free status, and then allow them to use their logo to indicate to consumers that the product has met that set of standards. \n\nFaccia skin uses the PETA ‚ÄúBeauty without Bunnies‚Äù logo on their packaging, which means they claim to meet PETA‚Äôs standards as a cruelty-free company/product. Also according to Cruelty Free Kitty, if a company uses the logo but does not appear on PETA‚Äôs list of approved companies, you CANNOT verify that the product is cruelty-free.\n\nFaccia Skin DOES NOT appear on PETA‚Äôs list of approved companies, despite using the logo. According to PETA, in order to use the logo, a company must first be verified as Cruelty-Free by PETA, and THEN is able to pay a one-time $100 licensing fee to use the logos on their products ([PETA](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/info-businesses/beauty-without-bunnies-program/)). That means that if Faccia Skin is using the logo, they should already be on the list despite being a new company. The FAQ also suggests that this list is updated frequently so consumers are always up to date with additions, deletions, and other changes. [PETA FAQ can be found here.](https://features.peta.org/cruelty-free-company-search/index.aspx)\n\n**TL;DR ‚Äì Faccia Skin‚Äôs cruelty-free status cannot be verified.**\n\nNote here: Other research on this sub has suggested that this company is owned by the same owner as DLS cosmetics, which is both PETA and Leaping Bunny certified. They may be licensing the logo legally, but from what I can tell, does not verify the cruelty-free status of this brand specifically. \n\n**Safety of Ingredients:**\n\nThis is the list of ingredients for this moisturizer on Faccia‚Äôs website:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, GOLD, HYDROLYZED SERICIN, CARBOMER, BETAINE, TAURINE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, NIACINAMIDE, BUTANEDIOL, POLYSORBITULE-20, PALMITOYL OLIGOPEPTIDE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, ACETYL TETRAPEPTIDE-5, ACETYL HEXAPEPTIDE-8, EDTA-2NA, HYDROLYZED PEARL, FUCUS VESICULOSUS EXTRACT, SODIUM POLYACRYLATE, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, METHYLPARABEN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, DIAZOLIDINYL UREA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE, PARFUM, CI19140\n\nVia SkinCarisma, 8 products on this list have an EWG Health Rating of ‚ÄúModerate‚Äù or ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù risk.\n\nModerate risk:\n\nGold ‚Äì SkinCarisma identifies this as a ‚Äúcosmetic colorant‚Äù with no benefits\n\nTriethanolamine ‚Äì This has a comodogenic rating of (2). Incidecoder says that this ingredient is generally safe, but can form carcinogens if it is included in a product with nitra-/nitro- type ingredients. I don‚Äôt see any of those ingredients in this list.\n\nMethylparaben ‚Äì This is a paraben (obviously). There is nothing directly unsafe about using this ingredient. There was a 2006 study that found that skin cells treated with MP had more harmful exposure to sunlight than non-MP treated skin cells. This study was done in a lab and not on actual human skin, so there‚Äôs no direct link to this being harmful. When in doubt, wear sunscreen\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea ‚Äì A preservative, This ingredient is controversial because it belongs to a family of ingredients that may break down into formaldehyde when added to a formula. A 1990 study found that it is safe in concentrations of <0.5%. The evidence on this is unclear, and since we don‚Äôt know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can‚Äôt say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nIodopropynyl Butylcarbamate ‚Äì Also a preservative. This is safe in concentrations of less than 0.1%, and has an extremely low rate of skin irritation. Since we don‚Äôt know what the concentration of this ingredient is, I can‚Äôt say definitively if it is safe or not. Use your best judgement.\n\nHigh Risk:\n\nButane ‚Äì Incidecoder brings this up as Butanediol, which is a solvent to help products absorb faster. Its safety has not yet been questioned. It‚Äôs sometimes used as a food additive. HOWEVER the ingredients list does actually say Butane and not Butanediol which is used as a propellant. It‚Äôs still safe but it doesn‚Äôt make sense for an ingredient that is not aerosolized.\n\nFragrance ‚Äì The problem with this ingredient is that ‚Äúfragrance‚Äù is a general term that can be made up of an average of 30-50 chemicals that aren‚Äôt required to be disclosed. A lot of products use this term and are still safe, but because all the ingredients are not disclosed, we can‚Äôt say for sure. Use your best judgement.\n\nOther:\n\nPolysorbate 20 ‚Äì listed as a fungal acne trigger, but is an emulsifier and is safe.\n\nYou can find all this information at incidecoder.com and skincarisma.com\n\n**TL;DR : Basic judgement says that this product is safe to use, unless you are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients on this list, react to comedogenic products, or have fungal acne.**\n\n**Benefit Claims:**\n\nOn Faccia Skin‚Äôs website, they make the following claims about this product:\n\nHydrate skin ‚Äì We can expect this result based on moisturizing ingredients (glycerin, betaine, sodium hyaluronate, niacinamide, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, PEG-40, Propylene Glycol)\n\nAnti-aging ‚Äì SkinCarisma lists Niacinamide as the only anti-aging ingredient.\n\nStrengthen skin ‚Äì SkinCarisma lists Sodium Hyaluronate as an ingredient to promote would healing. Incidecoder also suggests that there are peptides in the ingredients which act as ‚Äúcell-communicating‚Äù agents. Peptides are fairly common in other products that claim strengthening benefits.\n\nEnhance skin ‚Äúradiance‚Äù ‚Äì We can expect this based on the ingredient Niacinamide as well as moisturizing ingredients. Skincarisma lists Niacinamide as a ‚Äúbrightening‚Äù ingredient.\n\nReduce damaging environmental factors ‚Äì This may be aided by Sodium Hyaluronate as a ‚Äúwound-healing‚Äù ingredient.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that neither of these ingredient databases list gold as an ingredient with any skin benefits. Here‚Äôs some research on the benefits (or not) of gold for the skin from what I believe to be trustworthy sources:\n\n[https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/sensitizing/gold.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/fashion/27skinWEB.html)\n\n**TL;DR ‚Äì We can expect for this product to perform as it claims based on its ingredients. It is unlikely that gold provides any notable benefits.**\n\n**Retail Price:**\n\nI did a quick search of ‚Äúbest 24k gold moisturizers‚Äù to compare retail prices for other notable products. It‚Äôs hard for me to definitively test the ‚Äúretail price‚Äù claim unless there was a very similar product out there that I can find. So I‚Äôll have to base this on comparisons as well as knowledge of the ingredients themselves. I don‚Äôt know the exact volume of the cream in mL so we are going to assume for now that 50g = 1.6 fl oz someone can get me the actual volume I will change this. So $100 for 1.6 oz is $62.5/oz\n\n[Orogold](https://www.orogoldcosmetics.com/shop/orogold-cosmetics/white-gold/24k-deep-moisturizer/) 24K deep moisturizer: $55/oz \n\n[Physicians Formula](https://www.physiciansformula.com/physicians-formula-24-karat-gold-collagen-moisturizer.html) 24k Gold Collagen Moisturizer: $12.5/oz \n\n[Chantecaille](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/chantecaille-nano-gold-energizing-cream-1-7-oz-prod50660039?childItemId=NMC0BE1_) Nano Gold Energizing Face cream: $247/oz \n\n[Farsali](https://www.sephora.com/product/rose-gold-elixir-P417139) Rose Gold Elixer (24k infused) - $54/oz \n\n[Peter Thomas Roth](https://www.sephora.com/product/24k-gold-mask-pure-luxury-lift-firm-mask-P392607) 24k Gold Mask - $17/oz \n\n[Nuface](https://www.ulta.com/gel-primer-24k-gold-complex-brighten?productId=xlsImpprod13521083) Gel Primer 24k Gold Complex - $19.5/oz \n\n[Ahava](https://www.ulta.com/24k-gold-mineral-mud-mask?productId=pimprod2004002) 24K Gold Mineral Mud Mask - $34/oz \n\nThe Faccia cream has a price/oz most similar to the Orogold and the Farsali products, and is much cheaper than the Chantecaille cream which is a luxury brand sold at Neiman Marcus. Comparing the Chantecaille incredients list to the Faccia cream, they are very different. The luxury cream has a huge list of various plant oils, extracts and perfumes. That doesn‚Äôt make it better, but it does have more ingredients. The Faccia base of water and Glycerin is similar to other water based moisturizers like Neutrogena Hydroboost, Simple, and even Tatcha Water Cream (although all 3 of those contain dimethicone and variants). Tatcha contains some more ingredients like plant extracts. It‚Äôs difficult to compare the ingredients lists of the Farsali and Orogold because the textures of the products are so different. However, the Farsali oil ONLY contains 24k gold, vitamin E, and plant oils as the ingredients, and is still cheaper than the Faccia moisturizer. Additionally, the Orogold lists Gold as one of the last few ingredients.\n\nThere doesn‚Äôt appear to be anything in the ingredients list other than gold that would justify such a high retail price. Even other notable brands sold at Ulta and Sephora with gold in them do not reach that retail price, which suggests that the gold alone would not be enough to justify such a high retail price. In fact, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Methylparaben are all described as ‚Äúcheap‚Äù ingredients on Incidecoder. One of the other star ingredients, niacinamide, is in a lot of products, and I can‚Äôt find anything that would indicate it is expensive. You can buy a niacinamide 10% suspension from The Ordinary for less than $6/oz.\n\n**TL;DR: The retail price of $100 is not justified by any ingredients or similar product retail prices.**\n\nMy conclusion: There is nothing wrong with this product at face value since It is safe for most people to use. If cruelty-free products are important to you, I would not use this product until the company‚Äôs cruelty free status is verified. As far as retail value goes, there isn‚Äôt any reason for you to repurchase at the retail price, unless you love this stuff and you can afford it. For other people, a basic silicone-free gel moisturizer with niacinamide should give you similar results for a lower price point. You can make your own decision about whether you should use it, but now you are educated on what it is, and you hopefully have a better idea of what you‚Äôre putting on your body.",

Follow the process of cleansing, toning, serum, exfoliating, moisturizer...the massaging of the skin in itself will show benefits!

    "body": "# Background\n\nSkinceuticals CE Ferulic is considered the best vitamin c serum that money can buy in the skincare market today. In fact, many people have sweared by the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, claiming that it makes a larger difference in their skin compared to other vitamin c alternatives. At $166 per oz, it's not as easily accessible by the average consumer. The reason why it's so expensive is because Skinceuticals currently holds the patent for the perfect ratio of vitamin c, vitamin e, and ferulic acid needed to optimize the effectiveness of vitamin c.\n\nThe \"golden ratio\" is **15% L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)**, **1% Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**, and **0.5% Ferulic Aced** with a pH level between **2.5 - 3.0**. Skinceuticals CE Ferulic is also **fungal acne safe**.\n\nGiven the price, there have been a lot of posts and comments asking for dupes of this product.\n\n**Disclaimer: This post is not sponsored. I used my own money to purchase Skinceuticals and Dr.Brenner for the advancement of skincare data.**\n\n## Why should I use Vitamin C?\n\nI'm not going to go into this too much since that's not really the focus of the post, but you can read more about the research behind Vitamin C here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin\\_c\\_recs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/vitamin_c_recs)\n\n## Popular Dupes\n\nThere are some well known popular dupes of Skinceuticals out in the skincare market today. Keep in mind, none of the dupes listed will have the exact same formulation as Skinceuticals due to the patent. Below are some popular dupes and the differences it has with Skinceuticals.\n\n**Paula's Choice C15 Booster**\n\n[Link](https://www.paulaschoice.com/c15-super-booster/777.html)\n\nPrice: \\~$65/oz\n\nDisclaimer: I have not tried this product.\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Paula's Choice C15 Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water (Aqua), Ascorbic Acid, Butylene|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Glycerin,|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Castor Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Tocopherol,|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Norleucine Acetate, Lecithin, Ferulic|\n||Acid, Panthenol, Bisabolol, Oryza Sativa|\n||(Rice) Bran Extract, Propyl Gallate,|\n||Sodium Gluconate, Sodium Hydroxide,|\n||Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.|\n\nPaulas's Choice claims that this a **15% Vitamin C formula, 1% Vitamin E,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid** at pH of **3.1**.

They also claim that it is at a pH of 2.5‚Äì3. NuFountain **is fungal acne safe**.\n\nMini Review: I did not see any difference using this vitamin c product for a few months, so I discontinued its use.\n\n# Skin(care) Background\n\nI have Asian, sensitive, combination hormonal/acne prone skin. I have lots of PIE due to old acne and lots of freckles and sun damage on my skin due to the fact that I've lived in Hawaii for most of my life.\n\n## Current Routine\n\nMorning:\n\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n* Shiseido SPF40 Sunscreen\n\nNight:\n\n* La Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash\n* Tretinoin 0.1% cream\n* ILLI Ceramide Ato Lotion\n* Hado Labo Tokyo Skin Plumping Gel Cream\n\nTret has made my skin extra sensitive. For example, my skin is now unable to use the Cerave hydrating cleanser due to how sensitive it is. The La Roche Posay cleanser is the only non irritating cleaner I can use now that I am on Tret.\n\nI have tried multiple Vitamin C products on my skin over the years. Specifically, I've tried Melano CC, NuFountain C20, The Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension, and Philosophy Vitamin C Powder.\n\nI have never been able to spot any visible improvement whenever I started using *any* brand of Vitamin C on my skin.\n\n# Review\n\nThere's quite a number of reviews between Skinceuticals CE Ferulic VS Timeless 20% Vitamin C and Paula's Choice C15 if you make a quick Google search. I didn't want to add to those stats as I think there's enough data there. This post is mainly going to review Skinceuticals CE Ferulic vs Dr.Brenner's 20% Vitamin C Serum. In my opinion, Dr.Brenner is the closest dupe, ingredients wise, to Skinceuticals CE Ferulic.\n\n## Packaging\n\n[Packaging](https://preview.redd.it/y21w3rkgcmi51.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=440c465d015a4ab5b9a285ece3ca393f24c7b33a)\n\nSkinceuticals came in a blue paper box, wrapped in plastic. The actual bottle is pretty opaque, but would definitely still allow light through given that it's glass and I was able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nDr.Brenner's came with the glass bottle wrapped in plastic. The bottle was just as opaque as Skinceuticals, and I was also able to see the serum line quite clearly.\n\nThe general guidance for both is to store in a cool, dry place. I've also read online that Vitamin C should be exposed to as little light as possible. Given that, I think Skinceutical's does a better job protecting the product until it gets to the consumer's home given the paper casing. For Dr.Brenner, it's possible for it to be exposed to light while waiting for it to be packaged and sent. However, they do claim on Amazon that they create their Vitamin C serum every 2 weeks to make sure it's fresh.\n\nI stored both of mine in a cupboard, so they're both only exposed to light when I take it out and use it. However, I kept my Skinceuticals in the paper casing while I stored it in the cupboard.\n\n## Product\n\n**Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamin-L-Ascorbic-Hyaluronic-Dr-Brenner/dp/B07ZG28M2S/)\n\nPrice: $24.99/oz\n\n|Skinceuticals Ingredients|Dr. Brenner Vitamin C Ingredients|\n|:-|:-|\n|Aqua/Water/Eau, Ethoxydiglycol,|Water, Ethoxydiglycol,|\n|Ascorbic Acid, Glycerin,|L-Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Propylene|\n|Propylene Glycol, Laureth-23,|Glycol, Glycerin, Laureth-23,|\n|Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol,|Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Sodium|\n|Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate.|Ferulic Acid, Panthenol,|\n||Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol|\n\nAs you can see, the ingredients used in Dr.Brenner is the same as Skinceuticals, although the ordering seems to be different. Dr.Brenner claims that the ratio is **20% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, 1% Hyaluronic Acid,** and **0.5% Ferulic Acid**. Unfortunately, I do not know the pH nor do I have anything to find out the pH of Dr.Brenner. Dr.Brenner **is fungal acne safe**.\n\n## Method\n\nI applied Skinceuticals to the left side of my face, and Dr.Brenner to the right side of my face every morning for 1 month, adjusting for irritation. I also applied the same sunscreen to my entire face after applying the vitamin c serums.\n\n## Thoughts\n\n**Skinceuticals CE Ferulic**\n\nThis has a really strong hot dog smell. The reviews are spot on about this. It really does smell like I'm rubbing hot dog water on my face. The serum is a pale yellow. The texture is slightly more viscous than Dr.Brenner's. The best way I can describe it is that it has the texture of thick water.\n\n**Dr.Brenner Vitamin C Serum**\n\nThis has a faint hot dog smell, not as strong as Skinceuticals. The texture is not as thick as Skinceuticals, it's more runny and has a closer texture to water, possibly due to the higher hyaluronic acid content. The coloring is a lighter yellow than Skinceuticals.\n\nMy before pictures are from when I applied the Vitamin C serums for the first time on each side. My after pictures are 1 month after daily morning application of the Vitamin C serums.\n\nI found that the Dr.Brenner serum is more irritating on my skin than Skinceuticals. I found that the side where I usually apply the Dr.Brenner serum usually gets more red and irritable compared to the Skinceuticals side. However, this only happens when my skin needs a break from Tret, and the irritation usually goes away if I take a break from Tret for a day.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n[Before Front](https://preview.redd.it/pu2biihlcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fc6d699da9c03071fedefbf839616465bddf31b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/pbx6am5ncmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8781476d62dbbf083a306021e119563fd226742)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Before Dr. Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/yr2ofgzocmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be97af34e9328346fb0b41825bf547bce93c3c3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Front](https://preview.redd.it/b6v0kgoqcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c50ddcdda52d39e8b434fe78d1e0147ff35c41b7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Skinceuticals](https://preview.redd.it/wajzo5zrcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cee0f78bdf18dfe3bd284ed2406eb1b08e753b53)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[After Dr.Brenner](https://preview.redd.it/24ub6lbtcmi51.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a7c5406f55dd31b8823a9ff2a62cba875f2ce29)\n\nResults wise, both sides look pretty similar to me, with the Skinceuticals side looking a bit better. However, this could be due to the fact that I just had more acne scarring on the Dr.Brenner side than the Skinceuticals side. Given the fact that I don't think the difference between the two sides is all that large and my experience with them is mostly similar, I would go for the Dr.Brenner serum and probably apply it every other day. However, if you don't have sensitive skin like mine, I still would recommend Dr.Brenner's serum over Skinceuticals. The reason being that I just don't see *that* large of an improvement from Skinceuticals over Dr.Brenner to justify the 8x price tag. The ingredients are also *very* similar, with the only difference being that Dr.Brenner has more hyaluronic acid.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea. Female respondents. n=patients**\n\nPRODUCT | % (n=1,023)\n---|---|----\n|Astringents and Toners|49.5%|\n|Soap|40%|\n|Makeup|29%|\n|Perfume|27%|\n|Moisturizers|25.5%|\n|Hairspray|20%|\n|Shampoo|12%|\n\n**TABLE 3.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

His trigger seems to be getting dirt/debris/sweat on is skin, so it‚Äôs been a challenge to say the least. We had a particular challenging weekend of yard work where he was outside for maybe 15 minutes with minimal sweat and he still had a flare up after he thoroughly cleaned his face. \n\nI‚Äôm going to pass this information along to him and read it myself so I can get a better understanding of what we can try.

        "body": "My Mom had subtype 3, with thickened skin. She had it really badly her whole life. I have some rosacea but have done my best to try to not wind up like her.  Sadly, I gave up on facial sunscreen a number of times because they irritated me or made my eyes swell shut. I currently use Dermologica which is really spendy and I am not sure it's coverage is that great, but it's the only thing I can use on my whole face so far.\n\n\nTwo things than help me a lot were cutting out black pepper and using more foundation. Environmental irritants wreck me, it seems. I used to wear moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, power, liquid, more powder and then setting spray. Very heavy coverage, but I realized that pretty much sealing my cheeks off from the world made them finally calm down, or maybe it was something in the primer. I kept at it for a long time, but now use lighter coverage. My cheeks are red, but not nearly as bad. Between that and two laser treatments I think of my problem as under control, but can't go out barefaced. And since age is a trigger I could be unknowingly doomed to the burning sensation and painful cysts Mom had, but try to live like that isn't lurking around the corner. \n\n\n\nI've never been able to use anything anti-aging, so the ideal that a retinol might actually help me is very intriguing. All my current doc will prescribe me is metrolotion, which never helped in the slightest. I might go talk to a derm at my own cost and see if that or rhofade might be good for me.",

When done in-office, treatments are spaced a few weeks to a month apart.\n\n* Done improperly you can end up with hypopigmentation (white or colorless spots in the skin that do not return to a normal color)\n\n* It hurts.\n\n* You can not fully sterilize the needles at home. They can be sanitized at best.\n\n* The needles can become bent over time, or come from the manufacturer already bent. Small bends can be imperceptible to the naked eye and can cause unwanted damage to your skin.\n\n**Because of these risks, ScA does not recommend attempting dermarolling or dermastamping at home.

Most products that claim to mend split ends don‚Äôt have these two ingredients. Also, both ingredients are required for the mending to work and withstand other stresses like combing. \n\n#Here‚Äôs the study done on these two ingredients showing the semi permanent mending effects: \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/6111412_Semi-permanent_split_end_mending_with_a_polyelectrolyte_complex\n\n##Brief explanation:\n\nThe cationic, anti static ingredient **polyquaternium-28** is attracted to the anionic ingredient **PVM/MA copolymer**. The idea is that damage and split ends are anionic so the polyquaternium-28 is attracted to them and will bind them together until it is washed out. In the study, these two ingredients were shown to bind together split ends and also withstood the stress of combing.\n\n#Here are some products I FINALLY found that have these two ingredients:\n\n#[Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum 4 oz ($20)](https://www.frendsbeauty.com/kim-kimble-healed-ends-serum-4oz.html)\n\nIngredients: \n\nWater (Aqua), **Polyquaternium-28**, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Arctium Majus Root (Burdock) Extract, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Flower Extract, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Extract, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract, Saccharum Officinaru (Sugarcane) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Caprylyl Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ethylhexyglycerin, Betaine, Hexylene Glycol, **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Dimethicone PEG-8 Meadowfoamate, Hexapeptide-11, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nThis one has **polyquaternium-28** as the 2nd ingredient, then some oils, a bunch of extracts, then the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 17th ingredient. Phenoxyethanol as the preservative is fine here since it is being used on the ends, not on the scalp.\n\n#[Color Proof SuperRich Split Ends Mender 3.4 oz ($11)](https://www.beautyplussalon.com/color-proof-superrich-split-ends-mender)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater/Aqua/Eau, Glycerin, **Polyquaternium-28**, Phenoxyethanol, Xanthan Gum, Fragrance (Parfum), **PVM/MA Copolymer**, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxypropyl Cyclodextrin, Polysorbate 80, Caprylyl Glycol, Linalool, Citric Acid, Limonene, Sorbitan Oleate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Citronellol, Citral, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Quaternium-95, Propanediol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Laminaria Digitata Extract, Hydrolyzed Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Lentinus Edodes Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Benzoate, BHT, Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate.\n\nThis ingredients list is interesting, **polyquaternium-28** as the 3rd ingredient is awesome, but the 4th, 5th, and 6th ingredients are two preservatives and a fragrance. That‚Äôs fine, as xanthan gum is also a thickener. Then the 7th ingredient is the **PVM/MA copolymer**. Then there‚Äôs a bunch of emollients and extracts and another preservative that is annoying to see in products. \n\n##This one contains Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, a **formaldehyde releasing preservative**. This is fine, as the formaldehyde is how it preserves the product, but it is always good to be aware of these things, so you don‚Äôt let the bottle sit for a very long time, as this ingredient **releases formaldehyde slowly over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[White Sands The Cure 24/7 Serum 3.38 oz ($20)](https://sleekshop.com/products/white-sands-the-cure-24-7-serum.html?sku=whs09-3-38-oz)\n\nIngredients:\n\nDeionized Water, **Polyaualerium-28**, **PVMMA Copolymer**, Xanthan Gum, Caprylic/Capric Acid, Triglyceride, Cyrribidium Grandilorioum Flower, Propylene Glycol, Diazolidinyl Urea, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate, Fragrance.\n\nThis one has a much more simple ingredients list! **Polyquaternium-28** is the second ingredient and the **PVM/MA** copolymer is the third ingredient. Then there is xanthan gum to thicken and preserve. \n\n##However, again, at the end of this list we have **formaldehyde releasing preservatives**: **Diazolidinyl Urea and Iodopropynyl Butylcarbarmate.** Again, this is fine, but good to be aware of so you don‚Äôt let the bottle sit for a year, as these preservatives **slowly release formaldehyde over time** to preserve the product. \n\n#[OGX Coconut Curls Air Dry Cream 6 oz ($9)](https://www.ulta.com/p/locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-pimprod2005306)\n\nIngredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Tapioca Starch, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Polyquaternium-37, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Polyquaternium-28**, **PVM/VA Copolymer**, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Lecithin, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Fragrance (Parfum)\n\nHere we have tapioca starch to reduce any heavy oily feel. Then some emollients and oils. Then **polyquaternium-28** as the 7th ingredient and the **PVM/MA copolymer** as the 8th ingredient. Then there‚Äôs some more emollients and then the preservative and a fragrance. Phenoxyethanol is a fine because this is for use on the end of the hair, not the scalp. \n\nSo there you have it. You can semi-permanently mend your split ends. It took a LONG time for me to find products that actually had the *combitnation* of BOTH of these ingredients. \n#So if anyone else finds more products that contain polyquaternium-28 and PVM/MA copolymer, please share here!\n\nAlso, for those that can‚Äôt tell, the links are imbedded in the title of the product. So, for example, you can click on the title Kim Kimble Healed Ends Serum at the top of the post and it will take you to the website. The links are imbedded in every title",

    "body": "Companies sometimes share the percentage retinol they use, but it's good to realize this is sometimes not the percentage of the pure retinol, but of a mixture.\n\nPhrases like \"1% coated retinol\" , \"a 1% retinol complex serum\" or we use \"0.5% slow release retinol\" are indicications they could be referring to a mixture/complex. Percentages like 2.5% or 3% are very unlikely pure retinol. There are also products that mention retinol in the product name, while the products doesn't contain retinol, but a derivative like Retinyl Palmitate.\n\nCompanies may list everything below 1% in random order, so often they try to get that 1% line high up on the ingredient list, and then list the actives first to make it look more potent. You could try to spot that 1% line, it can be helpful to determine wether the % is referring to a mixture or to the actual pure retinol. You can also look for ingredients on the inci list that are used in these standard retinol mixtures, commonly used coated/mixture forms can for example be found here:\n\n[https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/na/PersonalCare/search?k=retinol&st=1)\n\nSome ingredients that are commonly used at or below 1%:  Phenoxyethanol, Parabens, Levulinic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glyceryl Caprylate, Tocopherol, Caprylyl Glycol, EDTA's, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Carbomer,  Hyaluronic Acid, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Ubiquinone, Peptides, Retinoids, Ceramides, Fragrance, most plant extracts in powder form etc.\n\n\n\n**First example, M. Asam Retinol 1% Intense:**\n\n* Claim: 1% retinol in encapsulated form\n* Indications it's not 1%: Retinyl Palmitate is usually used below 0.3%. Polyurethane Crosspolymer-1 and Glycine Soja Oil are part of RetiCap PF, most likely this serum contains 0.08% Retinol.\n* Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Oleate Citrate, **Retinyl Palmitate, Retinol,** Panthenol, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, **Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil**, Tocopherol, Lauroyl Lysine, Dipentaerythrityl Pentaisononanoate, Carbomer, Polyglyceryl- 10 Laurate, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, **Polyurethane Crosspolymer- 1,** Caprylyl Glycol, Bht, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hydroxide, Citric Acid, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Second example, Inkey List Retinol Serum:**\n\n* Claim: 1% stable retinol and 0.5% granactive retinoid\n* Indications it's not 1%: Tocopherol, Carbomer in general are not used above 1%. Caprylyl Glycol in combination with other preservatives is in general not used above 1%, this means there's less than 1% Dimethyl Isosorbide (part of) Granactive Retinoid, which contains 10% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, so 0.05% in this formula. Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride (and) Sodium Ascorbate (and) Tocopherol (and) retinol is called RetiSTAR. This contains 5% Retinol, so at 1%, there's 0.05% retinol in this formula. So 1.5% total retinoid, no not really, more likely it's 0.1% max.\n* Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Propanediol, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, **Caprylyl Glycol,** Phospholipids, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Squalane, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Extract, **Carbomer**, Sodium Ascorbate, **Tocopherol,** Polysorbate 60, Tocopheryl Acetate, Glycolipids, Sodium Hydroxide, Disodium Edta, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol,** Glycine Soja (Soybean) Sterol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Polysorbate 20, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Phenoxyethanol\n\n**Third example,**[Dr Brandt 2% Retinol serum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26OFz0DakQc&t=0m13s)**:**\n\n* claim 2% Retinol Complex\n* Why it's not 2%: Tocopherol and Phenoxyethanol are not used above 1%. Could be  \"Retinol C50 by Amcol\" or \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\". So most likely 0.3% at most. Think about how the fancy packaging and marketing makes you think this is really worth $70. With all the fragrance ingredients lie Limonene, Grapefruit Oil and Lavender Oil it's best to skip this product.\n* Water, Glycerine, Dicaprylylcarbonaat, Isoamyl Lauraat, Cyclopentasiloxaan, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Boter, Shea Butter Cetyl Esters, Triheptanoin, **Tocoferol, Phenoxyethanol,** Behenyl Alcohol, Methylpropaandiol, Glycerylstearaatcitraat, Polysorbaat 20, Natriumacrylaten Copolymeer, **Retinol,** Glycerylstearaat , Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Xanthan Gum, Betaine, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate, Citrus Paradisi (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil, Limonene, Chlorphenesin, Caprylyl Glycol, etc...\n\n**Fourth example, Sunday Riley A+ High Dose 6.5% Retinoid :**\n\n* Claim: 5% retinoid ester, 1% liposomal-encapsulated retinol, 0.5% blue-green algea\n* Probably the 5% refers to Granactive Retinoid, you can't use 50% of this, so that means there's 0.5% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Which seems correct since the 1% line is around Diheptyl Succinate, and Dimethyl Isosorbide is the 3th ingredient. The Retinol is less than 1%, it's liposomal encapsulated, so this could be \"Iuvenesens¬Æ B-15\" as well, probably this means there's about 0.2% Retinol at most. So instead of the claimed 6.5% Retinoid, for $85 you are actually getting 0.2% retinol, 0.5% HPR with no indepedant studies on it's anti aging properties, and some unproven plant extract.\n* Water/Eau/Agua, Propanediol, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Triheptanoin, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Hexyldecanol, Disiloxane, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Diheptyl Succinate, Propylene Carbonate, **Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate**, PPG-24-Glycereth-24, Phenyl Trimethicone, **Retinol, Ubiquinone (CoQ10),** Honey Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Algae Extract, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Extract, Opuntia Ficus-indica Fruit Extract, Bisabolol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, **Phospholipids**, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract, Lecithin, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, 1,2-Hexanediol, 4-t- Butylcyclohexanol, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Helianthus Annuss (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Sorbitol, Cetylhydroxyproline Palmitamide, Polysilicone-11, Benzoic Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Sodium Phytate, Glyceryl Polyacrylate, Polysorbate, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Stearic Acid, Brassica Campestris Sterols, PVP, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Sodium Benzoate, Alcohol, Potassium Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Phenoxyethanol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, **Tocopherol**\n\n**Fifth example: Indeed labs Retinol Reface:**\n\n* Claim 1% retinoid fluid, 1% retinol time release complex encapsulated, 3% retinol like peptides\n* Looking at the position of Dimethyl Isosorbide, there's most likely 1% Granactive Retinoid, so 0.1% Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate. Retinol is under the 1% line, I'm not completely sure which form is used but could be Retinol 10S, so this means 0.1% final concentration. Xanthan Gum in normal viscosity products is usually something like 0.2%. Peptides at 3%, this mixture contains 100ppm and 50ppm, so 0.0003% and 0.00015% respectively. So instead of thinking to get 5% pure actives, you are getting something like 0.2%.\n* Water, Dimethicone, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Isononyl Isononanoate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propanediol, Caprylyl Methicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Dimethyl Isosorbide**, Cetearyl Glucoside, Peg-100 Stearate, Butylene Glycol, 4-t-butylcyclohexanol, **Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol**, Sodium Acrylate/sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, **Xanthan Gum**, Glycine **Soja (Soybean) Oil, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,** Polysorbate 80, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, **Retinol**, **Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1**, Acacia Senegal Gum, Propylene Glycol Alginate, Tocopherol\n\n**Cerave Skin Renewing Retinol Serum**\n\n* Claim: encapsulated Retinol\n* They don't mention any percentage, but it is below 1%. They could have used ROVISOME Retinol Moist,  Water (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Lecithin (and) Alcohol (and) **Retinol** (and) Polysorbate 20 (and) Potassium Phosphate. This contains 3% retinol, most likely used at 1-2%, there's 0.03-0.06% actual retinol. So if that is correct I think this is more a beginners retinol.\n* Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides, **Polysorbate 20**, Peg-40 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, **Potassium Phosphate,** **Ceramide Np**, Ceramide Ap, Ceramide Eop, Carbomer, Niacinamide, Isoceteth-10, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, **Triethanolamine**, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cichorium Intybus Root Extract / Chicory Root Extract, **Lecithin**, **Retinol,** Silica, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopherol, **Alcohol,** Hydroxyacetophenone, Citric Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, **Pentylene Glycol,** Xanthan Gum, Phytosphingosine, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter / Shea Butter, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**The Ordinary Granactive 2% Emulsion**\n\n* uses [InuMax Advanced Retinol](https://www.ulprospector.com/en/la/PersonalCare/Detail/2163/637871/InuMax-Advanced-Retinol)\n\nAnd to add one more thing besides the vague percentage marketing, remember that Retinol is very, very unstable. It's very difficult to formulate with pure retinol. So it's understandable companies work with premixed complexes. Though even with these complexes as a consumers you can't be 100% sure it stays stable during the whole shelf life. Some products use dropper bottles or tubes that allow air in formula, and products may have been stored for months in warehouses and stores. It can be fine, but as a consumer it's difficult to know for sure. Remember that for PAO and shelf life stability, tests are done to measure things like bacterial/yeast growth, shifting, pH fluctuations. Doing a stability assay to determine the degradation of specific actives in a formula is **not** a mandatory part of that. PAO and shelf life are thus not a 100% guarantee the actual actives remain stable and effective. If you want something OTC, adapalene is much more stable and you don't have to worry wether you are getting the right percentage, it's a standardized proven formula. It doesn't bind to all receptors and is mainly proven for it's anti acne benefits, but the results for it's anti-aging benefits are promising. Other option could be a Retinaldehyde or a Retinol product that is formulated by a larger well known company, is in airless packaging, and which you store in a fridge at home. \n\n\"It can be difficult to discern the concentrations of OTC retinol and retinaldehyde in a given product as there is no labeling requirement in the  USA to list these concentrations. In general, irritation is a biomarker of efficacy, and formulations that do not produce irriation are unlikely to have significant effects. In addition it is advisable to steer patients toward larger, well-established cosmetics companies with a good reputation. Brandname products from companies that have rigorous quality control and regulations are preferred over products from small manufacturers. Because retinol is a fairly unstable compound and requires proper packaging and storage conditions to maintain efficiency, there can be great variability among preparations.[Cutaneous Photoaging, Watson,  Griffiths, 2019](https://books.google.nl/books?id=6reqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=adapalene+photo+aging&source=bl&ots=AkWsbaI5qq&sig=ACfU3U1l2wWZkLfx3P1VHkbLM_ZyfdoopQ&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjahICuw_znAhXDzaQKHS13DLI4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=adapalene%20photo%20aging&f=false)\" --> to add one thing to this, some studies also indicate that when retinol degrades it becomes more irritating to skin, so irritation is not always a good marker.\n\n\nPersonally I think if you want to be sure, go for prescription tretinoin, that is proven and effective, and often more affordable than retinol as well. Otherwise some options below. \n\n* UK: Dermatica - \"otc\" tretinoin\n\n* US: Curology - \"otc\" tretinoin or Adapalene\n\n* [Paula's Choice 1% Retinol Treatment](https://www.paulaschoice.com/clinical-1pct-retinol-treatment/801.html) - $58/30mL\n\n* [Avene RetrinAl 0.1% Retinaldehyde](https://www.aveneusa.com/retrinal-intensive-cream) - $70/30mL\n\n* [Geek&Gorgeous 0.05% Retinaldehyde](https://geekandgorgeous.com/collections/101-serums/products/a-game-5) $13.50/30mL",

    "body": "For the purposes of this review of multiple products, I‚Äôll be *categorizing items by routine placement* rather than when it was introduced.  These items are very much YMMV but I thought it may be helpful for some who are newer to AB (seen with the large influx of newbie questions I‚Äôve seen in the DHT) or even those wondering about products generally.  Also **this isn‚Äôt a particular look at my routine(s)** or how my routine has transformed as I‚Äôve learned more about my skin; rather, this review is of products used to target particular concerns.  This mega-review really came about after a response comment from /u/theCuriousAmerican (whom I thank for keeping me and much of the board in the loop regarding newer products/ lesser known brands in Korea).  I am over 30 but I haven‚Äôt started picking out my coffin lining just yet (rose gold silk, plz) so be aware this isn‚Äôt really an anti-aging post as I don‚Äôt consider myself having ‚Äúmature‚Äù skin (whatever that means).  As I go through reviews, I‚Äôll also include my rational as to why I purchased a product if it wasn‚Äôt impulse and link any relevant posts from the sub that informed my purchase. \n\nI've decided to break up this review and present categories like a series.  This post will be centered around 1st cleansers, hydrating toners, and serums.  The second post will be centered around oils, moisturizers/occlusives, and masks. *Also, I will only discuss AB/ sub-related products*. While I went through a smattering of samples, they will not be discussed. All products discussed were used for at least 2-3 months, if not longer. \n\nAbout my skin prior to developing a skincare routine: \n\n- extremely oily\n\n- flaky under makeup (my makeup would separate in hours and have dry patches)\n\n- riddled with closed comedones (whiteheads)\n\n- bumpy skin texture (under the skin pimples)\n\n- uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation (PIH)\n\n- icepick scars\n\n\n**1st Cleanser**:\n\n\n*Heimish All Clean Balm*\n\n- Ingredients: [Posted from CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2186231803.html) so take with a grain of salt as anyone can add or delete ingredients. \n\n\nI've been using this balm since February. My initial impression was satisfaction. It melted well (not as well as Clinique's Take The Day Off), a slight herbal/citrus smell which didn't bother me, and a lower price point than TTDO. The price is really the main positive of this product. I don't find it cleans as well as TTDO so I have to use more product to make sure everything is eliminated. Nowadays I don't even wear a full face or any makeup at all really except Heroine waterproof mascara and Beauty People Lip Tattoo. I usually let this balm sit on my face for a minute or two before going at it and it does remove most of these products. Into May, I'm still satisfied with this product. Sometimes I only use this cleanser at night if I wasn't wearing anything but sunscreen since it does the job and I've worn a full face and it does remove base makeup well enough (even though I need to use more of it). It'll also last a bit longer, I'm thinking 2-3 more months, so at least 6 months of use for me. I also like that this comes in travel size (I got a few from a Ohlolly.com promo).\n\n\nRepurchase? I'd likely repurchase TTDO if choosing between the two, yes TTDO is more expensive but I liked that it removed makeup easier, it melted better as well. \n\n\nFor my next 1st cleanser, I'll likely repurchase TTDO or make my own cleanser as a way to dupe Tatcha's oil cleanser (beautiful cleanser, only had a sample but loved the feeling). \n\n\n**Hydrating Toners**\n\n\n*Kikusamusane High Moist Lotion* (30 mL decant)\n\n- Ingredients: [From CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5173202878.html)\n\n\nRemember mid-2016 when kikumasamune was on everyone's lips? I purchased a decant of this hydrator partially on the [buzz](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3tgula/a_letter_to_kikumasamune_high_moist_lotion/?st=j2jobol7&sh=17239e4e) created by the sub and other blogs.  This product seemed like a good way to target PIH and increase hydration for my dehydrated skin.  It took me about 2 months to get through my decant. I'm not gonna go through my use of this product because it's been discussed by this sub so much (do a google search). \n\n\nRather, I'll discuss why I ended up not purchasing a full size of this product. I ended up not purchasing a full size because by then I felt my skin didn't need what the Kiku was offering. I didn't get any significant lightening of PIH, brightening yes but I felt I could get brightening from other products. I could get hydration from other products as well.  And I suppose I just wasn't *impressed* enough to want to purchase it. This was also when I realized I get bored of products and the thought of purchasing a 500 ml product seemed so daunting to finish. LOL. \n\n\n*Hada Labo Albutin Lotion Moist*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Arbutin, Disodium Succinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Methylparaben, PPG-10 Methyl Glucose Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Styrene/VP Copolymer, Succinic Acid, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide (from hadalabousa)\n\n\nI recently finished this product (mid-April) and I'm so happy I never have to use this product again. LOL. I purchased this product in December on ABX. I primarily purchased it because of its ingredient list and was interested in using a product with MAP and Arbutin to see if it could attack my PIH in anyway. Also, I felt it would be another good addition for my skin that leans perma-dehydrated. Little to no smell, watery texture, and economical. \n\n**Performance**: Overall, I was significantly disappointed by this product and the longer my time away from this product the more I'm able to realize why I'm disappointed.  It just didn't do anything. It felt like I was throwing cloudy water on my face most of the time. Cloudy water that wasn't even showing a difference in my skin. I would take days off from using this product and saw no difference in brightness to my face. I also saw no lightening of PIH. I expect my toners to hydrate *at least* and it seemingly failed on this front as well. I added another toner to back up this one but I don't like wasting product so I finished it. I found it as a good way to give myself lotion masks and to hydrate my legs. Essentially, this may be the most boring product I've ever tried. \n\n\n*Meishoku Extra Moisturizing Lotion Moist* \n\n- Ingredients: [From cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f35b176780.html)\n\n\nI purchased this toner around December from the r/abx with the Hada Labo moist.  I didn‚Äôt know what to expect purchasing this product but I did based on the ingredients. I was searching for a product that had ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. I should also add that I was searching for a product that had the 3-1-1 ratio because my face does best with a pretty constant use of acids and I needed something that would deliver on the moisture front. \n\n\n**Performance**: I can't actually say much about this product which I don't know if that's good or bad. It's slightly thicker than the HL moist, it's more moisturizing than HL and I feel like it does more than HL ever did. I still enjoy using it after all this time and I may even repurchase. It absorbs quickly, has no discernible smell, and is pretty economical for the amount you receive vs how long it lasts. If the product ingredient listing is correct and I understand how each ingredient fits, this product may have the 3-1-1 ratio (plz, correct me if I'm wrong as I'd love to know for sure!).\n\n\n*PyunKyang Yul Essence Toner*\n\n- Ingredients: Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Butylene Glycol, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Arginine\n\n\nMy newest toner purchase.  I‚Äôve been using this toner for about 3 weeks so I can only give a first impression.  My main interest in this toner was sparked by [Gothamista‚Äôs YT review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_mJoK4gr4) of this product when she covered the 7 skin layer method.  I was interested in finding another hydrating toner to try out the method as I felt that HL was too thin and really felt more like I was patting ‚Äòcloudy water‚Äô on my face every day. \n\n\nAbout the PKY line: The PKY line was developed by the Pyunkang Oriental Medicine Clinic (info provided by Ohlolly.com).  It boasts a list of ingredients commonly found in these types of products but I was especially interested in milk vecht root extract, which is an extract that I haven‚Äôt come across much in products. (NOTE: I've been searching high and low for any clue of what this ingredient does topically, can't find anything.) I‚Äôm a bit of a lover for simpler aesthetics.  I like it when bottles are plainly labeled and look like they belong in an apothecary.  In this sense, PKY hits all my wants; sleek and simplistic design, electric blue bottle (hard plastic), and **no** dropper. \n\n\n**Performance**: What I expected from this product was hydration and I can say this toner delivered.  The liquid is slightly thicker than HL lotion moist but not too much.  I live in a high humidity area and we‚Äôre going into summer but I don‚Äôt expect to rotate this toner out of my routine.  I tend to only need 2-3 layers for the skin method when I‚Äôm using this toner. I‚Äôve tried doing up to 7 but my skin calls it quits in absorption around layer 5. But I'm also wondering if this product just isn't as easily absorbed as meishoku. I think this product would be a great skin soother, since it comes across as so ...mild and inoffensive (if that makes sense). \n\n\nHave I seen a discernible difference in my skin using this product?  I don‚Äôt think so. I would notice more if my skin didn‚Äôt get the proper hydration it needed from this product but I haven‚Äôt seen that. \n\n\nMISC: There is no discernible smell but I‚Äôm not sensitive to smells.  The bottle is 6.7 oz which is a lot of product and likely this bottle will last me at least 8 months, making the price ($19) very economical. \n\n\nIf I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have another toner waiting to be purchased, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd repurchase this but I already have my sights set on toners by kyotosilk and swanicoco.  \n\n\n**Serums**\n\n\n*OST20*\n\n- Ingredients: Water, Ascorbic Acid, Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Xanthan Gum, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Flower Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Glycerin, Zinc PCA, Panthenol, Niacinamide, t-Butyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ubiquinone, Diisopropyl Adipate (from Wishtrend)\n\n\nI'm going to be honest, I won't say much about this product because this sub seems to have a love+hate relationship with it. But I feel like a complete *sucker* for using this product when Timeless's Vit C formula exists. Reviews by [Holysnails](http://www.holysnails.com/2015/03/a-rant-on-osts-c20-and-c215-serums-and.html) and [Fiddy](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2017/01/04/vitamin-c-serum-101-timeless-vitamin-c-serum-review/) and [sub reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4edywb/timeless_vitamin_c_e_ferulic_serum_review_with/?st=j2joba2v&sh=f554f12e) should have had me clicking to Timeless's site. \n\n\nBut no, I tried OST20 first (at least I don't have to wonder) came away disappointed (easily oxidized, serum-like feeling, faint smell, and a bit tacky on the skin). If I regretted purchases this would likely be the ONE I regret most, especially after using Timeless (water-like feel to the skin, subtle scent, stabilized with vit E and ferulic acid, great pricing). NOTE: Please purchase from Timeless's site, while offered on Amazon I can't say for sure that is Timeless's vendor. \n\n\n*Stratia Rewind*\n\n- Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Ethoxydiglycol, Niacinamide, Propylene Glycol, 2-Dimethylamino Ethanol (DMAE), Panthenol, Hydrolized Rice Protein, N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Tamarindus Indica (Tamarind) Seed Extract, Hydrocotyl (Centella Asiatica) Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin, Diazolidinyl Urea, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA\n\n\nAgain, this is another product that is known enough in the sub that I don't really feel like I need to say much. I purchased this product based on the ingredients. I wanted something with niacinamide + nag and licorice. Also, I wanted to support an independent maker who I know was knowledgeable about skincare. I was really interested to see what this product would do for my skin. NOTE: I purchased before stratia dropped the use of biokelp ferment so I've never tried the newest formulation. \n\n\nFor skin feel, this product was slightly oily but sank in well enough. I found it slightly hydrating/moisturizing but not heavy. It really did help with providing a boost of moisture to my skin while being soothing. \n\n\n**Performance**: Overall, I didn't see any significant change in my skin except for moisture/hydration. My PIH was not lightened and I didn't see significant brightening and really that's what I wanted. \n\n\n*Hungarian Water Essence*/*Mizon Hyaluronic 100 Serum*\n\n- Ingredients (BELIF): Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Officinalis(Sage) Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Peucedanum Graveolens (Dill) Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Rose Extract, Poncirus Trifoliata Fruit Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, *Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, *Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, *Nepeta Cataria Extract, *Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Leaf Extract, *Baptisia Tinctoria Root Extract, *Stellaria Media (Chickweed) Extract, +Alchemilla Vulgaris Leaf Extract, **Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, **Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, **Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Tromethamine, Sclerotium Gum, Ammonium Acryloyldimethltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Trisodium EDTA, ***Fragrance, Citronnellol, Limonene. *Napiers Original Formula. **Napiers Aqua Formula. ***Fragrances of Natural Origin.\n\n- Ingredients (MIZON): Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Copper Tripeptide-1, Butylene Glycol, Sclerotium Gum, 1,2-octanediol, Ethylhexyl-glycerin, Tropolone, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Carppyl/capric Triglyceride,Hydrogenated Lecithin, Stearic Acid, C12-c20alkyl Glucoside, C13-22 Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Cholesterol, Ceramid 3, Triethanolamine, Carbomer, Betula Platpyhlla Japonica Juice, Portaluca Oleracea Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract, Amica Montana Flower Extract, Artemisia Absinthium Extract, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Gentiana Lutea Root Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Rasberry) Fruit Extract, Beta-Glucan, Adenosine, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA\n\n\n**Performance**: I'm putting these two together because I felt like they acted as similar products. Very inoffensive serums with little to no scent. I couldn't pinpoint to their overall effect but I will say that when I started mixing them together before application I saw a def increase in the ...bouncy-ness of my skin. I can't explain it and I'm little miffed that separately they didn't perform but together I loved the effect. I refuse to purchase extract water as I got a deluxe sample size from Sephora (Belif got me on the moisturizer train already) and Mizon did very little for my skin alone so both were a dud in my opinion. \n\n\n******\n\n**Conclusion** \n\nI suppose I should discuss my skin now. Overall, I'm pretty happy with where my skin is although I think I'm gonna need laser work for some PIH or start on tret. I don't get flakes even in the face of all the actives I through at my skin. I barely purge (except for retinol) and I don't break out really. When I do breakout, it's usually from products/ environmental, not hormonal. I guess I have a semi-glow, although IRL I just look semi-sweaty or really shiny with makeup on. I'm not as oily and I usually don't get oily until about 4PM now and my makeup no longer separates. \n\n\nI think what's made the largest difference is introducing a hydrating toner. Before this I cleansed and moisturized but hydration was a key element that I wasn't getting. Adding hydration was such a wonderful step towards aiding my skin and I really think that in those who are new to AB, learning the importance of hydration is critical in understanding your skin. ",

I wrote this months ago; just have a courage to post it now lol.\n\nEverything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. \n\nAlso, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? \n\nFor clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. \n\nLastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.\n\nYou'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.\n\nLet me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]\n\nThis entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. \n\nOther cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]\n\n- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P\n- Langerhans‚Äô Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.\n- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. \n\n&nbsp; \n\nNotice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGoing back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. \n\nAnd now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]\n\n[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)\n \nThese bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some \ncompounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]\n\nThe mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]\n\n\nAlso notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. \n\nHold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]\n\nImpaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*\n\nAba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. \n\nAnd if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n'Kay, going back. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. \n\n*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*\n\nA dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.\n\nBy then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. \n\nProblems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?\n\n\nFourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.\n\n\nQuoting:\n\n> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]\n\nYes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.\n\nWe have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. \"Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne.\" They wouldn't say \"Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try...\" Their answers would probably be, \"What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.\"\n\nBecause it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]\n\nFun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ \n\nBelieve me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.\n\nBefore we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.\n\n**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. \n\nWe have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. \n\n>\"People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It‚Äôs not that ingredients in these are unsafe ‚Äì it‚Äôs the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.\"\nDr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]\n\nWhen a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. \n\nSame goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *\"Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*\". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.\n\n[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). \n\nThese are:\n\n- \"Alcohol Free\"\n- ‚ÄúCosmeceutical‚Äù\n- \"Cruelty Free\"/\"Not Tested on Animals\"\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Organic\n\nAs you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.\n\nOne reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. \n\n[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)\n\n> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).\n\nNevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. \n\n*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**\n\nThis is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. \n\nThose products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. \n\nI'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's have an example.\n\n*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*\n\n[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)\n\n> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum\n\nIngredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly \"deep cleansing\" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. \n\nWhat I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? \n\nNow, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? \n\nDon't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother example:\n\n*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*\n\nWow what's with these \"men\" products that use \"Energy\" \"Fresh\" \"Sport\", \"Cool\"? To make them more *masculine*? lol\n\n[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)\n\n> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract\n\nAnother thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly \"for men\" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. \n\nThese are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? \n\nIt's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. \n\n**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.\n\n[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).\n\nThe skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.\n\nYes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!\n\nSkin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]\n\nWhy is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]\n\nAlso, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]\n\nIt has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. \n\nThe use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] \n\nIdeally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] \n\nEver wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)\n\nHow about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**\n\nProbably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]\n\nSurfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] \n\nIt is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.\n\nBUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that \"squeaky clean\" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.\n\nAvoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**\n\n[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.\n\n- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2\n- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0\n- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0\n\nPersonally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. \n\nKeep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job.

Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]\n\nAll skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** \n\n**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] \n\n**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.\n\n**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]\n\n- *Glycerol/Glycerin*\n\nThis is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA‚Äôs Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] \n\n- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*\n\nThey are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body‚Äôs total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]\n\n- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*\n\nI've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]\n\n- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*\n\nPanthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]\n\n- *Urea*\n\n*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]\n\nApparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?\nUrea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] \n\nThis sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - \"the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin\".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] \n\nBut you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! \"The admonition for acne patients to seek \"oil-free\" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.\"^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.\n\nBecause of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20‚Äì30%.^[54]\n\nJust look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**\n\n[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)\n\n[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer. \n\n\n---\n\n**[References used:](https://docdro.id/0zJ9xzb.)**\n\nEdit: I have to divide this into parts cause of characters restriction.",

    "body": "Rosacea is a frustrating skin condition. Despite how long I've knowingly had the condition, I've struggled with it. Some days are good days, and some days are not so good. There's rarely a single reason I can pinpoint for the bad days, and at times my skin can flare from occurrences so benign that they don't even deserve a note.\n\nThis seems to be the universal problem with rosacea. It is confounding, chronic, and difficult to treat. There is no universal treatment, and for some, the recommended cures can turn into the cause.\n\nCompounding that is the fact that rosacea frequently looks like other skin conditions, such as acne, and the prescriptions for acne can also aggravate the rosacea, undoing any benefits. To make matters worse, rosacea is frequently misdiagnosed and under-treated, leaving sufferers with worsening symptoms that are difficult to reverse.\n\nMy mom had always battled with it, and for decades she was misdiagnosed with acne. By the time she was properly diagnosed with rosacea (subtype 2), she had suffered from broken capillaries and flushing that was difficult to cover with make-up, as well as frustrating breakouts that did not respond to typical acne treatments.\n\nHer story is one that is pretty common with rosacea-sufferers. It's frustrating, painful, and sometimes just embarrassing.\n\nAs I was researching for this article, I uncovered so much that challenged my initial ideas around rosacea. It is without a doubt that skincare and lifestyle habits are the most important things for rosaceans, and hopefully, once you're done with this post, you will be left with answers to some of the questions you started with.\n\n* * *\n\n##**The Curse of the Celts**\n\nRosacea afflicts nearly 30-50% of the Caucasian population, particularly those of European descent. In one genome-wide study conducted in 22,952 individuals whose genomes were &gt;97% European ancestry, they found that 2,618 individuals answered \"yes\" to whether they had been diagnosed with rosacea (roughly 9%). This was consistent with the population data of European countries, where the prevalence of rosacea has been reported as affecting upwards of 10% of the population¬π. This link has earned it the nickname of \"the Curse of the Celts.\"\n\nIt is most common in women, but frequently the most severe in men. It also tends to run in families, and researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder.\n\nAccording to the National Rosacea Society, nearly 90% of rosacea patients say the condition lowers their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% report it causing them to avoid public contact or social engagements. For patients with severe rosacea, nearly 88% said their condition negatively affected their professional interacts, and nearly 51% missed work due to the condition.¬≤\n\n* * *\n\n## **The Subtypes of Rosacea, Defined**\n\nThe National Rosacea Society Expert Committee has identified four major types of rosacea, though subtypes 1-2 are the primary major subtypes that can be accompanied by symptoms in subtypes 3-4.\n\nThe two primary subtypes of rosacea (1-2) are Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea (ETR) and Papulopustular Rosacea (PPR). The common link between all types of rosacea is the constant blush or flush -- called erythema -- that remains present in the central portions of the face. It is the other symptoms, such as flushing, papules or pustules, ocular symptoms, phymatous changes, and telagiectasias, that determine the subtypes.\n\n### **Subtype 1 ( Erythematotelangiectatic or ETR)**\n\nETR presents as erythema with some visible blood vessels (telangiectasias). It has an abscense of papules, pustules, or nodules. ETR patients report a flush that lasts longer than 10 minutes, and usually involves the center-most part of the face, but can also involve the peripheral regions. The episodes can occur from emotional stress, spicy foods, hot baths and showers, hot weather, or with no cause at all. People with ETR frequently describe themselves as extremely sensitive and dry, sometimes accompanied by tightness, itching, and burning or stinging, even with topicals meant to soothe discomfort and redness.\n\n### Subtype 2 (Papulopustular or PPR)\n\nFormerly \"acne rosacea,\" PPR presents with erythema (the common link between all types of rosacea) and can also display visible blood vessels. It is accompanied by papules and pustules, and sometimes swelling (edema) can occur, particularly in the cheeks. It can be dry, scaly, and even itchy, but not respond to heavy moisturizers or creams. A history of flushing and irritation from external stimuli can occur in PPR patients, but the symptoms are usually much milder than ETR patients and are generally less common. Due to the presence of papules and pustules, it is frequently misdiagnosed as rosacea, but generally responds very little to conventional acne treatments, and can sometimes worsen.\n\n**TABLE 1. Findings in patients with Subtype 2 Rosacea prior to treatment. ¬π n=patients**\n\nCHARACTERISTICS|GROUP 1 (n=457)|GROUP 2 (n=127)|GROUP 3 (n=331)|\n---|---|----|----\n|Skin Dryness|65%|66%|69%|\n|Scaling|51%|58%|57%|\n|Itching|49%|51%|52%|\n|Edema (Swelling)|36%|32%|38%|\n|Burning|34%|33%|36%|\n|Stinging|29%|34%|29%|\n|Discomfort|17%|14%|21%|\n\n\n\nPatients with both ETR and PPR report hyper-reactivity to skin products (82% in a survey by the National Rosacea Society), even those meant for sensitive skin types, and UV (sun) exposure plays a large role in both conditions, but especially for patients with ETR.\n\n\nDisruption of the skin barrier (the stratum corneum permeability barrier) plays a large part in rosacea, and all rosacean patients experience increased trans-epidermal water-loss (TEWL), particularly in the areas of the face most effected, such as the cheeks and along the sides of the nose. This disruption plays a large part in why rosacean skin is so hyper-reactive. In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" (discomfort, flush, stinging sensations) of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner.\n\n### Subtype 3 (Phymatous)\n\nSubtype 3 is defined by thickening of the skin, enlarged pores, and surface nodules. It oten presents with bulbous nose (rhinophyma), lumpy, swollen areas (particularly in the cheeks). It can occur in women, but is most prevalent in men. In the past, it was confused for alcohol abuse (the \"gin blossom\"). In 50% of cases, it can cause irritated, bloodshot eyes, which is associated with subtype 4.\n\n### Subtype 4 (Ocular)\n\nThe white part of the eye (sclera) has persistent burning, grittiness, dryness, discomfort, and visible blood vessels. Sties are common in sufferers of ocular rosacea. Inflammation of the eyelid is also common, and pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be recurring. Eye makeup can become painful and increase the symptoms.\n\n* * *\n## **Causes of Rosacea**\n\nThere is a lot of debate around what causes rosacea, and nothing is for certain. Researchers have discovered two genetic variants that may be associated with the disorder, and fairly recent research suggests that the facial redness is likely the start of an \"inflammatory continuum initiated by a combination of neurovascular dysregulation and the innate immune system.\"¬≤ Beyond this, mites have also been considered a contributing factor to the condition (particularly the _demodex folliculorum_ mite). While this mite is present on all people's skin, it was found to be even more abundant in the facial skin of rosaceans.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Other Considerations**\n\nRosacea is frequently accompanied by other conditions. In a study across 6 million people (nearly 83,500 with rosacea), aged 18 and above, researchers in Denmark found that people with rosacea seem to be at higher risk for dementia, particularly Alzheimer's, compared to people without the disease¬≥. It has also been linked to a progressive form of  hair loss in women.‚Å¥  As if this isn't bad enough, according to the National Rosacea Society, 26% of patients reported seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the face, and 28% had SD of the scalp‚Åµ.\n\nRosacea is also a highly inflammatory disease, and some patients may see mild to moderate improvement by adopting a healthier lifestyle that reduces inflammation in the body, such as eating probiotic rich foods (particularly ferments) and turmeric and ginger.\n\nSmoking, drinking, and eating too much sugar can all cause inflammation in the body. Additionally, one study found that women taking birth control pills are at an increased risk of developing rosacea‚Å∂.\n\n## **Caring for Rosacea**\n\nThe most important thing you can do if you have rosacea or think you have rosacea is visit a dermatologist, particularly one that specializes in rosacea (the National Rosacea Society has a [physician finder to help get you started](https://www.rosacea.org/patients/referral.php)). There are many treatments that can create immense improvement. If you lack insurance and live in the US, [Curology](https://curology.com/), an online dermatology service, is an option.\n\nBeyond that, there is no magic bullet, but skincare (particularly cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen) seems to be the most important. Everyone's skin is very different, and rosacean skin is especially individual.\n\n**TABLE 3. Skin care products and skin sensitivity in rosacea.

The cleanser is what you build the foundation of the rest of a skincare routine upon. [I wrote a long post about cleansers that I encourage you to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8jqgmi/research_evaluating_your_routine_cleansers/), and indeed, all of the same rules apply.\n\nRosacean skin is particularly prone to being stripped, with \"true\" soaps (saponified soaps) being the worst, as they have a pH of 9 to 10. True soaps are excellent at removing dirt and debris, but in the process they strip the lipids of the skin, causing increased TWEL, dehydration, altered desquamation (shedding), and increased penetration of topically implied substances.\n\nSyndet cleansers (or synthetic detergent cleansers) are usually less than 10% soap and have a more neutral to acidic pH (5.5 to 7), which makes them minimally stripping. They're made from oils, fats, or petroleum, but are not processed like true soap. These are the gentle cleansers of old, before creamy cleansers were so widely available. These are recommended if you are unable to use creamy cleansers.\n\nIn one experiment on arm skin, the ultra-structural skin changes were monitored after washing with a true soap as well as a mild syndet bar. Electron microscopy revealed changes in the skin structure, including uplifting of cells and an increase in surface roughness after washing with true soap. In contrast, the syndet-washed skin had well-preserved proteins and lipids. **Some examples of syndet cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aveeno Moisturizing Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Oat Flour Avena Sativa, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Water, Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Titanium Dioxide, Citric Acid, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil._\n\n**Dove Sensitive Skin Unscented Beauty Bar**\n\n>Ingredients: Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Tallowate, Sodium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Water, Sodium Stearate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoate, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Maltol, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891)._\n\nCombination bars are another type of cleanser and are typically antibacterial soaps that are quite literally a combination of true soap, syndet, and antibacterial agent. This gives them a pH of 9 to 10. They are not recommended for rosacean skin due to their propensity to strip skin of essential flora.\n\nLipid-free cleansers are what most of us are familiar with. These are the liquid, creamy cleansers that cleanse without soap formations and are designed to leave moisture in the skin. They are some of the most studied cleansers with rosacean patients, and also some of the most recommended. **Examples of lipid-free cleansers recommended for rosacea:**\n\n**Aquanil**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Purified), Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Xanthan Gum_.\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Methosulfate And Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide I, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Polyoxyl,. 40 Stearate, Glyceryl Monostearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum._\n\n#### **Moisturizers**\n\nHydration is integral to the function of skin in all people, but is very important in rosaceans, who have impaired skin barrier function and increased TEWL, regardless of subtype. I've written a full post about the classes of moisturizers, [which you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8k0mb0/research_evaluating_your_routine_moisturizers/).\n\nOcclusive ingredients are very important for this reason. Examples include petrolatum, mineral oil, caprylic/capric triglycerides, silicones (such as dimethicone), lanolin, ceatyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol. Unfortunately, while petrolatum can reduce water loss up to 98%¬π, it can also diffuse into the intercellular lipid domain of the skin, interfering with barrier recovery. This may make it a poor choice for patients with ETR and PPR¬π.\n\n_Note: This was new information to me and very surprising, as petrolatum is recommended for virtually all skin with impaired barrier function virtually everywhere in skincare communities, and I use it myself. __I've done some additional digging and it seems like studies are mixed. There are a fair number of studies that cite that petrolatum products (specifically Vaseline) do not interfere with barrier recovery, while others dispute that occlusive-only coverings (such as Vaseline only as opposed to a product with petrolatum mixed in) are the problem, not petrolatum itself. _\n\nLanolin is also not recommended for rosaceans due to inducing allergic or irritant reactions. Another ingredient to look out for is propylene glycol, which can pose issues for hyper-sensitive skin, even in very low concentrations (&lt;2%).\n\nThe benefits outweigh the downsides though, and rosaceans are encouraged to experiment with products until they find one that works.\n\nWhile not inherently harmful, stearic acid and palmitic acid are some other ingredients commonly found in moisturizers that have the most potential to interact with skin lipids, and thus create reactions in rosacean skin.\n\nMenthol, alcohol, acetone, sodium lauryl sulfate, benzalkonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, camphor, urea, and fragrance (parfum) are all common skin irritants for rosacea.\n\nIn general, rosaceans are encouraged to use products containing lipid-restoring ingredients, such as cholesterol and ceramides. **Examples of recommended products:**\n\n**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**\n\n>Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 20, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Phytosphingosine, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum_\n\n**Paula's Choice MOISTURE BOOST Hydrating Treatment Cream**\n\n>Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Ethylhexyl Stearate (texture enhancer), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil (emollient plant oil), Butylene Glycol (texture enhancer), Glycerin (skin-replenishing ingredient), Petrolatum (emollient), Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/ Hexacaprate, Tridecyl Trimellitate (texture enhancers), Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide 3, Cholesterol (skin-replenishing ingredients),Tocopherol (Vitamin E/antioxidant) Squalane (emollient), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (stabilized Vitamin C/antioxidant), Dimethicone (texture enhancer), Niacinamide (Vitamin B3/skin-restoring ingredient) Polysorbate 60 (texture enhancer), Hydrolyzed Jojoba Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein (skin conditioning agents), Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract (soothing agent), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin-restoring ingredient), Whey Protein (water-binding agent), Tridecyl Stearate, Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Phenyl Trimethicone, Myristyl Myristate (texture enhancers), Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Decarboxy Carnosine HCI (skin-restoring ingredients), Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture enhancers/water-binding agents),Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax (texture enhancers/emollients), Aminomethyl Propanol (pH-adjustor), Disodium EDTA (chelating agent), Benzoic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Sorbic Acid, Phenoxyethanol (all preservatives)._\n\nIn short, avoid harsh skin care regimes that contain astringent (stripping) toners, abrasives (such as washclothes or cleansing tools like the Clarisonic), and sensory stimulants (menthol, camphor, and other things that \"tingle\").\n\nThis proper care and grooming preps the skin for treatments. One study I read literally called it \"priming the skin.\" This is because once set into motion, the inflammatory reaction of rosacea is a domino effect that makes any topicals (either prescription treatments or basic skincare) even more challenging. Rosacean skin is incredibly delicate, and even once seemingly under control, the dominoes can begin to fall once you add products that were once too irritating.\n\nFor example, when I first began treating my rosacea, I could not use anything outside of my basic moisturizer. Years into treatment, I have begun to experiment. Every now and then though, I get cocky and try to introduce something to my routine too quickly after playing with harsher products, such as when I tried to use ialuset so shortly after using a BHA. My skin lit up and felt like it was on fire.\n\nThis is common with rosacea, and is called \"status cosmeticus\" (cosmetic intolerance syndrome).\n\nPriming the skin -- aka giving it time to rest and recover -- mitigates the risk of this occurring.\n\nWhen skin is this flared up, it is recommended to wait before applying even the most bland of moisturizers. In some cases, delaying up to 30 minutes may be necessary. This reduces risk of irritation. Once tolerability improves, you can reduce the wait time by 5 minutes per week until you are able to moisturize right after cleansing.\n\n#### **Sunscreens**\n\nSun exposure plays a large part in the erythema of rosacea, particularly in ETR, and was cited as the number one trigger for redness and flushing by the NRS. For this reason, it is incredibly important to wear sunscreen or a hat daily. [I've done a larger post on sunscreens that you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8kbgvs/research_evaluating_your_routine_sunscreens/).\n\nIn general, zinc oxide sunscreens seem to do well with rosaceans due to the soothing effects of the zinc. Zinc oxide can be a bit drying though, so wear a moisturizer underneath if it feels uncomfortable.\n\nOrganic sunscreens (chemical filters) may cause stinging and irritation, particularly if the skin is more sensitized or irritable.\n\n### **Prescription Topicals**\n\nPrescription topicals have become more and more common for treating rosacea, especially when considering the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance (though some oral medications, like Oracea, have shown promise due to the lower prescribing level it is prescribed at, and is typically prescribed in combination with topicals for treating PPR).\n\n#### Metronidazole\n\nMetronidazole is known under the brand names MetroGel, MetroLotion, and MetroCream. It has been well-studied and has impressive results at killing some of the microbes that are considered responsible for rosacea.\n\n#### Azelaic Acid\n\nApproved by the FDA in 2002, azelaic acid (AzA, brand names Finacea and Azelex) is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate ETR or PPR in concentrations of 15-20%. It is a dicarboxylic acid, and usually sits at a higher range of the pH scale (4.8-5). This is potentially what makes it less irritating.‚Å∑ In one study, it was shown to be potentially as effective as metronidazole, but tolerated much better by patients.\n\nIt should also be noted that in another study involving AzA (15%), waiting until after moisturizing to apply AzA resulted in greater penetration of the AzA. This did not occur with all moisturizers however, and was only seen in moisturizers that lacked large amounts of occlusives.\n\nIt should also be noted that in a small study, gluconolactone (PHA) was shown to be helpful when combined with Azelaic Acid 15%.\n\nAzelaic acid can be found in some over-the-counter products and in mixtures from [Curology](https://curology.com/) (US only, 4%+).\n\n#### Rhofade (Oxymetazoline Hydrochloride)\n\nRhofade is an extremely new topical for treating the redness that is characteristic of rosacea. The mechanism of action is vasoconstriction -- quite literally meaning it constricts the blood vessels involved in rosacea.\n\nIt was approved by the FDA in January 2017 and became available for prescription in May 2017. Unfortunately, it's so new that I can't find a ton of literature on it that wasn't part of the initial literature and studies submitted to the FDA for approval.\n\nHowever, according to the last study submitted by the parent company to the FDA for approval: \"The FDA‚Äôs approval was based on data from two identical randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies involving a total of 885 patients with moderate or severe disease who were treated with oxymetazoline cream or vehicle. In study 1, the proportions of patients with reduced erythema at hours 3, 6, 9, and 12 on day 29 were 12%, 16%, 18%, and 15%, respectively, for oxymetazoline cream (n = 222) compared with 6%, 8%, 6%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 218). In study 2, the corresponding values were 14%, 13%, 16%, and 12% for oxymetazoline cream (n = 224) compared with 7%, 5%, 9%, and 6% for vehicle (n = 221).\"¬π¬π \n\n#### Brimonidine Gel \nApproved by the FDA in 2013, Brimonidine gel (brand name Mirvaso) was one of the first topicals approved for vasoconstriction. \n\nUnfortunately, it can cause severe rebound erythema if it does not do well with you.\n\n#### Retinoids and Adapalene\n\nFor sufferers of PPR, tretinoin (such as brand names Renova and Retin-A) as well as adapalene (brand name Differin) may be an option. In a small study of 25 patients with mild to severe PPR who were treated with .05% tretinoin, 80% had complete or excellent resolution of their papules and pustules, with only one patient showing no improvement. In 40% of patients, it also resulted in a resolution of their visible blood vessels.¬π¬≤ It is thought that tretinoin's ability to suppress inflammation may be a factor in this.¬π¬≥ \n\nIn some patients with rosacea, tretinoin may be very difficult to incorporate into their routine due to the irritation that tretinoin can cause. For these people, adapalene (Differin) may be a gentler option.\n\n#### Other Combinations\n\nSome doctors can also prescribe combination ingredients that may be more commonplace for acne sufferers, but can work in some PPR. These combinations usually include benzoyl peroxide (BP) and erythromycin.\n\n### Other Ingredients\n\n#### Niacinamide\n\nThere have also been small studies that show the benefits of niacinamide in PPR‚Å∏, though anecdotal evidence seems to be that the higher the percentage of niacinamide, the greater chance of reactivity. You can find niacinamide serums that are made to be added into products. **Some examples:**\n\n**The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%**\n\n>Ingredients: _Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin._\n\n**Paula's Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster**\n\n>Ingredients: _Water (Aqua), Niacinamide (vitamin B3, skin-restoring ), Acetyl Glucosamine (skin replenishing/antioxidant), Ascorbyl Glucoside (vitamin C/antioxidant), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (skin-soothing), Glycerin (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Glycyrrhiza Glabra Root Extract (licorice extract/skin-soothing), Ubiquinone (antioxidant), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Beta-Glucan (skin-soothing/antioxidant), Panthenol (skin replenishing), Carnosine (antioxidant), Genistein (antioxidant), Citric Acid (pH balancing), Sodium Citrate (pH balancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)._\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nIn my experience, vitamin C - a powerful antioxidant - may also prove to be tricky for rosaceans. I've never been able to successfully use vitamin C for long periods on my skin, though some rosaceans may find success with it.\n\nThere are many derivatives of vitamin C. Refer to table 5 below.\n\n|TABLE 5. Derivatives of Vitamin C|\n|--- |\n|Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|THD|\n|Ascorbyl Glucoside|\n|Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate|\n|Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid|\n|L-Ascorbic Acid|\n\n\nL-Ascrobic Acid (L-AA) and Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid (EL-AA) are the most irritating forms of vitamin C. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate is typically considered the most gentle and recommended for sensitive skin types.\n\n#### Salicylic Acid\n\nSalicylic acid (BHA) is usually recommended to rosaceans over AHA due to it's anti-inflammatory properties (it is related to asprin and both are salicylates). This means that it can reduce redness and swelling. Conclusive evidence of it's efficacy with rosacea is lacking, but it can work for some. When shopping for a product, you'll want to find a BHA product without alcohol or menthol.\n\n#### Natural Oils\n\nIn anecdotal cases, natural plant oil can benefit rosacean skin, particularly rosacean skin that is troubled by many moisturizer ingredients.\n\nIn my case, I do better with oils that are high in linoleic acid and low in oleic acid. Knowing how your skin does with one oil may guide you in choosing the next. Refer to table 6 below for more information on linoleic vs oleic content in common oils.\n\n\n**TABLE 6. Linoleic vs Oleic Content in Common Skincare Oils**\n\nOIL | LINOLEIC % | OLEIC %\n---|---|----\nMineral Oil | 0 | 0\nGrapeseed | 73 | 16\nFlaxseed | 67 | 20\n|Sunflower|62|25|\n|Hemp|55|11|\n|Rosehip|48|14|\n|Sesame|42|42|\n|Rice Bran|39|43|\n|Argan|37|43|\n|Apricot Oil|29|58|\n|Sweet Almond|24|62|\n|Hazelnut|12|79|\n|Neem|10|40|\n|Olive|10|70|\n|Coconut|2|60|\n|Jojoba|0|10|\n\n#### Licorice\n\nLicorice root and licorice extract are both considered skin brighteners due to their ability to inhibit or slow melanin synthesis, but it can also be very soothing and anti-inflammatory.\n\n#### Green Tea\n\nGreen tea (Camellia Sinensis Polyphenol) is an increasingly common anti-inflammatory and soothing ingredient. It stars in many anti-inflammatory serums and moisturizers, such as the Replenix Power of Three products.\n\n#### Snail Mucin Extract\n\nCollected from happy snails (snails are not harmed for the collection of their mucus and are usually fed diets of organic greens), purified snail mucus is more common in Asian beauty products, but has already shown promise for wound healing and may have anti-inflammatory properties for some people. It is the star in many KBeauty favorites, such as CosRX Snail Mucin Extract. Not all rosaceans respond to snail mucin extract, but some (particularly with PPR) find it to be nearly magical.\n\n#### Propolis\n\nAnother rising star in the Asian beauty world, propolis or \"bee glue\" is a mixture of bee saliva and beeswax. It can be very soothing and similarly to honey, anti-bacterial.\n\n#### Aloe Vera\n\nAloe is renown for its ability to soothe and heal. It is found (at least in part) in every post-sun product you can get your hands on, and may have been recommended to you by a family member to slather on a wound, directly out of the stem of the plant. It can be extremely soothing to both ETR and PPR rosacea. It also may contain some humectant (water-binding) qualities and helps with wound healing.\n\n#### Tranexamic Acid\n\nWhile I do not know much about tranexamic acid, in a small study of 30 rosacean patients over two weeks, involving 3% tranexamic acid, it was shown to improve the skin barrier.‚Åπ According to Paula's Choice ingredient dictionary, tranexamic acid is a \"synthetic amino acid that functions as a skin-conditioning agent and astringent. Research has shown that amounts of 3% can work as well as gold standard skin-lightening ingredient hydroquinone for discolorations; however, hydroquinone has considerably more research attesting to its effectiveness. Other research has looked at skin improvements from tranexamic acid via administration by microneedling.\"¬π‚Å∞ It seems to be more common in Asian beauty products, such as [UNT EX WHITE LASERWAVE](https://www.shopunt.com/en/skincare/serum/ex-white-laserwave/p/2198/) (also contains mandelic acid, a mild hydroxy acid).\n\n#### Hydroxy Acids (Glycolic, Lactic, Mandelic)\n\nHydroxy acids are tricky for rosacea. In virtually every study I read, lactic acid preparations in 5-10% were used for sting tests in rosaceans (from above: In a study involving 7 ETR patients and 25 PPR patients, 100% of ETR patients responded positively to a \"sting test\" [discomfort, flush, stinging sensations] of 5% lactic acid, while 68% PPR patients responded potively. Only 19% of the control group responded in the same manner). The permeability barrier dysfunction, characterized by an increase in TWEL, is an integral feature of rosacea and would explain why hydroxy acids are so tricky for rosaceans. \n\nMandelic acid seems to be the acid of choice for most rosaceans who can use hydroxy acid at all, but only once skin has stabilized over the course of a couple of months and not immediately following other treatments. If you find that you cannot use hydroxy acids at all without redness and discomfort, you are not the only one.\n\nMy more complete write-up on hydroxy acids can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8l5gx5/research_evaluating_your_routine_hydroxy_acids/). \n\n*Note: Azelaic acid is not a hydroxy acid, despite being in my initial write-up linked. I included it due to it's name, which can create confusion for some, and realized I probably just created more confusion around it unintentionally. I'm sorry about that, guys.*\n\n* * *\n\n## **Laser and Light Treatments**\n\nWhile it is one of the more expensive ways to treat rosacea, it can be highly effective and very helpful for stubborn cases.\n\nThe most common laser and light treatments for rosacea are pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and light-emitting devices (IPL or Intense Pulsed Light), though CO2 lasers are used for thickened skin.\n\nWhile not a laser, IPL helps to break down the structures in the skin that cause redness. The output is broad spectrum, and can be modified.\n\nPDL is more intense, and aims light at blood vessels beneath the skin. This light is then converted to heat, absorbed by abnormal vessels, which destroys the vessels without damaging the surrounding skin. This can cause bruising, and is usually recommended for severe cases.\n\n* * *\n\nHopefully this post has been helpful to many people. Do you have rosacea? Let me know what has helped you!\n\n## **Sources**\n\n1.

    "body": "To me, price tag doesnt matter. Its whats INSIDE that matters. and i feel like i see a lot of people ignore the ingredients of their skincare and are getting scammed. on both the low dollar tree end and and the high end.\n\nNow i am not one to be scared of anything with a scientific name like Hydrogen oxide or call everything 'Chemicals'. But if a product claims to have a certain ingredient and its the LAST thing on the list under even fragrance and preservatives, i have questions. Or for what ingredients they claim to have they then package improperly like Vitamin C and Retinal in clear bottles.\n\nSome brands at the DT have proven time and time again to just not use enough of an active they claim they have in a product and its just a waste of my $1.25 (im looking at you BOLERO) while others have shockingly good ingredients like skin nutrition botanicals.\n\nAs a long time DT lover, this newer brand BPure is giving me Bolero vibes with some of their products, and thats an insult.... For example the new glow up serums. I took a look at the ingredients and they just dont line up with the claims on the package.\n\nHere are the ingredients for the strawberry one:\n\nWATER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PEG/PPG-17/6 COPOLYMER, POLYSORBATE 80, HYDROXYACETOPHENONE, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, CARBOMER, SODIUM ACRYLATE/SODIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYL TAURATE COPOLYMER, PHENOXYETHANOL, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, ISOHEXADEC- ANE, NIACINAMIDE, CAPRYLHY-DROXAMIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, DISODIUM EDTA. FRAGRANCE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE. SALICYLIC ACID, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM. LINALOOL, FRAGARIA ANANASSA (STRAWBERRY) FRUIT EXTRACT, CITRIC ACID, CARMINE (CI 75470)\n\nThis claims to have AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) and just just does not. it has citric acid which is technically an AHA, but its at the end of the list and in that amount is not doing anything. and the strawberry extract can be considered a 'natural aha' but again, thats not the claims and its so low it wont work like an AHA.\n\nHaving most the actives listed under fragrance means its likely under 1%. The Salicylic acid has to be like 1-2% to work. At MOST this serum is hydrating. but a very basic hydration at that. Which isnt bad, but not what it claims at ALL.\n\nBut then there are brands like skin nutrition and their claims on their products and the ingredients are actually shocking. The actives they claim are there in their true form (not like the AHA lie in the last one). They have correct percentages (and often TELL YOU the % for a lot of things). While they might not be the most life changing product, based on formula alone, they weirdly outclass a lot of brands and their claims for $1.25\n\nWhile i enjoy trying all the new products that come out, when i see items like the BPure strawberry smoothing serum, i get frustrated. They clearly can make and sell quality products like skin nutrition. It feels like they have started to pump out poor performing products that probably have a better profit margin since they dont contain very much of the more expensive ingredients and its \"just a $1.25\" so people scoop them all up since its viral.\n\nIs anyone else seeing this with recent launches? And BPure has put out some great products too, but they are so hit or miss with their claims and how they line up with whats in them. Just because i shop at DT doesnt mean i want to over consume. and i know its easy to just try everything, but it adds up. \n\nwhat viral DT beauty products have you noticed like this? what are your thought on this? Do you just trust what the product is claiming? What are your thoughts?\n\n",

        "body": "Buying DT beauty/skincare is  an option for those who enjoy frequently trying new products, love to experiment, and prefer an inexpensive/budget shopping experience. Over the years I have tried some DT products but have left behind most I had initially considered.  Because after checking the ingredient list, I have concluded that many  products simply won‚Äôt meet my needs. Fragrance, niacinamide, floral/fruit extracts are a no. Instead I stick to the OG skincare/haircare/cosmetic products that have never disappointed and I know work for my skin.  I just buy these on sale, stack my coupons, use store promotions and CVS ExtraBucks to restock the products I have already learned work best. For example, a bar of Vanicream soap might be as low as $4 after coupons and promotions. A Maybelline mascara might cost $5. That‚Äôs the same cost as four DT products at the current 1.25 price point.  Sure, I could buy 4 DT mascaras for that same $5, but they likely won‚Äôt be as effective or as consistent as a Maybelline product. However, if I saw my favorite Maybelline mascara at DT I would certainly buy at least two!\n\nWe can choose how to consume and we can all become smarter consumers. If an active ingredient is dead last or very far down the list, there‚Äôs a good chance that ingredient has such a low percentage that it will not produce appreciable results.\n\nAn educated DT consumer is a happier consumer. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "body": "I agree with a lot of what you have said. I think that those specific watermelon, strawberry, Avocado, etc. bpure serums are sort of useless and definitely unnecessary. Not Worth even your $1.25. And so I totally agree with that. \n\nI also agree that there are definitely products that don't have amounts of ingredients that are even going to be effective just like you said. That being said, I think a lot of people hear \"Dollar Tree\" and think, there's no way there's anything good in there or anything in an amount that's effective, which just isn't necessarily true at all. And so I'm glad that you also mentioned a couple brands that are doing good things cause I actually think there are several brands that have extremely effective combinations additionally. \n\nOne thing I thought would be important to point out for those who aren't as adept at ingredient list reading, It isn't always just about how high up in the ingredient list the ingredient is. Some things just have to come in very small percentages for the best situation for your skin. People think they want retinol to be the second ingredient, but we don't usually want like a huge percentage of retinol or something else. AND sometimes a large amount of retinol isn't even helpful if it's not actually being delivered into the skin with proper mechanisms. So an amount of retinol or Vitamin C or whatever underneath 1% could still be effective depending on the situation. \n\nThe whole vitamin C thing is super complicated as well because there's different types of vitamin C that require different percentages to be effective. And also it's just a not a very stable ingredient and so there's a lot of confusion there. \n\nHowever, that being said, I don't think we should write off all clear bottles that have what we consider sun sensitive ingredients like retinol. Studies have shown that while some ingredients prone to deteriorating in sunlight, that is specific to sunlight and not just like the light within the store or within the warehouse. And so in actuality, most of the product is not going to be exposed to very much sunlight at all because it would be made in a factory, stored in boxes, transported in boxes. And then stored in the store until you take it home. And then you have to decide where you're going to put it. It probably experiences minimal deterioration in such circumstances. So saying oh the retinol etcetera in this product is completely ineffective because it's in a clear bottle is over-simplistic and negating a lot of the good. \n\nOverall I agree with you but I just wanted to add some of my thoughts.",

This post I wanted to make good on my promise to do a more complete list of rosacea cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen recommendations. \n\nThis list may also be valuable to people who find they have sensitive to very sensitive and reactive skin. It has been compiled with the help of personal experience, MakeupAlley Skin Boards, SCA, and AB. **As always, please feel free to post the kinds of products that have worked for you.**\n\n_This list is by no means a be-all, end-all but is merely a place to start. Also worth noting is that I am not affiliated with any brand listed below._\n\n* * *\n\nCleansers\n=========\n\nIn my last post, I mentioned that there are two types of cleansers that are generally recommended for rosaceans: lipid-free cleansers (also known as creamy cleansers) as well as syndet cleasers (synthetic soaps -- usually low-foaming cleansers). True soaps, such as saponified soaps (Dr. Bronners, handmade soaps, glycerin bars, etc.), have a higher pH -- somewhere around 9-10 -- and are not recommended for rosacea. Antibacterial soaps should also be avoided due to their tendency to kill much-needed \"good\" bacteria on the skin. \n\nI have highlighted ingredients that may be problematic for some rosaceans: propylene glycol, fragrance, benzyl alcohol, and urea.\n\nCreamy Cleansers\n----------------\n\n**CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (Best)**\n\n>_Ingredients: Purified Water, Glycerin, Behentrimonium

        "body": "Moisturizers\n============\n\nHydration is essential for the functioning of skin, but especially skin that struggles to hold onto moisture, such as rosacean skin. Depending on your skin type, you may need a heavier or lighter cream. I've tried to give you several options for each category. The important thing with your moisturizer (since it will be sitting on your skin the longest) is to look for lipids that can repair the moisture barrier (such as ceramides), occlusives that will keep moisture in (such as¬†caprylic/capric triglycerides, dimethicone, or oils), and ideally antioxidants that will soothe redness (such as¬†green tea [camellia sinensis polyphenols]). \n\nPlease keep in mind that some ingredients may still bother you, despite them not being highlighted in these listings.

    "body": "Here is the routine that my skin has come to make peace with since the last 8 months after years of perfunctory experiments it endured. I have also incorporated the  **Be Minimalist's AA & TXA serums since 20/02/2021**  into my routine,so they are being reviewed here while the CTM+sunscreen products have gained my trust enough to be holy grail(s)! \n[You can fill yourself in regarding my skin type and concerns by reading this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/lmjcxq/look_what_arrived_in_the_mail_today_upcoming_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and consider the routine to be nothing greater than anecdotal evidence :)\n\nPS: The length of the post might make it look like I accidently published a scientific paper on the Internet but I have compensated for that by using the 'üê≥' emoji as pointers because nothing emotes joy like a whale mindlessly sprouting water into the ocean :P\n\nüîπ **MORNING ROUTINE** üîπ\n\nüê≥ Cleanser:  **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel**\n\n   \n   üê≥Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   üê≥Serum: **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%**\n   \n\n   üê≥Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night             Repair**\n\n\n   üê≥Moisturizer:  **Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**\n   \n\n    üê≥Sunscreen :  **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++**\n\n\n\nüîπ **NIGHT ROUTINE** üîπ\n\n    \n   üê≥Cleanser :  **Cera Ve Salicylic Acid Cleanser**\n\n   \n  üê≥Toner:  **DermaFique All Important Skin Toner**\n\n\n   üê≥Serum:  **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA**\n\n\n   üê≥Serum:  **Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair**\n\n    \n    üê≥Moisturizer:  **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion**\n\n    \n    üê≥Replaying that moment when I called my class teacher 'mummy' in the 7th grade before wrapping up the day is a cult ritual.\n\n\n\n\nüîµ **CLEANSER** üîµ\n\nüîπ **Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Cocoglucoside, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Chloride, Ceteareth-60 Myristyl Glycol, Glycol Palmitate, Glycerin, Peg-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Propylele Glycol, Sorbic Acid, Disodium Edta, Fragrance, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract.\n\nüê≥ **Application** : Just like how *normal* people apply a face wash. Normal is the operative word here because ain't nobody washing their face like actors in a commercial,that's clearly abnormal.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : This was recommended by my dermat after a bout of eczema 2 years back and I absolutely swear by it. It's gentle,glides like a dream and doesn't make you feel taut. My ideal cleanser traits  basically match my romantic relationship requirements oof.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't**  : You can't rely solely on this to remove every last trace of makeup. Using an exfoliating tool like a silicone device or a microfiber cloth and or a cleansing balm along with it will help gun the gunk.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Aderma Soothing Foaming Gel](https://www.1mg.com/otc/a-derma-soothing-foaming-gel-otc124930?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=DKI-Campaign&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLcOw8t8kA-n8aJRIp5QbrKPNE7fv3NzWAnvxQTAvn2VFpxhN8yawlRoC_KMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aqua/Water/Eau, Cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, Glycerin, Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, Niacinamide, gluconolactone, peg-150 pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Zea mays oil/corn oil, Ceramide np, Ceramide ap, Ceramide eop, Carbomer, calcium Gluconate, Sodium chloride, Salicylic acid, Sodium benzoate, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, Cholecalciferol, Cholesterol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium edta, Tetrasodium edta, Hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Phytosphingosine, Xanthan gum, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I use this 3 times a week as a masque that I leave on for a minute and then rinse it off.Continued application of SA tends to make the skin dry and extra sensitive so tailor the application to your skin's capacity.\n\nüê≥ **What works** :I learnt it the hard way that regular mask usage coupled with overactive sweat glands is a recipe for bumpy,textured skin. \nThis one has been gentle in sloughing off the dirt and dead cells while not damaging my skin barrier because exfoliating products are kinda infamous for that.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : Procuring the product can be a hassle.The price is exorbitant(I paid INR2500 for the 237ml one). The purging is real.The first two applications,where in I used it like how I would use a normal face wash,made my face go red and sting and I did wake up to whiteheads around my perioral region the next morning. I was determined to make it work because I broke the bank for this one,so after hours of ‚ú® *manifestion* ‚ú® and some amount of patience(read: spacing out the time b/w applications and using the tiniest bit of product and building the amount therafter),the reactions completely stopped after the second week. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : Cera Ve hasn't hit the Indian market yet but there are ample Instagram Stores which get them procured. [I brought mine from this one.](https://instagram.com/_vivanka_chennai?igshid=5brie36vc4w2)\n\n\n\nüîµ **TONER** üîµ\n\nüîπ **DermaFique All Important Toner** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I got this transferred into a mist spray bottle because I quite enjoy the feeling of being spring irrigated. So two pumps of *sphrsh sprsh* right after washing my face is just about the right quantity to dampen the skin adequately.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : It's devoid of alcohols and boasts of skin hydrating elements with Panthenol being on top of the composition. \nThe toning is quite prominent w/o making your skin feel tight and serves as a good base to apply makeup over too.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The fragrance can be an issue if you are susceptible to fragrance induced allergies/sensitivity. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Dermafique All Important Skin Toner](https://www.nykaa.com/dermafique-all-important-skin-toner-150ml/p/305497?gclid=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE&ptype=product&skuId=305497&ef_id=CjwKCAjw3pWDBhB3EiwAV1c5rDj9L8cs6K47zwVlmidQJpyzgkuxfRltUqZ_cU7kCr0Gz9w6kPEWrRoC8ucQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!599!3!383869122205!!!u!294680686006!&utm_source=GooglePaid&utm_medium=PLA&utm_campaign=PLA_FULLSITE_GOALOPTIMISED)\n\n\n\nüîµ **SERUM** üîµ\n\nüîπ **Be Minimalist's Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA 1%** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aloe Vera Juice, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Alpha Arbutin, Propanediol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Phenoxyethanol, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sclerotium Gum, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Lecithin\n\nüê≥ **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto my face (‚ö†Ô∏èensure the dropper doesn't touch your face‚ö†Ô∏è) and then I pat it into my skin as  rubbing motions causes the product to coagulate into a milky residue.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : The product claims to reduce your susceptibility to dark spots and it seems to deliver what it promises. My skin is prone to developing a freckle or two because apparently it believes we have red head ancestry running in my genes but mostly also because I tend to unintentionally slack with my sunscreen usage at times. I was 10 days into my usage of this product when I happened to go on a trip where I was constantly out in the sun w/o sun protection(don't come at me pls,it was a genuine oversight) and I had prepared myself to witness the birth of a freckle sooner or later. It's been 2 months now since the trip and I haven't seen any sun spot trying to make an appearance. I have also developed a liking to the consistency for it's ease of application and how the absorption leaves the skin feeling supple. \n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : I haven't found any sore point with this product so far.\n**Zero.Zip.Zilch.Nada!** This is definitely a product I WRP. \n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's AA](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2-hyaluronic-acid-1?variant=36542370480289&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBUIZNQNn0pGaiw-7c3hh-ezEGZfU57ewJnSZz6ISmO9xr2KRT06LhoCLDsQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **Be Minimalist Tranexamic Acid 3% + HPA** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Aqua, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Tranexamic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Mandelic Acid, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Acetyl Glucosamine, Hydroxyphenoxy Propionic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ethoxydiglycol, Salicylic Acid, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Sclerotium Gum, Pullulan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Extract, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\nüê≥ **Application** : 2-3 drops from the dropper onto the skin and then pat pat pat.\n\nüê≥ **What works** : The brand claims that this potion will banish all sorts of pigmentation (PIH,PIE,MELASMA). It most definitely does work on recently formed pigmentation left behind by a zit or sun exposure. I had a mark of approximately 4 weeks left by an angry zit and 2 weeks of application of this serum lightened it drastically(if left by itself,a mark will atleast take 6-8 months to completely fade away for my skin). The serum also comprises of Mandelic Acid which is known to tranquilize irritated skin and I was curious to know if it would help in the event of an irritation occuring. Much to my skin's displeasure but to my pleasant surprise,I did have an episode of my skin flaring up one fine day and I put the serum to test. And boy,did it help. The redness subsided within 20 minutes and in another hours time my skin no longer felt like it was on fire. \nAlso,I did do a patch test for both the Be Minimalist serums and there was no adverse  reactions that I encountered during the initial use. \n\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The consistency of the product is a bit eh. It's too runny and thin,causing it to spill outside the dropper without one having to actually squeeze the dropper to use it. Also,the serum has a yellow tint because of turmeric being one of the ingredients and it does impart a yellow hue after application. So the product can vex you out,if like me you've butterfingers and are olive skinned and decide to wear a white shirt while applying this. The most coherent brickbat I have for this product is it's inefficiency (so far) to work it's magic on my perioral hyperpigmentation. I haven't seen any difference in that aspect  after 6 weeks of continued usage of this serum. I will give it the benefit of doubt because the pigmentation has been in it's doing since a decade now and for the product to work from the get go it has to be a voodoo potion,which it certainly is not. So,I probably will try one more application cycle by repurchasing the serum once I'm done with this one,but I'm kinda on the fence if this does work with stubborn melasma.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Be Minimalist's TXA](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa?variant=37671264059553&currency=INR&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRBLPMvouTxxjv1v6SZbi9Ma7lWWebK34NVom0eNXdNUBU8aqTtzvORoCMaIQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîπ **Estee Lauder Advanced Night repair** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Water\\Aqua\\Eau, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Peg-8, Propanediol, Bis-Peg-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, Methyl Gluceth-20, Glycereth-26, Peg-75, Butylene Glycol, Adansonia Digitata Seed Extract, Tripeptide-32, Sodium Hyaluronate, Yeast Extract\\Faex\\Extrait De Levure, Lactobacillus Ferment, Cola Acuminata (Kola) Seed Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Hydrolyzed Algin, Pantethine, Caffeine, Lecithin, Sodium Rna, Bisabolol, Squalane, Glycerin, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Caprylyl Glycol, Oleth-3, Oleth-5, Choleth-24, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Jojoba Wax Peg-120 Esters, Ceteth-24, Tocopheryl Acetate, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Tetrasodium Edta, Bht, Xanthan Gum, Potassium Sorbate, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Red 4 (Ci 14700), Yellow 5 (Ci 19140).\n\nüê≥ **Application** : The same process as for the 2 serums before. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : ' *I'm just a girl,standing infront of the mirror,asking my skin to look hydrated* '. The ANR is my cheat code to making my skin look like I drink my water, moisturize frequently and mind my own business;none of which I actually do. The consistency is quite dense but it gets absorbed into the skin like a dream.\nThis along with the Alpha Arbutin makes my skin glow visibly and I have had my mom point that out to me so many times that I'm beginning to think she is an obsessive fan~\nPost application,it makes your skin feel plump and well taken care of.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The first 3 weeks of application caused my skin to become bumpy in the areas where I usually experience  purging reactions (the cheeks). I knew the ANR was to be blamed for it because as soon as I stopped using it,the textured skin  would stop.The USP of the ANR is that it utilizes fermented ingredients so I arrived at the conclusion that my skin is walking down the path to fungal acne and I should stop at my tracks. There was a brief period that lasted approximately 2 months of not using the ANR.And then one fine day on a whim,I decided to start using it again. And this time around,it didn't give me any reaction of any sort. I have no idea how it started working but I do believe in the presence of a higher power that day forward. Secondly,the price point.It is ridiculously expensive. I had this gifted to me and I wouldn't have brought this for myself in any lifetime. The 75 ml one lasted me one whole year with regular application,which is just in time for me to shamelessly ask them to regift it to me. \nIf you really do want to try skincare with fermented ingredients,you can look for products containing galactomyces or get yourself friends who love you enough to splurge on you :P\n \nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Estee Lauder ANR](https://nykaa.ly/P_833278)\n\n\n\nüîµ **MOISTURIZER** üîµ\n\nüîπ**Bonsoul Pure Natural Aloe Vera Gel**üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : 99% Aloe Vera Juice;¬†Xanthun Gum, Aqua and Malic Acid\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I take half a dollop of the gel and massage it onto my skin in circular motions. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : It's scent free and doesn't have the ogre hue most packaged aloe vera gels have. The consistency is similar to that of a pure aloe sap barring the stickiness. It is able to lock in the toner+ serum induced hydration for a good 7-8 hours. Aloe Vera for my skin is what lemon juice is to a hangover. Not just my SOS remedy,but also an ingredient my skin thoroughly enjoys otherwise. Its a great humectant so for once the sky rocketing humidity level of Bombay is a boon. \n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : In the recent past,I had spent a few years up north where the air is dry,which made my skin go from combination to dehydrated to dry. In an attempt to salvage my skin,I aggressively slapped on the gel whenever I could and it led to more damage because turns out,humectants like aloe draw water into them and lack of moisture around you causes it to suck water from your skin cells. In my opinion and demonstrated experience,it is preferable to ditch the use of humectants if your geographical location or your idolence doesn't allow constant external  hydra-replishment to your skin.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Bonsoul Aloe Vera Gel](https://www.amazon.in/BONSOUL-Aloe-Vera-Hair-Face/dp/B0799H82MY)\n\n\n\nüîπ **Cetaphil Dam Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Water, Glycerin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cetearyl Alcohol, Macadamia Integrifolia Seed Oil (Macadamia Nut Oil), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Cyclopentasiloxane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Polyacrylate, Phenoxyethanol, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Ceteareth-20, Stearoxytrimethylsilane, Stearyl Alcohol, Benzyl Alcohol, Farnesol, Sodium PCA, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Dimethiconol, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I take a pea size amount of the product and work it onto my face by dabbing it in. \n\nüê≥ **What works** : I have tried a handful of face moisturizers before and they made me look like I had dunked my face in a bowl of oil + gave me chicken skin ,until I chanced upon this one.The sheen is tolerable,the feel is hydrating w/o the heaviness and it retains the moisture upto 10-12 hrs while the consistency is lightweight.\n\nüê≥ **What doesn't** : The presence of shea butter and macadamia oil makes the product slip slightly into the occlusive sphere which doesn't quite make it summer+ sweat friendly,which is why it has secured a spot in my night time routine.\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Cetaphil Dam Lotion](https://m.netmeds.com/prescriptions/cetaphil-dam-lotion-100gm?source_attribution=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_source=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=ADW-CPC-Shoppingadsnew&gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy-EwmVNUJwzGSdc0VrKlUDd2SNQ9mLAsXolqiGo9vyDgjxk4iPR1aRoCQEMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\nüîµ **SUNSCREEN** üîµ\n\nüîπ **Bello Photostable SPF 40+ PA+++** üîπ\n\nüê≥ **Ingredient List** : Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Uvinul Mc 80) (7.5%), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol (Tinosorb M) (5.0%), Ethylhexyl Triazone (Uvinul T 150) (3.0%), Bis- Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine (Tinosorb 8) (2.8%), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (Uvinul A Plus Granular) (2.5%)\nInactive Ingredients: Purified Water, Dimethicone, Trimethylsiloxysilicate, Cetearyl Alcohol\n\nüê≥ **Application** : I find the 2 finger application to work well for my skin type.\n\nüê≥ **What work's** : It's a chemical sunscreen so it doesn't make one appear like a Victorian ghost. The finish is an ideal amount of dewy. It takes 5-10 minutes to completely settle into the skin which is not a collosal downtime. The application of makeup over this is smooth,there is no piling if it has been allowed to absorb completely. I had encountered flare ups with continued use of a few sunscreens before,which is something I absolutely didn't with this one.\n\nüê≥ **What doesnt** : After a few disappointing experiences which almost pushed me to the brink of sun protection abstinence,I consider the Photostable to be an utopian paradigm of sunscreen composition which basically is a more literary way of saying I am a simp for this one. I am a pilot by profession and get burnt to toast on a regular basis so this has been put to test in the most extreme environment one could think of and it does pass the criterion with *flying colors* (I tried,but I couldn't stop myself from using the phrase :P )\n\nüê≥ **Look it up here** : [Bello PhotoStable SPF 40](https://pharmeasy.in/online-medicine-order/photostable-spf-40-tube-of-75gm-gel-25694?gclid=CjwKCAjwjbCDBhAwEiwAiudBy_aQyihAHDf9p6kuYoooOk1gxcQrSUF2UWtJvydzPpGmbHBjJbQSIRoCjrMQAvD_BwE)\n\n\n If you did stick until the end,thank you!

But ever since getting some high end Western skin care as gifts, I noticed that many of them actually have a lot of fermented/yeasty ingredients in them.\n\nBut I can't find much on the \\~science\\~ or evidence behind why ferments can be good for your skin. But I also wonder, since ferments aren't really a thing that majority of consumers in the Western market are looking out for (like fragrance, rose water, coconut water, rosehip oil, fruit/veggie extracts that have label/experience appeal, but aren't necessarily good for skin), why would these huge companies bother putting ferments in their expensive skin care if they didn't have evidence that they do SOMETHING?\n\nI especially am curious because AB/Korean beauty are sometimes looked down upon as just being trendy and not using ingredients that are scientifically proven to be truly beneficial for skin.\n\nDo you think ferments are legit?

Fermenting antioxidant rich ingredients such as ginseng, green tea etc. breaks down the antioxidants/complex molecules that are beneficial to our skin into smaller molecules, which allows it to be absorbed into the skin easily. Not only that, yeast/bacteria ferments produce additional metabolites (AHAs, peptides) that provide additional benefits such as whitening, hydration, skin repair, you name it!\n\nEdit: forgot to put my favorite fermented product!! I love the Manyo Factory Galactomyces Niacin Special treatment. :) \n\n2nd Edit: here are the links to some scientific literature articles on fermented cosmetics which were found through PubMed!

I'm interested in trying it but would like to hear other people's feedback on it before I spend the money.",

    "body": "\nHey all! üëãüèªI want to review hair growth serum from minimalist-\n\nSo i have straight fine hair(little below shoulder length)(30s/F), oily scalp. \n\nI have been suffering from hair loss for past two years. I haven't checked with my derm. I have lost some hair (in patches) because of my tight hairstyle. Then came humidity season and my hair were everywhere. Before taking an appointment I decided to try hair serum. I started on 29th june. \n\n\n29/6: Started with serum. First application was hassle free. No burning or warming of the scalp. I used 4 drops front of scalp(problem area) and 4 drops back of my head, everyday, in the AM(as i take shower in the PM). Rubbed into my fingers and then Massaged only on my scalp and not on length. It was non greasy.\n\n\n01/07: In just two days I started to feel my hair fall is less, like 3-4 strands in my comb. I thought its a placebo effect.\n\n\nI continued it for two weeks straight, every day and my hair fall reduced by 20%. I stopped the application on 14/7 for two weeks as i was traveling and wanted to see if hairfall return and to my luck it Did. But it wasn't alot. I think some people miss understand that after stopping hairfall doubles but it's just the same amount you used to get(at least for me)\nI restarted again and still using it and now i can say I definitely see hair looks bit thicker, have seen baby hair growth especially at the hairline and hair fall has reduced to 80%. \n\nI will keep using it as it dint have any side effects except one stubborn cc which always occurs on my forehead if apply regularly. Thus i now use it 4-5 times a week(depends on which day i ll shampoo and workout)\n\nIts non greasy if applied less but if you directly use the dropper on scalp you might end up using alot and it will give oily look. My scalp normally gets oily on 3rd day but with everyday application of serum hair looks oily on 2nd day. \n\n\nPROS: 1. It works.\n2. New hair growth. \n3. Hair seem thicker.\n4. Less hairfall.\n\n\nCONS: 1.Everyday application is a task for long hair and oily scalp as you need to shampoo.\n2. Give cc on forehead with regular use.\n3. Don't think its a permanent cure.\n4. Expensive.\n\nInci:\nButylene Glycol, Aqua, Dextran, Acetyl Tetrapeptide-3, Trifolium Pratense (Clover) Flower Extract, Propanediol, Arginine, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Sodium Benzoate, Gluconolactone, Calcium Gluconate, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Apigenin, Oleanolic Acid, Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Sprout Extract, Isomalt, Sodium Metabisulfite, Larix Europaea Wood Extract, Glycine, Zinc Chloride, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Saccharide Isomerate, Sanguisorba Officinalis Root Extract, Serenoa Serrulata (Saw Palmetto) Fruit Extract, Capryloyl Glycine, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Lactic Acid\n\n\nTL:DR- True to its claims, will repurchase it!\n------------------------------",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Apart from some Neutrogena products and No7 Beautiful Skin Blemish Defence Serum, they contain \"alcohol denat.\", which is a dealbreaker for me as I try to avoid drying alcohols as much as I can. \n\nBHAs are few and very far in between, in addition to not being labelled as such and most probably without the percentage of salicylic acid contained or whether it's in the right pH to be effective. \n\nI haven't done a price comparison, and since I found them in Boots I've used the online site's price point. Prices are only as a guide, they may be cheaper/more expensive elsewhere.

Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"‚Åµ* *In the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.*\n\n*Another study* *show**ed* *that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.‚Å∂*\n\n*More notes: First study comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D.*\n\nHiyas!\n\nMany of you love Kiku's High Moist, so I picked it up the last time I went to my local Murakai market in SoCal so I could try it out and figure out what all the hype was about.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***\\*\\*,\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extrac\\*\\*\\*\\*t)\\**, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most. While I could not find any clinical dermatology studies done on sake as a ferment in skin, we may be able to glean some understanding into the benefits of sake by examining both ferments and koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¬π*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of¬†saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"¬≤ Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom this break down, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, and whitening properties, though it is important to keep in mind that there are no studies that I could find into the benefits of sake when applied topically, so this is all assumptions based on the chemical makeup.\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein. Derived from animal placenta ([in this case, horse](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5fgonk/psa_kikumasamune_does_not_use_ingredient_derived/)), it is considered to be a safe ingredient that does not deliver any metabolic or endocrine activity. Again though, there was not much precedent that I could find on the benefits of including this ingredient specifically, however egg whites have been used for centuries on skin to make skin temporarily feel tighter and appear smoother.\n\n*Fun fact: Umbilical extract has precedent for unrestricted use in Japan, except for certain products.¬≥*\n\nFinally, we arrive at the stars of this product: arbutin and licorice root extract. Arbutin, an ingredient primarily used for it's antioxidant properties as well as skin bleaching. It is a¬†natural hydroquinone, derived synthetically or from bearberry plants. Once on the skin, it converts into hydroquinone and acts as a tyrosinase inhibitor. While not as effective as hydroquinone, it lacks the concerns of hydroquinone thus has become more popular in recent years.\n\nLicorice root extract is similarly a tyrosinase inhibitor as well as an anti-irritant - with some studies signalling that it may be able to absorb UVA and UVB rays. It is more effective than kojic acid and some studies put it at 75x more effective than ascorbic acid ([though Dr Dray raises some interesting points regarding the efficacy of L-AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JxO6sVMJzM)). \"The chief constituent of licorice root is glycyrrhizin, present in concentrations that range from 5 to 24 percent depending on the variety of licorice used.\"¬≤\n\n# My Experience\n\n**My skin type:** Rosacean, acne-prone and extremely irritation-prone\n\nFirstly, the pump on my bottle broke off rather spectacularly when my bottle took a tumble from my tiny bathroom counter top. I'm not sure why this product comes with a pump applicator in the first place, as it frequently would dispense more product than I needed, which I suppose is fine as I was able to spread it down my neck and chest, but it was still was a bit of a shock to get a whole handful of it on the first pump. This experience doesn't seem limited to me, so I really recommend decanting this product into a better dispenser if you can, like a spritz top bottle.\n\nPackaging aside, the first time I used the High Moist lotion, I was pretty nervous. It's a very runny product, sharing a consistency with water, and if you've read my blog at all you know that I am a fairly dry-skinned lady. To my surprise and delight though, it was¬†*uber* moisturizing. I applied it fresh out of the shower, in place of my HadaLabo Premium, and instantly my skin just felt soft and supple. I imagine much of this is due to the placenta protein filling in the gaps of the skin cells and creating a \"smooth\" texture as well as the ceramides, which tend to plump up my skin and make it feel softer.\n\nThe fragrance was also so mild that frankly, the smell of sake overpowered it. Thankfully this smell seemed to dissipate after a few minutes of application, and my rosacea did not flare up from the inclusion of fragrance. Over the next few days, I used the High Moist in place of my HadaLabo, and then began to combine it at night with the HadaLabo Premium on top. It worked well with oils and other moisturizing products on top - no pilling or strange film to report.\n\nIn two weeks, my skin looked brighter and felt smoother, though none of my dark spots had faded. Unfortunately, like most products with ferments, it began to break me out after this time. The good news though is that it doesn't appear to break me out¬†immediately, unlike every other ferment, and the smoothness lasted for a few days after I discontinued use, which means I may try to use it sparingly once my skin heals.\n\n# Sources\n\n1.

The new Reddit's editor is a damn mess and I am constantly cleaning its crummy markdown.\n\nHi, SCA.\n\nSomeone requested more reviews and breakdowns, so I figured I would post this here. I originally posted it in r/AsianBeauty where I got some excellent feedback and thoughts.\n\nThis is a bit of a review slash ingredient breakdown, so I hope you enjoy!\n\n\\---\n\n>*Full Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol ,* ***Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake)****, Glutamic Acid, Arginine, Leucine,* ***Ceramide 3***, ***Ceramide 6***, ***Placental Protein***, ***Arbutin***,***Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (Licorice Root Extract)****, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Protein, Maltitol, Methyl Gluceth-10, Peg-6 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Styrene/Acrylates Copolymer, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Fragrance.*\n\nI've highlighted the ingredients that are worth discussing a bit in detail.\n\n# Ingredient Breakdown\n\nSake is a fermented product made from [rice](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/01/sake-rice-how-sake-is-made-rice-varieties-brewing-sake.html), [water](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-school-the-importance-of-water-in-sake-making-where-does-sake-come-from.html), [koji](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/koji-the-miracle-mold-how-sake-is-made.html), and [yeast](https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/02/sake-yeast-temperature-yeast-strains.html). Ferments have been all the rage recently, with *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (living yeast) extract and *Saccharomyces ferment* being the two I see the most.\n\nA couple of studies on sake (specifically rice wine and sake extract) showed multiple benefits. One in vitro (meaning in a dish or tube) study showed that rice wine increased  \"the expression of procollagen and laminin-5,\"‚Å¥ which is one of the key components in the intercellular makeup of the layer that holds the epidermis to the dermis. Additionally, \"laminin 5 also accelerates the assembly of basement membranes and may enhance the recovery of damaged skin.\"‚ÅµIn the same study, experiments were done on hairless mice (in vivo) and showed that topical application protected the mouse from photo-aging.\n\nAnother study showed \\*that sake extract inhibited tyrosinase, both in vivo (in a living organism) and in vitro, though it is unclear how many subjects were involved based on the abstract alone.‚Å∂\n\nIt's important to note that the first study I mentioned comes from Doosan Group R&D, which seems primarily interested in vehicles, construction, electrical, etc., while the second study was paid for by AMOREPACIFIC R&D - a popular skincare company.\n\nWhile these studies are minimal, we may be able to glean some deeper understanding into the benefits of sake by examining two of the most popular (and more studied) ferments as well as koji (kojic acid) itself.\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast used for brewing beer. In one study, saccharomyces cerevisiae extract (SCE) was studied in several formulations. One contained SCE, and/or vitamins A, C, and E, and was patch-tested on the back of volunteers. The subjects were then tested for transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin moisture (SM), skin microrelief (SMR), and free radical protection in 3 hour, 15 days, and 30 day intervals.\n\n>*\"Our results suggest that vitamins and SCE showed effects in \\[skin moisture\\] SM and \\[skin microrelief\\] SMR. Only formulations containing SC had long term effects in the improvement of SMR. Thus, these kinds of evaluations are very important in cosmetics development to evaluate the best risk and benefit correlation.\"¬π*\n\nAnother fungi ferment, saccharomyces ferment, has similar benefits. It is obtained through the fermentation of¬†saccharomyces - a genus of fungi that is known as the baker's yeast - in the presence of metal ions. The yeast is credited with promoting good skin condition and is frequently found in products that reduce redness.\n\nThe other half of sake worth discussing, koji (kojic acid) is a skin-lightening agent and antioxidant. It is a tyrosinase (an enzyme that controls the production of melanin) inhibitor, but not as effective as other tyrosinase inhibitors like licorice extract. \"In combination with allantoin and other proper ingredients in sunscreen preparations, the mixture can inhibit UV-caused erythema and accelerate wound healing.\"¬≤ Unfortunately, it can also be sensitizing to some skin and create irritation.\n\nFrom all of this, we can assume that sake contains some sort of very mild exfoliating, humectant, anti-aging, and whitening properties, but the studies are fairly minimal thus far. To add, it is important to remember that not all skin ingredients penetrate deeper than the first few layers of the stratum corneum (the upper-most layer of the epidermis, what we see with our eyes), so long-term studies in vivo over many years tend to be the most reliable (hence why your doctor may be more apt to prescribe you tretinoin \\[Retin-A\\] than a newer drug).\n\nThe next ingredients on the list are ceramides 3 and 6. If you've been following my writings, you already know that ceramides are naturally found in the skin and help maintain the skin barrier. In fact, our skin's natural lipids are 35-40&#37; ceramides.\n\nSlightly more exciting is placental protein.

You can make \"banchan\" (side dish) with them, a bunch layered on top of each other drowned in soy sauce mix, or a spicy version with red pepper powder and garlic and such. Sometimes it's used as a wrap for meat. It's thick and kinda hairy feeling if you eat it fresh/raw.

    "body": "Since I was testing and re-testing so many products this year, and I really wanted to give myself time to evaluate them I decided to wait until the end of the year to compile a series of mini-reviews on my purchases this year. I'm open to answering questions and giving in-depth reviews if needed as well, feel free to ask about anything you see listed here! \n\n\n**Products Currently in Use (as of January 14th, 2017):**\n\n\n* **Aquasmart Shower Filter** - *Hands down the best purchase I have made all year*. The filter was installed in November, and my skin feels amazing. It's so good at purifying the water from the shower that I wash my face exclusively in the shower now. All my products foam better, rinse cleaner, and leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated. No more sore, dry, itchy patches. The ingrown hairs on my arms have also cleared up, and my hair feels less brittle and dry than it did. I don't think I'd have cut my products back as much as I have this year without this filter in my life. Worth the $34.99.\n\n* **Kiku-Masamune Skin Care Cleansing Gel** - Smells pleasantly like sake with a hint of bubble gum. Other reviews I've read talk about it not being an effective makeup remover, but I can't speak to that as I don't wear makeup. It's lovely in the morning/evening though as a little pick-me-up and it leaves my skin hydrated and soft. The sake smell evaporates quickly and it *seems* to be evening the tone of my skin as well. \n\n* **Innisfree Broccoli Clearing Gel Cleanser** - I use this once a month. It smells musty and earthy. It does dry my skin out a little, but it's loaded with salicylic acids so it's to be expected. A thicker gel, it bubbles very well when I apply it and rinses cleanly as well. Generally I use it when I see a few more spots pushing their way through, which is sometimes the week before or the week after my period.\n\n* **Innisfree Jeju Bija Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel** - I use this in the evenings as well/instead of the Kiku-Masamune Cleanser, depending on how my skin feels. Less salicylic acid than the Broccoli Cleanser, but still refreshing. ETA: Still available on Testerkorea, seems to only be discontinued on the innisfreeworld website.\n\n* **Kuramoto Bijin Hakumai Ferment Milk** - This. I've thought so many times over the past couple of years that I had found a product that worked. Green Tea Seed Serums, Green Tea Essences, Green Tea Gel Creams.... nope. Nay. Never. They felt good, but all came with problems. One had alcohol, the others all had Castor Oil. The gel cream dried down to much on my skin, making me feel \"less dry\" but my skin still felt tight. I didn't realize what I was missing out on until I was in Japan this year (At the Tokyu Hands inside the Takashimaya by Shinjuku Station, for reference), where I'd been directed to find this product that checked out ingredients-wise. It wasn't until I got back home that I gave it a shot, and since then I think I finally feel what everyone talks about when they say \"My skin is hydrated/bouncy/soft/healthy.\" I've used the words Holy Grail far too easily in the past. I am halfway through my first bottle, glad I purchased a second and I will be loading up on another 3 or 4 once my Christmas bills are paid off. Holy Grail? I think I'm getting closer. Faintly scented with sake (less than Kiku's for reference), liquidy creamy consistency. Very lovely to put on, and as it's somewhat of an AIO, I don't feel the need to add more product on top of it.\n\n* **Momohime Peach Gel Cream** - Purchased on a whim at Don Quijote in Shinsaibashi Osaka, I still thought \"gel creams\" would work for me. This product managed to change my thinking on what a \"gel cream\" should be, and how the right ones can work for my skin. It has more of the consistency of a cream, but it \"peaks\" in the jar like a gel. I dab some on my face at night and let it sink in by itself. Afterwards my skin does not feel dry or tight like it has with other clear gels in the past, and it smells delightfully of peaches for a brief period of time. It's also free of my major irritants, like alcohol and castor oil.\n\n* **Nivea Happy Time Peach Hand Lotion** (body only) - One of my favourite random purchases from my first trip to Japan. I can never buy enough bottles, and I can never find an online supplier either. :( Still, one of the best handcreams I've ever used and if anyone in Japan wants to swap some western products for a few of these bottles, I'm your girl!\n\n* **Kiku-Masamune High Moist Lotion** (body only) - Ingredients list checked out! Got home, opened it up, applied it to my face... and broke out the next day. This was the product that got me to add \"Hydrogenated Castor Oil\" to my list of Skincare Nopes. While I'm sad to say that it didn't have the effect on my skin that I wanted, the rest of my body (and my poor boyfriend's rough hands!) are more than happy to take one for the team! I layer this underneath a heavier lotion now, since winters (-28 Celsius with the windchill in my city right now) dry out my skin like cod on the beach during a Cape Breton Summertime. I used it on my feet too, which were cracking and peeling really badly. I MAY repurchase this as an all over body lotion.\n\n* **Kiku-Masamune Skin Care Essence** (body only) - So, after the breakout from the High Moist (and rechecking ALL the ingredients for triggers) I decided I wasn't going to take the risk with this one. It's been relegated to hand/body use and I don't regret it. Another possible repurchase as the year goes on. Still has the famous Kiku-Sake smell, but I quite like it personally.\n\n* **COW Brand Red Box Beauty Bar** (body only) - Remember how I said that shower filter was the sole saviour for my skin? I brought back three bars of this soap and I'm certain it's been doing it's fair share of the work as well. I generally use a locally produced, naturally sourced soap for my skin, but even when the new filter went on I was still fighting with cracked heels and dry patches on random parts of my body. So, I busted out the COW even though I'd thought it wasn't going to do anything special. I wanted to try something different for soap, just to see if my beloved Rocky Mountain Soap was the culprit. Surprise! (It wouldn't be on the list if it hadn't worked!) **Fair warning, this soap is very highly fragranced.** I like it, but others could be overpowered or put off by the smell. This is another item I will happily trade for!\n\n\n**Products I Have Used Over The Past Year That Are Still Being Evaluated Or I Will NOT Repurchase:**\n\n\n* **Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Essence** - Lovely ingredients list, but didn't seem to do a whole lot for my skin. I will probably use it up for the sake of argument, but I don't see myself adding it back into my routine right now.\n\n* **Innisfree Jeju Lava Seawater Skin** - Contains Castor Oil. Hydrating, but it did give me small breakouts on my cheeks. Too bad because I love the texture and the scent. (Think Froot Loops by the beach.)\n\n* **Innisfree Minimum Toner** - Free of everything. Loved it, but I needed to move into products that did more for my skin. This is a very good jumping off point if you are sensitive or dehydrated and you do not want to overwhelm your skin.\n\n* **Innisfree Minimum Ampoule** Essence - Same as above. Does a good job keeping your hydrating products in your skin. Protip: Keep the bottle after you're done if you want to have a vacuum pump bottle for dispensing other products.\n\n* **Innisfree Minimum Cleanser** - This is a foaming cleanser with a very high PH. Eats away at my skin even though it's intended for sensitive skin. I would not recommend it if you are dehydrated either. Good for cleaning jewelry, and brushes though.\n\n* **Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel** - Contains Castor Oil. I has a huge sad about this product because it's SO GOOD, but I break out if I use it more than a few days in a row, or if I go for double application. Not good news when it's a sunscreen.\n\n* **SANA Honeyshca Cleansing Gel** - Contains, yep, Castor Oil. Started testing this in Japan, and while I love the honey floral scent, it clogged my pores and gave me a HUGE ingrown pimple on my chin. Nooope. May repurpose as a handwash.\n\n* **Ceracolla Perfect Gel** - Still very back and forth on this. I find more and more that almost anything labelled \"gel\" dries my skin. And the Ceracolla checks out otherwise, so while using it I don't notice a huge difference I do need to muck around with it a bit more to see if layering another product on top will take a way the tight, dry feeling after I apply it. I tend to use this at night, so the ceramides and other good junk can work their magic.\n\n* **Mediental Snail Collagen Aquaring Gel** - Contains Alcohol. Bought this at a Winners in Canada as a \"Oh hell, why not. Snails AND Collagen? SCORE!\". Nope nope nope nope. I can't even use it on my legs because of how drying it is.\n\n* **Nursery Yuzu Makeup and UV Cleansing Gel** - At first I was quite excited about this. I was testing it at the same time that I was using other products that were all later found to have Castor Oil in them, so I may give this one last shot, just to use it up. I do like the fresh citrusy smell though, and maybe once summer hits I'll start testing it more at night. Please note, the use of UV in the title means it can remove sunscreen from your face.\n\n* **Kuramoto Bijin Komeyu Oil** - Too sticky for my skin, but I do like a few drops applied to my curly hair. Fair warning, if you use too much you'll go from \"glossy curls\" to \"Little Richard\". I will have to evaluate further a time goes on.\n\n* **Mizu No Tenshi Skin Treatment Gel** - Another drying gel. This was being used strictly at night because of the whitening effect (extra care needed if you use it during the day as it increases the sensitivity of your skin to UV), I may re-evaluate in the same manner as the Ceracolla.\n\n* **Nexcare Acne Dressing** - Used too many before I realized that you need to pop the pimple in order to drain it properly. I can't find them easily locally so I'll probably switch products instead of repurchasing this one.\n\n* **Isehan Sunkiller Perfect Strong Moisture** - I tested this at the same time as the Canmake, and thought it was also contributing to my breakout problem. I'll give it another shot soon, and hopefully it won't be a drag on my skin.\n\n\n**Products That Are Discontinued:**\n\n\n* **Innisfree Soybean Energy Essence Light** - Contains Castor Oil. I din't notice much of a lightening, tightening effect, but I did notice once I stopped using it my acne basically went away. Castor Oil! -shakes fist at the sky-\n\n* **Innisfree Apple Juicy Cleansing Oil** - Sold this to another AB'er earlier this year. Smelled really good, didn't do a damn thing for me. Lovingly re-homed.\n\n\n**Products I Look Forward To Testing:**\n\n\n* **DR 119 Amazing Spiderman Pore Mask** - Impulse purchase from TK, they look fun but I will probably only use it once.\n\n* **The SAEM Bamboo Gel** - The sample I tried worked wonderfully when I was in Las Vegas on Vacation and I got a sunburn. Since aloe seems to be changing status in terms of hydrating and protecting the skin, I figured I'd give bamboo a shot.\n\n* **Kuramoto Bijin Rice Ferment Soap** - My 2017 Goals are to smell like a walking sake brewery. I feel like my skin is gonna love this stuff.\n\n* **Kuramoto Bijin Face Lotion** - Sake Filtrate! Sake! Sake Lees! Get on my face!\n\n* **rinRen Rose & Tsubaki Treatment** - I'm still really waffling on this. I brought back some samples from Japan, and while the shampoo wasn't anything special, the Treatment is loaded with oils. The downside, it also has alcohol. Made my hair feel good, but... we'll see.\n\n* **Sunscreen TBD** - I have a new brand in mind, the Dr Ci:Labo UV Gel and the Sensitive Milk are on my list. If the Isehan Sunkiller strikes out again, I'll be testing this as soon as I can. \n\n\n2017 is hopefully my year for hydrated, bouncy, healthy, happy skin! Sake is looking more and more promising as a decent hydrator, and I am seeing a definite change in the tone and texture of my skin since I started using it. Kampai!",

I'm heading back up to read the rest of your post because I love how detailed it is- that's just what somebody told me when I mentioned it was DC'ed. Hopefully someone can chime in with a source for the info :)",

Nearly every day. Like, I've actually dreamed about it. It's weird, I know...\n\nThe only solution I can see is to move to Japan, buy 50-75 bottles and bathe in it daily until my ardor cools.

Parachute discontinued this product soon after and I was heart broken, so were my friends who became equally obsessed. BUT, they brought it back, my boyfriend discovered it for me and I immediately asked a friend of mine to get it from India (I am currently residing in UK). I was very excited to try it, the texture is same as the previous product but they have definitely changed the formulation. The scent is also very different from the discontinued product.\n\nThe new formulation is amazing and this has become my holy grail again. I would repurchase it in a heartbeat, ive struggled with fungal acne and this product is the only thing that helps me. i love it SO MUCH. it really is the best fucking product and i am so happy it is back. I will be loyal to this till the end of my life. Although, i feel the new formulation is inferior to the old one but only marginally.\n\nThis product is very cheap too, always on sale on myntra and is available everywhere, last time people struggled to find it.

    "body": "In my opinion the only way ascorbic acid may potentially work topically is when it's used fresh, and applied at night in the absence of UV exposure. Personally I don't believe in preformulated water based ascorbic acid products. Even when it's fresh the amount of studies that prove that vitamin c really works topically is quite limited. Vitamin c penetrates skin rather poorly. There simply is no standardization to prove the effectiveness of a specific formula, unlike sunscreens and retinoic acid. Shelf life is no indication of the stability of actives and doesn't say anything about it's stability on skin. Ascorbic acid is simply notoriously unstable, it's more likely to degrade on skin and be irritating. From all the research available today, the best efficient way to get ascorbic acid in skin is to just take it orally.\n\nBeneficial actives in bold, potential irritants in italic/stripethrough\n\n**Water based products**: below pH3.5 the ionic charge of AA is removed ([ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605218/)), improving skin penetration and stability, but water based products remain extremely unstable ([ref](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/7291637/stability-of-vitamin-c-derivatives-in-solution-and-topical-formulations/3),[ref](https://skinelegance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CSBM_-Skincare-theories-busted-Dec-2014.pdf)), most companies don't store their product in fridges in warehouses, it isn't unlikely products are severely oxidized by the time they arrive at your home\n\n* [‚Ç¨18/50mL - Skinlex 20%](https://www.skinlex.com/product/20-vitamin-c-serum-30ml/)\n  * **pH:** 3-3.3\n  * **Pros:** simple irritant free formula, right pH, pump is convenient compared to pipet, light serum, inexpensive\n  * **Cons:**  pump is not airless, concentration other actives unknown, instability, the look and feel of website and adress of company make me doubt if it's really formulated by a well educated cosmetic chemist\n  * **INCI:** Water, **20% L-Ascorbic Acid**, Butylene Glycol, **Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Allantoin**, *Triethanolamine*, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol.\n\n* [‚Ç¨28/50mL - SkinPep C15](https://skinpep.com/super-c15-serum/)\n * **pH:** 4.3\n  * **Pros:** Great blend of actives, light serum, shared concentrations\n  * **Cons:** pH is too high, dropper, instability, incorrect ingredient order (Propylene Glycol)\n  * **INCI:** Aqua, **15% l- Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-3, Panthenol**, Hydrolyzed Collagen, **1% Alpha Tocopherol, 0.5% Ferulic Acid**, Glycerin , *Triethanolamine*, Phenoxyethanol, *2% Propylene Glycol*, Ethoxydiglycol, Laureth-23\n\n* [‚Ç¨34/50mL -Wishtrend 21.5 Advanced Serum](http://www.wishtrend.com/skin-care/1215-pure-vitamin-c215-advanced-serum-by-wishtrend.html)\n * **pH:** unknown\n  * **Pros:** Simple irritant free formula\n  * **Cons:** concentration is a bit high, dropper bottle, lack of stabilizers, not many actives \n  * **INCI:** Hippophae Rhamnoides Water (70%), **Ascorbic Acid** (21.5%), Sodium Lactate, 1,2-Hexanediol, **Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol**, Cassia Obtusifolia Seed Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Ethyl Hexanediol\n\n* [‚Ç¨41.60/50mL - SkinActives 15%](http://www.skinactives.com/Vitamin-C-Serum-Ascorbic-Acid-L.html)\n * **pH:** 1.5-2.5\n  * **Pros:** Airless pump!, great blend of actives, not very expensive, no propylene glycol, ph is low enough for penetration, skinactives is busy with a reformulation without the citrus extracts.\n  * **Cons:** ph is irritating, according skinactives not suited for daily use, lack of stabilizers like water reducing agents, recrystalizes quickly.

I've been debating with myself wether to put this on the good or bad list. In my opinion there are a lot of uncertainties about the stability of diy formulas, especially if you start mixing it through existing products. Even destilled water contains impurities that will react with ascorbic Acid, and many people don't use water reducing agents, or stabilizers like propyl gallate, sodium metabisulfite, chelators etc. A low pH, vitamin E, Ferulic acid help of course, but I don't think many people really understand the exact chemical reactions going on and don't have analyzers like they do in labs, so how certain can you be about your own creation. Most often DIY formulas also just recrystallize on skin. Formulating an ascorbic acid serum really is difficult, it is more than just dissolving some ingredients in water. Dissolving in TO Ferulic Acid will be difficult since maximum solubility in Propanediol is just 5%, in contrast to 33% in water. The key here is to make it fresh every 1-3 days I guess.\n  * [‚Ç¨5.80/20g TO Powder](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-100pct-l-ascorbic-acid-powder-20g?redir=1)\n  * [‚Ç¨89 /20mL Philosophy Turbo C booster](https://www.sephora.com/product/turbo-booster-c-powder-P204606)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Anhydrous formulas**: best stability, but not much research on penetration\n\n* [‚Ç¨9.60/50mL - The Ordinary C23](http://theordinary.com/product/rdn-vitamin-c-suspension-23pct-ha-spheres-2pct-30ml?redir=1)\n  * **Pros:** Cheap, anhydrous (stable), together with TO Ferulic+Resveratrol a very affordable good combo\n  * **Cons:** No other actives,  no vitamin E, relatively unpleasant texture, stinging, for me too thick/greasy for daytime use.

It doesn't use a dropper, I have a bottle and it's an airless pump.\n____\n\nAlso about The Ordinary, I have information about its penetration ability if you'd like:\n\n\nA quote from Brandon Truaxe:\n> In these formulations, either the VC is suspended as powder in silicone bases (so no water) or the powder is actually supplied separately. If suspended, the majority of the VC is trapped within the silicone that is applied on the surface and only a small % will come into contact with the skin. Of this %, a maximum of about 33% can dissolve within the water content of the skin to be used and so from a 20% VC formula, 5% maybe exposed to the skin and 33% of 5% which is less than 2% is actually potentially used. If the VC is supplied as a separate powder to be mixed, there are two issues: a) powder weighs far less than water by volume and cannot be measured in ml as supplied. To achieve a 10% formula, you would need to fill your palm with VC powder and add liquid which means most such products would last less than 1 few days; b) the oxidation begins at the time of mixing anyway; its just less oxidation since the mixing occurs at a late stage.\n\nThat means that with TO Vit C 23%, your skin is only using about 2%, while L-AA's max absorption rate is 20%.",

    "body": "[Find the album here!](http://imgur.com/a/2up5h)\n\nHi AB! I uploaded these pictures a long time ago, about 2 weeks after my first haul, with the idea that I would use the products for six months and then post reviews. Any swatches were also taken at that same time. Six months are up, so I hope my info will help you make better decisions for your skin, body and in turn, your bank account. I will give my thoughts on the product, then leave it a rating out of 5 on the general feel, price and finally, my personal rating (not reflective of the previous ratings). Every link is non-affiliate and I'm posting this on my own accord. The only product that won't be reviewed is the Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cotton Fit Samples, as they were a gift.\n\nAdmittedly, as I'm re-reading this I clearly see things I could have done to make this more coherent and easier for you all to understand, but it's a lot of writing and I learned as I went along. I felt like some gossip magazine columnist towards the end, so I'm 100% sorry if that's cringey or off-putting. If I do another review set in future, I hope it'll be better written.\nGoing in order from the photos:\n\n\n*SKIN CARE*\n\n\n**Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_dbe8149455.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-original-skin-energy-hyaluronic-acid-100-30ml.html?search=mizon%20100)\nThis feels similar to Hada Labo original but it's a super small bottle, only 30 ml compared to HL's 170 ml. Way longer ingredient list as well, but my skin swallowed it. It has ceramides and cholesterol, peptide, anti-inflammatory and -aging plant extracts, and adenosine as well as the titular hyaluronic acid (listed as sodium hyaluronate). On RRS it's listed at $10 USD, a 76% discount from $40 USD. I forgot about this when I bought a different hyaluronic acid serum and then pushed it back even more once I got Hada Labo. Turned to it last month when I felt like my skin just couldn't hold moisture, and I don't think I'll go back. It has not broken me out, and I use it right after my BHA/AHA.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>this feels so good to apply. I want to say it smells very, very faintly like some kind of butter/fatty oil? lmao it's not a bad smell at all, it's almost floral. The texture is super slippy and thin, again, like Hada Labo lotion. After application, my face is soft and smooth. It's like my face sucked the stuff into it within a minute.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$9.77 for 30 ml. for what this serum does, less than 10 bucks for 30 ml is an absolute steal. God bless RoseRoseShop.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>I love it. So dearly, I love it. I'll definitely be repurchasing this once I buy from RRS again, and while I'm hesitant to call out holy grails, this is probably mine for moisturizing.\n\n----------\n\n**Tosowoong Syn-Ake Natural Pure Essence** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2dc0196695.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/tosowoong-syn-ake-natural-pure-essence-100ml.html)\nThis was good. It's main purpose seems to be anti-aging. Nothing I remember as truly remarkable, but that might be because I'm barely an adult and thus don't really have any fine lines to speak of. Funnily enough, I don't see anything resembling syn-ake in the ingredients. I still ended up buying this because it has a pretty good-looking formula, which it even touts on the box. Fourth ingredient is niacinamide, and other stars include two different ferments, peptide, centella extract, betaine, hyaluronic acid, and many berry extracts. Despite how unwowed I might seem, I ended up using this up within the 6 months I had it. I suspect it's effects are similar to my Missha FTE Intensive, as in lightened PIH, evened tone/less redness and general lack of irritation. It took a while to see these effects, but because this was used in conjunction with so many new products with brightening ingredients I'm not 100% sure it was the culprit.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Liquidy and clear, smells like nothing. Spreads like any other serum, no complaints here.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$11.80 for 100 ml.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>For me personally, it just doesn't do much. I don‚Äôt have any age reversal to see, and even if it did help with my skin tone, I have other products that I know for sure do that. All in all, it's a solid \"good\" from me. If anybody out there with more mature skin and/or fine lines has used this product, please let me know what it did for you!\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Intensive Skin Barrier Serum**\n[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_38f5180403.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-intensive-skin-barrier-serum-50ml.html?search=Mizon%20Intensive%20Skin%20Barrier%20Serum)\nThis did nothing for me. When I ordered this haul, I had sickly dry winter skin and was desperate for moisture, so what better product than something with \"skin barrier\" right in the name? Turns out, this was hell in a pump. I didn't check the ingredients and was left with a serum that might as well have been smelly pimple slime. I had closed comedones all along my jaw and cheeks, my skin was dry again a few hours after application and the smell made me feel a little sick every time i used it. I've not experienced this with any other AB product. This is more of a testament to using CosDNA zealously than anything else. My bad. To my confusion, the first time I tried to use the pump applicator it wouldn't work. On the bottom of the container, there is a removable cap-looking thing with a notch on the edge that I used to pry it off and fiddle with the stopper that helped to push the product up. Only then was I able to use the pump.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Nothing special. Slightly opaque, classic serum consistency. The smell of this is citrusy and reminds me of cheap candles. I'm not one to mind fragrances, but it makes me feel like I need to drink a glass of water and lie down.\n\nprice: 2/5\n>$15.61 for 50 ml, list price is ~$25. Even discounting my personal experience with it, this serum is unimpressive for being one of the more expensive items in this haul. The major ingredients seem to be all filler with a few extracts and some HA tossed in as an afterthought.\n\npersonal rating: 1/5\n>Would not recommend. I have since chucked the bottle, I can‚Äôt even use it as a body treatment or hand cream it smells so bad.\n\n----------\n\n**Enprani Dear By Moistfull Booskin** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_0868211750.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/dear-by-moistfull-booskin)\nI don't really understand this product. It's a very acclaimed toner, which is why I bought it, and I do like it for days when I wear makeup but it puzzles me. My skin never felt dry after using it, but it never felt moisturized either. When I used this before serums, emulsions, creams, etc. it did help them to sink in faster, but over the day my skin felt slightly more parched than usual. I think this helped me to realize that I am really not a toner person. It's typical for me to skip that step most days now, but I do use this when I wear foundation or bb creams/cushions and it does help them wear longer. If you wear makeup often, I would definitely recommend this.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Water consistency but with a texture that's like less-stringy snail slime or joseon cream? Yes! Feels good to put on. The smell is strong, like flowery fabric softener. I'm told it's rose scented but I don't know what rose smells like. It dries down to what I would call a matte finish and feeling. Points lost for the eventual dryness and strong smell.\n\nprice: 4.5/5\n>List price now on Memebox is $20 for 120 ml, but I think I paid $18 for this? Regardless, I've used this toner for 6 months and I'm probably only down 20 ml. Worth the investment if it works for you.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>As far as toner goes, I think this will be my go-to forever for makeup prep. I love the smell and the feel, and if I didn't have combination skin, I think this would be perfect. I would recommend this to those with oily skin.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f37d220631.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-snail-recovery-gel-cream-45ml.html)\nIt's okay, however I much prefer my Cosrx Snail Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence over this. It did help with my acne scars at the time and it's WAY cheaper than cosrx, so I would never be overly harsh on it. I notice some peptides and plant extracts at the bottom of the ingredients, so that's neat. I think this is a good cream for those who want to dip their toes in the pool of snail products without investment. This was my very first haul, after all, and this cream was my gateway to snail. I use this for my legs and other body parts and have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Cool and jello-y without the messy stringiness of pure snail. Slightly opaque with an earthly cosmetic smell. Dries like a dream.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.20 for 45 ml, a total steal.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>Overall, I just have a better snail cream that I prefer over this one. Would still repurchase this as a cheap snail body cream since it's a blessing for ingrown hairs.\n\n----------\n\n**OST C20 Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e7e3205117.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/o-s-t-c20-original-pure-vitamin-c20-serum-30ml.html?search=c20)\nThis stuff stung like a quick slap to the face every time I used it, but I'm told that's normal. It smells like sharp orange juice and is thick and sticky. It dries like that too, feels like a second skin and not in a good way. It oxidized super fast in the 4 month period that I used it. I stored it in a dark place and in fairly low temperatures. I did like the effects it left me with: a more uniform texture, lightened dark spots, a not-quite-oily-but-definitely-not-matte glow However, the hassle surrounding vit c is too much for me to deal with every day, especially for only 4 months of use.\n\nfeel: 2/5\n>Real, real gross. Very pungent citrus scent. On your skin, it feels kind of like what evaporated sea salt looks like if you feel me. I have to wipe off residue by applying my next step with a cotton pad.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$11.23 for 30 ml. Not terrible, by far. I'm sure that if you use this serum very diligently you'll be able to use it up before it's the color of maple syrup.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>It's okay. I know that vitamin c isn't supposed to be hydrating or even comfortable, but I feel like there are better, more stable formulas out there, and when people on the sub circlejerk about how unstable this stuff really is, they aren't kidding. If I were to try vitamin c again, I would not repurchase this product.\n\n\n*MAKEUP*\n\n\n**Etude House Precious Mineral BB Cream Cover & Bright Fit in W02 Light Beige** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_2571201744.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/etude-house-precious-mineral-bb-cream-cover-and-bright-fit-35g-spf30-pa.html?search=Etude%20House%20Precious%20Mineral%20BB%20Cream)\nAND\n**Holika Holika Nabi Cream SPF 25 PA++ in Cottony** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e6f1197705.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60408&search=holika+nabi)\nTo be up front, I don't wear makeup very often and I have very little to compare this to. My skin's texture is fairly even, but I find my complexion is sallow with dots of PIH here and there, plus the discoloration of faint freckles. Have some [swatches](https://m.imgur.com/a/J0xdx) in artificial light, flash and natural light. Left to right is just primer, then just bb, then bb on top of primer blended out. \nThis will be a bit longer of a review. I used this in conjunction with the Holika Holika Nabi Cream, so I will group these together. I really like this bb cream and primer. They work well together, do not break me out and the color matches me nicely. It looks quite orange at first, but paired with the primer I feel it evens out to a pinky-peach shade. I do not understand undertones, I get very frustrated trying to figure them out for products and my own skin (I still understand heck-all about whether I'm cool, warm or soylent green). So, if anybody out there has this bb cream or would like to make an educated assumption based on the photos on what undertone it is, please let me know and I'll put it in bold.\n\nThe Etude House bb dries down to a semi-matte finish. It does not feel oily or overly-dry at first, however I do mist my face with a moisturizing toner as I like a more sheer look. Depending on how much you layer, you can get moderate to full coverage. However, I would not recommend more than two layers because you can get real cakey real quick. For reference, I always wear one light layer. I find that wearing this without a facial mist dries out my normal/oily combo skin, accentuating both dry and oily parts of my face. Again, this is a somewhat matte formula, so it‚Äôs dry by nature. It wears well for about 10 hours, which is when it starts to wear off a little patchy and become overly-shiny. I like this so much that I am looking to purchase the moist version cushion.\n\nThe Holika Holika primer is super nice. It's tinted purple, which gives a subtle brightening effect. The cream feels lightweight and smoothing, like a good primer should. While not feeling tacky, it still helps bb cream to adhere to the skin and last longer. I don't think I would recommend this to those with large pores since it seems to be more of a color correcting product and the smoothing and filling effect is minimal. The Nabi line has 3 shades: Cottony, Vitality and Shiny. Cottony is purple, Vitality is pink, and Shiny is beige. In the imgur album, I listed the one I have as Vitality since that's what I ordered, but now I'm pretty sure that I had Cottony all this time? I didn't think much of it at the time since I'm bad with color and I really liked the results I got with it. This may be the only mishap with RRS I've had to date, and it ended up being a gift since pink makes me look overly-red (EH Face Blur, I love you.... but why?).\n\nfeel: 4.5/5\n>The primer is excellent for what it does. I do not have enlarged pores, so it's really convenient for me to have a primer that acts as both a color corrector and makeup base without being heavy. Etude house makes my favorite bb creams, and it's nice to find a color that matches my semi-light, mystery-undertoned skin while wearing beautifully. The only complaint that I have is the slightly short wear-time and the dryness of the standalone cream. If you like matte/semi-matte products, I would recommend this because it's still a lot gentler than other matte foundations I've tried. Both of these smell like makeup, not overly perfumed or sickly but just kind of like setting powder.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$5.83 for 35g (bb cream) & $7.83 for 50g (primer). Super economical, and it's still amazing. I wear makeup sparingly, so these both will probably last me just under their full 12 month shelf lives.\n\npersonal rating: 4.5/5\n>I'm not one to settle on one product, especially with skincare, but I really feel no inclination to try out any other primers. Between this and my Etude House Face Blur, I'm all good. Would definitely repurchase. For the bb cream, I'll probably use this one all up before trying out its moist cushion type. I really love Etude House for makeup: really good formulas, my skin has no problems with it and all their products look really pretty. Would repurchase from the same brand/makeup line.\n\n----------\n\n**Etude House Dear Darling Tint in 01 Berry Red** [Product Link - Ingredients are not on CosDNA, but can be found in the \"Ingredients\" tab on its Memebox page](https://us.memebox.com/dear-darling-tint-01-berry-red)\nSkipping ahead a little here, but this is still makeup I suppose. I am kind of impartial to this line of tints. They are very pretty and stain well, but they don't last through me biting my lips and applying balm all the time. I am forever searching for one that will, but these do a good job for now. I own two of their tints now. Have [more swatches](http://i.imgur.com/d3r9zxe.jpg) with Berry Red on the left and Vampire Red on the right. The berry red smells sweet, like some kind of fruity candy. It wears well for about an hour before I've bitten or rubbed it off.\n\nfeel: 4/5\n>Smells amazing, decently pigmented and beautiful color. This is a gel type tint, and application can be streaky. The applicator and rim can also become very messy. Color probably lasts longer if you don't eat your lips throughout the day.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6 for 4.5g. It does run out kind of fast, but for Memebox it's a solid price for the product amount.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like this, but I don't like having to reapply all the time. I'll probably keep looking for a tint that survives my lip biting and moisturizing habit. I recommend it to those who can generally leave their lips alone.\n\n\n*CLEANSING*\n\n\n**Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**[CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_5319235682.html) [Product Link](https://us.memebox.com/low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser)\nI love this cleanser. It's my holy grail for body wash and my go-to for gentle wash after chemical peels. It's a perfect, simple gel cleanser. It does not strip my skin of moisture, it helps keeps my body blemish-free and it lasts for-damn-ever. Seriously, I use this every day and I only just ran out of my first bottle. It contains no sls, but it does of course still have other surfactants and \"sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\". I tend to follow [Fifty Shades of Snail's theory](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/08/23/review-tosowoong-enzyme-powder-wash/) on acidic cleansers and harsh surfactants anyway, and this cleanser clocks in at around 5.5 pH.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Like most low-pH cleansers, it leaves my skin feeling clean, but not dry. It smells noticeably like tea tree oil, (which is a scent I love very much so it scores even more points) and it lathers lightly using just your hands or moderately if you use a washcloth or exfoliating gloves. I use the body shop's brand of exfoliating gloves in conjunction with this, and my skin is always smooth and happily clear of any kind acne.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$10 for 150 ml. RoseRoseShop has it listed for $6.07 and Jolse for $8.80 at the time of writing this review. is gud price friend.\n\npersonal rating: 5/5\n>Holy Grail status achieved. I used to suffer from some pretty frequent breakouts on my back and butt (if you know me personally and are reading this just know that my butt is smooth as hell now, heck outta here) until I started using this cleanser, and now that I combine it with exfoliating gloves I have literally none of the problem spots or painful cysts that I'd been getting since puberty. I will forever continue to purchase this product and have bought 2 more bottles since running out of my first one a couple days ago.\n\n----------\n\n**Holika Holika Soda Pore Cleansing Cleansing Soda Water** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_f87f134194.html) [Product Link](http://www.roseroseshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=60172)\nThis palindrome of a product name belongs to my current eye makeup remover. I bought this product (as well as the Holika Holika primer) after seeing it in the routine of an AB/skincare youtuber named Elaine Mokk. Love her content and reviews despite it being less \"this works, here's why\" and more \"this was cute, it also happened to be a decent product this time\". Anyway, this cleansing water's main ingredients are water and alcohol. I suspect this is why I have problems with it. Not because I'm sensitive to alcohol, which I'm not, but because for me, the purpose of this product as an eye remover means that when it gets in my eye, it's a shitshow. It stings substantially and I end up rubbing my eyes like a madwoman trying to get it over with. I thought that maybe I was using too much product, and while using less made it more bearable and in most cases kept it from getting past my lashes and into my delicate corneas, the pump on this thing is a nightmare. No matter how gently and slowly you try to press the plunger top, you always press too hard and end up with a wet cotton round and a dry office-stare of contempt at the bottle. I thought that I would use this up to avoid being wasteful, but considering that I'm already worried about the integrity and health of my eyes, I think I'll be giving this away or selling it on ABExchange to somebody who would use it for the face instead. It's not bad at removing makeup, it's just not good for eyes.\n\nfeel: 1/5\n>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$6.63 for 150 ml. A great price if you can make it work for you.\n\npersonal rating: 2/5\n>I'm only giving it a 2 because it still removes makeup well. Otherwise, it's totally unenjoyable for what I wanted to use it for. Side note, I used this on my face to remove foundation a few times and found that it worked pretty good, about the same as my camellia and jojoba oil blend. I just don't see myself giving that up for this product, though.\n\n\n*MISCELLANEOUS*\n\n\n**Skinfood Argan Oil Silk Hair Mist**\nThis product apparently no longer exists. It's not on the site I bought it from, it's not on the skinfood website or CosDNA and if you google \"skinfood argan oil silk hair mist\" you get one defunct Skinfood US listing and literally 4 pictures on the images tab that show the product I have. I suppose the argan oil hair line has been reformulated and the mist fell under the radar or it was an exclusive. I'm betting on the former.\nLong story short, I have a love-hate relationship with this. When I bought it, I had no idea what was in it, what problems it claimed to target or what its reputation was. I've been doing no-poo since I was 15 years old and using 100% undiluted baking soda on my scalp, straight scooped out of the orange box and dumped it on my head until I wizened the hell up and used the rest of the time I spend on my hair up to this point doing damage control. Now that the hair that was once on top of my head is at the bottom, I've got basically straw for ends. I was in a state of denial about needing a haircut after not having had one for over 9 months and was looking for some help with fried ends and breakage. This mist is very nice. It smells very floral, if argan oil smells like what I think it smells like, then this smells like that. I remember one of the claims was that the main extract in the formula is broccoli extract. It also claims to have hydrolyzed silk. Whatever it was (and I know what it was), my hair looked amazing. It was sleek and kempt, no flyaways, the broken hairs around the crown of my head stayed down and my ends didn't look as much like a dollar store paintbrush. I used it often.  I took it upon myself to translate the ingredients on the back via google translate's draw feature, plugging in the hangul one at a time.\n\n>Purified water, Ethanol, Glycerin, PEG-Q150, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Dipropylene Glycol, Hydroxyethyl Urea, Polysorbate 20, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Glutamic Acid, Dimethicone,\n\nI stopped at dimethicone, which is a big \"don't\" ingredient for my hair and the whole point of the no shampoo method. I like this mist a lot, but not enough to go back to conventional shampoo and conditioner. I‚Äôm also not sure if the effects of it were really as great as I thought they were or if it was all the reintroduction of silicone. Since the stuff is out of production anyway, I don‚Äôt think it matters. I‚Äôll probably sell/give this away too.\n\nfeel: 5/5\n>Lightweight, smells great, helps with styling and general appearance.\n\nprice: 4/5\n>$6.43 for 145 ml, which is not bad but considering mists are supposed to be used liberally, you‚Äôd go through this fairly fast.\n\npersonal rating: 3/5\n>I‚Äôd use this product if it was friendly to my preferences. The ingredients don‚Äôt look impressive aside from hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycans, which is an amino sugar that supposedly promotes growth and extends the life cycle of hair. Maybe I‚Äôll try it again and end up changing my routine to incorporate it just to see if it helps.\n\n----------\n\n**Mizon Acence AC Care Solution Mark X Blemish After Cream** [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_3050164581.html) [Product Link]( http://www.roseroseshop.com/mizon-acence-ac-care-solution-mark-x-blemish-after-cream-30ml.html)\nThis is an after-care cream that‚Äôs meant to be used on spots that have just been squeezed. That‚Äôs all I can gather from the little infographic that RoseRoseShop has. I used this on both blemishes that had been drained and ones that had not and I was surprised at how well this worked. My dark spots faded much quicker and after using it there were no recurrences of any of the pimples that I squeezed. It did not irritate my skin. This cream does leave a really waxy residue, though. The directions say to let it absorb into your skin, but it never fully does. Maybe that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be, but if you use it before bed it can get smeared on your pillow, face and hair. The ingredients are all very promising and effective, which I generally find is a theme for Mizon products. Let‚Äôs say a blemish takes 1 week to heal over completely; with this cream applied once every night, overnight, the time is shortened to around 4 days.\n\nfeel: 3/5\n>The effect of this product comes with a price: super waxy, oily film left behind. If you are sensitive to olive oil, try this at your own risk. At one point, I thought this cream was breaking me out, but I have used this many times after that and found that I was wrong.\n\nprice: 5/5\n>$4.93 for a 30 ml tube.\n\npersonal rating: 4/5\n>I like what it does for my trouble spots and can tolerate any greasiness that comes with it. I said I used it on both squeezed and closed spots, and I can definitely tell that it‚Äôs more effective on a drained area than one that still has gunk beneath the surface.\n\nThat‚Äôs it! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I‚Äôll answer with any information that I have (^:",

    "body": "**EDIT: I am quite angry. I feel like all of my concerns have been ignored. I woke up today to find that the KK Store owner is actively promoting the glitters on her facebook and giving them away for free. She has obviously chosen to ignore legitimate concerns and carry on regardless. I do not find the neons in the store inventory but she is still promoting unsafe and dangerous products. I have reported the store to the Store Envy team and will be making a complaint to the FDA and I ask that you all do the same.**\n\n**EDIT EDIT: I just received a message from her, she said that she was not the one controlling the facebook page so she didn't see that it was still being promoted. She has also now removed all glitters from sale and will be reformulating them. She asked if I would be interested in doing a follow up review once she has fixed everything and I told her that i would. i think that is only fair :)**\n\n\nEarlier today I made a post asking for advice regarding a brand I had gotten involved with. [The post is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/31akqi/help_needed_re_possibly_unsafe_cosmetics_and_fda/). My reasons for with holding the brand name were innocent and simple. It was not done maliciously or to cause drama. I had been invited by a friend (who I had \"worked\" with on Rockeresque's promo team) to join up with the Korpse Kosmetics Promo team. As it was a friend who was also part of the group, I happily joined them, expecting the same kind of fun we had in Rockeresque, I stupidly did not research the brand first as I trusted my friend. I am not from the USA and needed some help determining if the products reached FDA guidelines as they are different to my own countries and I didn't want to share the name immediately as I felt that I should inform the owner that :\n\n* 1. I was not happy with the products\n* 2. I felt the products were not to FDA guidelines\n* 3. I would not be promoting them\n\nbefore I went ahead and made a bad review. I have had a few PM's from people who guessed the brand, had similar experiences and a few who were annoyed I didn't straight up out the company. If you feel it was unfair of me to check facts and show a little courtesy to the owner I am sorry that you feel that way.\n\nAnyway, aside from being very irritated with myself for not fact checking and blindly trusting a friend, here is the whole saga.\n\n\n[Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ)\n\n\nI agreed to join the Korpse Kosmetics (KK) Promo team in January based on my friends recommendation. The owner was pleased to have me on board and welcomed me to the group She is incredibly friendly and helpful and I hope that she doesn't hate me for an honest review. I placed a large-ish order of 6 lip paints and 4 eyeliners, and I was incredibly excited to get them. A few days after the order was placed I was invited to show my work at a convention. I messaged the owner and asked if it was possible to purchase some sample bags or something to give away to customers. She was very helpful and actually offered to send them with my order for free. So far everything was going to plan.\n\nThe convention was in the first week of March and 5 days before I received a message from Store Envy that my order had been shipped. I knew that it would not arrive in time and asked if the owner would like the sample returning. This question was never answered and it did not matter as by mid March the package was still MIA. I contacted the owner a few times, keeping her updated and she did appear to make efforts to track the package. In the end she re-sent the order with \"a few bonus goodies for the trouble\". Again I was very happy with the communication and service I was receiving and believed the international postage was to blame.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, the package arrived as as most of you will probably understand this feeling, I was excited for products! The light was bad so I decided to wait until this morning to open the package and test, photograph and enjoy the products. As a bonus for the wait I received 4 neon glitters which are promoted as cosmetic grade. All the products came in 5gram clear jars with black lids and home made product stickers (which are pretty cute) So far everything seems on a par with other Indie Brands I have tested.\n\nThen I turned the jars over and instead of finding a little label with ingredients and the shade name, I found a small sticker with a handwritten shade name. Now this seemed a little odd and unprofessional but as someone in the other thread pointed out, they might've chosen to save a few bucks on official stickers. \n\nOn the website I did find an ingredient listing but it was a generic, \"our products contain these\" not specific listings for each shade and product. I also noted that there was not weight or product size information for each product.\n\nNow the glitters have a few problems. First off the sparkle is almost non existent. They are plastic like and are very large sand like chunks. Even my husband thought that I had purchased craft sand and was concerned that I would use it on my face, and he knows NOTHING of cosmetics. They are also a little static, so the particles stick together and it is hard to get a smooth layer don't worry I did not put these on my face!) When compared to one of the LIT Cosmetic glitters it was even more painful to see the low quality.\n\nNext the lipsticks or Lip Paints as they are named. They smelled terrible but I am fully aware that scent is a preference. They are semi solid, quite greasy and some of them were not mixed properly with lumps of unblended (is that the right word?) pigment in the mixture. It is also obvious by the vast amount of air pockets in the jars that the mixture is not made liquid and then decanted into the jars. Instead it seems to be smushed in and does not fill the whole space of the jar. The jars were also in my opinion, carelessly filled. Some were over flowing with product in the threads of the jar, some filled the lid and others appeared to contain less product than others.\n\nWhen I opened the eyeliners I was confronted with the same situation and smell. I also noted immediately that one of the eyeliners appeared to be IDENTICAL to one of the lip paints. Which really annoyed me as I don't want or need two pots of the same product. If the lipstick is eye safe or eyeliner lip safe then I am happy. I also failed to find this information on the website. I swatched the two apparently identical products side by side and I really feel that they are the same. Maybe the eyeliner is *slightly* thicker consistency, but it is not enough for it to be a liner in my opinion. The eyeliners also had the same greasy, vaseline like texture as the lip paints. \n\nI also discovered a fingerprint in the lid of one of the lipsticks.\n\nAt this point I can to r/indiemakeupandmore for some advice regarding cosmetic grade glitter, ingredient listings and the sale of products which are apparently identical but labeled differently.\n\nThrough the post I came into contact with a number of people who had had equally dodgy dealings with the brand but  will leave it up to them to tell their stories.\n\nAn hour after swatching the colours on my arm I developed a red blotchy and itchy rash but now 5 hours later it has subsided and all seems well.\n\nAlso contacted the owner with all of my above concerns. She got back to me and addressed each point:\n(I am going to copy paste her answers)\n\n* Handwritten labels: \"yes I usually write the names on the bottom with the stickers. Since I print all the labels myself it saves a lot of ink\"\n\n* The smell: \"really? they didn't have a smell to me,  In the lip paints I used some essential oils to make it have more of a lipstick smell.\" \n\n* The similarities between lip paint and eyeliner: \"The liners and lip paints are really different tho I do understand how they do look a lot alike and have been trying to change that\"\n\n* Ingredients listings: \"Well I have it on my website. But I can change to printing the bottom labels with the ingredients\" (She also provided me with the ingredients listings but again just generic ingredients, not specific to each shade)\n\n\nEyeshadows: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, TITANIUM Dioxide, Iron Oxide & May Contain Some Glitters\n\n\nBlushes: \nKosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nSirens Glow: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nMINERAL Veils: Kosher Rice Powder, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide\n\n\nLip Paints:Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxide, Castor Seed Oil, Cetyl Stearyl Alcohol, Olive Fruit Oil, HYDROGENATED Castor Oil, Glycine Soybean Lipds, Lauryl Laurate, Carnauba Wax, Candillia Wax.\n\n\n* Fingerprint: \"Well I make sure I sanatize my hands before working on each inditvidual shadow or liner or whatever but I shall get some gloves asap\"\n\n* Glitter:  The glitters are cosmetic grade. I purchased them from a well known site. (she provided me with links to the products she purchased and was under the impression she had purchased [Ben Nye Glitters](http://www.starcostumes.com/Sparklers-Glitter-5-oz-p/abld.htm?1=1&CartID=0), this is the link for the [Neons](http://www.dhgate.com/product/1kg-0-3mm-neon-glitter-dust-body-glitter/181828155.html?utm_source=pla&utm_medium=GMC&utm_campaign=della520&utm_term=181828155&f=bm%7c181828155%7c018009-NailArtSalon%7cGMC%7cAdwords%7cpla%7cdella520%7cUS%7c018009006-NailArt%7cc%7c%7c0LRF%7c&gclid=CjwKEAjw9PioBRDdpqy0-ofG3DgSJAACe5NEqioYBdo-w_TTTg8vhRNOKSl2Zqbfa8_wqrZf1KiwbBoC1ALw_wcB)  I also spoke to my lovely friend who works for a cosmetics company and from the pictures it was said that these glitters are not cosmetic grade. \n\n* When I told her that the glitters were most likely NOT cosmetic grade: \"Are you serious?WTF.....I'm going to have to contact them right now and leave them a nasty message, okay now im really upset. Thank you for letting me know. I really do appreciate it and so so sorry.\nI feel terrible\"\n\n\nNow it is up to you, I feel as though although her answers were a bit vague and sketchy, she seemed genuinely upset about the glitters. Personally I don't know how she thought she was getting Ben Nye for that price, or that she couldn't see that the glitter was not of good quality but I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt. She has promised to make changes and I hope that she does. She was upset but happy that I was honest and the conversation was amicable. She also understood why I would not be joining the promo team and asked if it was ok to get advice if needed. \n\nThe album of the cosmetics is here [Pictures are here](http://imgur.com/a/XWyGQ), linked at the top too, with lots of captions. Sorry for the monster wall of text, I hope everyone is satisfied with this review. I wanted the whole story before making a bad review. I love Indie Brands and this has not put me off. I will continue on my indie quest. In 3 years this is the first bad experience I have had and hopefully it will be my last. To all the awesome Indie Brands out there, I love you!\n",

Wash your hands. Touched your clothes? Wash your hands. I don't trust she's been that diligent. If she was that determined to keep her hands sterile, she'd just wear gloves.",

Even Huda advertised her skincare launch for WEEKS before she had the first product. I feel like of anyone, Huda would be able to launch a skincare brand day of and the product would sell out. Her and Beyonc√© maybe. \n\nIf this new launch was such a big deal, it would have been one of the first products they advertised for premium. Like ‚Äúhey! If you sign up for premium, you‚Äôll be one of the first people to try this brand new brand! And we are going to educate you on it all month so you are super hyped to use it!‚Äù\n\nFinding a product on Alibaba with the exact same packaging and name for $2 is so sketchy... especially when you have 0 internet presence, if you were gonna fake people out like this in a smart way they would have made sure that as soon as you googled the product or company their website would show up first. Even fake a couple product reviews.\n\nI‚Äôm so confused about how this possibly happened. Like they‚Äôve had weird brands like Illuminati sponges in their boxes before but no one cares about that because it‚Äôs just a cheap sponge. Not exciting,  but also no one is gonna look up their sponge to see the ingredients etc. because it‚Äôs just a sponge. It‚Äôs different with skincare. \n\nI saw someone on Instagram way ‚Äúthis should have gone in the base box‚Äù no... don‚Äôt do us dirty like that. How this ever made it in a box is very confusing. Be careful out there, friends... and keep this stuff away from your face.",

    "body": "Hello everyone, I‚Äôm a long-time lurker and first-time poster on this sub.\n\nI‚Äôm 29(F) and my skin type is fucked up (dry cheeks, oily T-zone, with a recent bout of hormonal acne along cheekbones and jawline).\n\nI use Epiduo that has adapalene (0.1% w/w) + benzoyl Peroxide (2.5% w/w) and Glyco-12 cream (glycolic acid 12%) in my PM routine (alternatively, with a break day in between each treatment). In the AM, I finish up my skincare routine with Re'equil Ultra Matte Dry Touch Sunscreen Gel SPF 50 PA++++ and touch up with a sunscreen stick every two hours or so (I go over the same area 3-4 times with the stick for optimum protection).\n\nLike most people, I struggle with sunscreen reapplication because, honestly, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass. I‚Äôd rather put it on once in the morning and then forget about it for the rest of the day. However, as I‚Äôm currently battling hormonal acne and PIH brought on by PCOS and the fact that I stopped taking oral birth control pills, I‚Äôve been subjecting my face to some pretty strong actives like adapalene and glycolic acid. And, I‚Äôve also recently had some warts removed from around my eyes and on my neck via cauterization. Given these treatments and because I spend a lot of time outdoors, I knew I had to become more diligent with sunscreen reapplication to prevent sun-related hyperpigmentation. And since I‚Äôm lazy af and don‚Äôt like touching my face often, I turned to sunscreen sticks. Please note that I do not know much about the ingredients, but have listed them below for reference. Here is my review of the three sunscreen sticks I‚Äôve tried so far:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4v40q0j04t91.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57160c139b133d631630407c20ffca566e08110b\n\n**1.** **TOCOBO Cotton Soft Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dibutyl Adipate, Propanediol, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Terephthalylidene Dicamphor Sulfonic Acid, Polyglyceryl-3 Distearate, Niacinamide, Tromethamine, Cetearyl Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Pentylene Glycol, Polysilicone-15, Vigna Radiata Seed Extract, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Extract, Sophora Flavescens Root Extract, Rheum Palmatum Root/Stalk Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Phellodendron Amurense Bark Extract, Oenothera Biennis (evening primrose) Flower Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Pinus Palustris Leaf Extract, Pueraria Lobata Root Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Gossypium Herbaceum (cotton) Seed Oil, Polymethylsilsesquioxane, Sodium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Vp Copolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Adenosine, Butylene Glycol, Tocopherol, Fragrance\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1240\n\n**Experience and opinion:** I really had high hopes for this one, I saw so many good reviews online. To be fair, its not a bad sunscreen stick. It glides on the skin easily enough, and sinks into your skin to give a matte powdery finish. But, it has a strong (imo) scent. It‚Äôs a linen-y kinda scent, which I just don‚Äôt like. This scent even lingers for quite some time after application, which makes it even more annoying. Honestly, I don‚Äôt care about fragrance in skincare as long as I like the fragrance, and I just don‚Äôt like the fragrance in this sunstick.  Another con is its shape, which makes it hard to use under the eyes. Overall, if you don‚Äôt mind the fragrance, it‚Äôs a decent sunstick.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP, I can‚Äôt get over the smell.\n\n**2.** **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Airy Sun Stick SPF50+ PA++++**\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Polyethylene, Propylheptyl Caprylate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Homosalate, Silica, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Neopentyl Glycol Diheptanoate, Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Butylene Glycol, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Niacinamide, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Vinyl Dimethicone, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Ozokerite, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Pinus Pinaster Bark Extract, Bambusa Vulgaris Water, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ceramide NP, Glycerin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Ulmus Davidiana Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyurethane-11, Glyceryl Caprylate, Sorbitan Sesquioleate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Astaxanthin, Pentylene Glycol, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Ascorbyl Propyl Hyaluronate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Hyaluronic Acid, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Beauty Barn for INR 1480\n\n**Experience and opinion:** My absolute favourite and current HG for reapplication! You can see from the picture that the writing on the packaging has faded because I‚Äôve handled it so much. It has no fragrance, just a faint chemical scent which dissipates quickly after application. It takes a few seconds to warm up on your skin, after which it glides oh so smoothly. It has no white caste, and has a matte satin-y finish, which I LOVE. A little bit tacky to touch immediately after application, but sinks into your skin in a few minutes and becomes barely noticeable. Best part: its tear drop shape!! This makes such a difference, it makes it so easy to touch up under my eyes and around my nose.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WRP absolutely I love it so much!!\n\n**3.** **Av√®ne SunsiStick KA SPF 50+**\n\n**Ingredients:** Octyldodecanol, Polyethylene, Butylene Glycol Cocoate, Hydrogenated Microcrystalline Wax, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water (Aqua), 1,2-Hexanediol, Aluminum Hydroxide, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/‚ÄãCapric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Cichorium Intybus (Chicory) Root Extract, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methyl Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Oxothiazolidine, Saccharin, Sodium Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Tocopheryl Glucoside.\n\n**Where to buy and price:** Box of Color for INR 743.\n\n**Experience and opinion:** This was the first ever sunscreen stick I purchased and it made me almost give up on all sunsticks. It has a chemical-y waxy kind of fragrance but my biggest qualm with this sunstick is its texture and finish. It has a Vaseline-kinda balm-y texture that just sits on top of your skin and looks like you‚Äôre slugging during the day. Needless to say it gives an oily finish, not even dewy, which looks awful on my skin type. Its extremely transferrable and gets all over your hands if you happen to touch your face. I despise it and I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll use up the product.\n\n**Repurchase status:** WNRP never ever, god I hate it.",

Some of these are repeats and some were first time bought. Let me start with the repeats:\n\n**1) Minimalist Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid 16%**\n\n**üí∏Price:** Rs. 599/- for 20 ml. I got Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen SPF 40 free with it.\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, 3-O-Ethyl Ascorbic Acid, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Butylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Sodium Citrate, Citric Acid, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Gluconate, Ferulic Acid, Coceth-7, Phenoxyethanol, PPG-1-PEG-9 Lauryl Glycol Ether, Fullerenes, Tocopherol Acetate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PVP, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate\n\n**üç∂Packaging:** Dropper black bottle, comes with an extra carton\n\n**Fragrance:** None \n\nIf there's one product I've always raved about, it's this Vitamin C Serum. This has become my HG that I've purchased Multiple times now, and will probably repurchase in future. \n\nI love how it lasts longer and doesn't oxidise quickly compared to other Vitamin C Serums, and there's a no difference in my skin on its usage. It does a good job at lightening and fading acne spots and marks. The only other Vitamin C Serum I like is Cosrx 23%, but it's quite heavy on the pockets. \n\nI'm quite tempted to try out the Klairs and the Numbuzin one. Would appreciate the reviews if anyone has used them.\n\n**2) Formularx Hydrashied Vitamin C + Peptide Watery Gel Sunscreen SPF 50 PA ++++**\n\n**üí∏Price:** Rs. 699/- for 50 ml. It's frequently available on BOGO offers on their website.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Vitamin C, Peptides, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Octocrylene, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Titanium Dioxide, Centella Asiatica Extract, Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Polygonum Cuspidatum Root Extract, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate/VP Copolymer, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Gold, Disodium EDTA, Pentapeptide-4, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Glutathione, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitol, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract\n\n**üç∂Packaging:** Tube\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is my second tube, and I love the texture. It's very lightweight, absorbs easily, no greasiness on the skin and yes, No whitecast. It also doesn't burn my eyes, like the Minimalist Invisible Sunscreen. I doubt it's waterproof, as the tube does state to reapply after exposure to water. Using this post snail mucin essence or a hyaluronic moisturizer gives a dewy look. \n\nAs far as protecting against sun exposure goes, I do cover my face with a dupatta when I leave home. I'd say there's a light tan on my face coz the summer heat is at its peak. Though labmuffin says that good sunscreen don't always prevent tan so I don't know what to say about that. \n\nAs far as the texture goes, it's Amazing, just don't expect miracles when it comes to sun protection.\n\n**3) Pyungkal Yul Calming Moisture  Barrier Cream**\n\n**üí∏ PRICE:** Rs. 1250/- for 50 ml. Frequently available on discounts at Maccaron\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Centella Asiatica, Ceramides\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Isohexadecane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Stearic Acid, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Lonicera Japonica (Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Glucoside, Pentylene Glycol, Trehalose, Ceramide NP, Arachidic Acid, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, Oleic Acid, Centella Asiatica Extract, Madecassoside, Madecassic Acid, Asiaticoside, Asiatic Acid, Squalane, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Hydroxyacetophenone, Butylene Glycol, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol, Tromethamine, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin\n\n**Packaging:** Tub\n\n**Fragrance:** None\n\nThis is a BOMB moisturizer. Having a combination skin with oily Tzone always meant trouble finding a good barrier repair cream. Most barrier repair moisturizer having ceramides have thicker textures that feel either too heavy or too greasy, or both, on the skin.\n\nNow I had just started Olay Retinol Serum, and was in need to a ceramide moisturizer to protect my skin barrier. I just randomly bought this on Maccaron when it was available on a great discount.\n\nAnd I've found my HG. It's so good, so lightweight, not at all heavy and soothing. I always end up with a pimple while trying ceramide cream but this one was so light it didn't feel greasy at all. \n\nI'm in love and this has definitely entered my list of future repurchase. \n\n**4) Beauty of Joseon Ginseng Essence Water**\n\n**üí∏Price:**  Rs. 1500/- for 150ml Available on discounts at multiple websites\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Ginseng, Niacinamide, Adenosine\n\n**Ingredients:** Panax Ginseng Root Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Propanediol, Niacinamide, 1,2-Hexanediol, Water, Hydroxyacetophenone, Glyceryl Glucoside, Panthenol, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Adenosine, Dextrin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Disodium Edta, Glucose, Panax Ginseng Callus Culture Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Ethylhexylglycerin, Lactobacillus/Panax Ginseng Root Ferment Filtrate, Sodium Hyaluronate\n\n**Claims:** Cruelty free, no artificial fragrance, colorants, mineral oil, parabens, sulfates.\n\nA cult favourite toner, how could I skip this? And here's my judgement, it's good to damp your skin and give a nice plump. Not ideal if you're looking for the glass skin effect. I think this is one of those products that don't give an immediate result, but when you use it consistently, you do feel your skin looks better. \n\nHaving said that, I don't think this would be a repurchase. It's good, but nothing that stood out. I'd rather experiment with multiple other toners available in the market. ",

I guess because it‚Äôs pure ascorbic acid it really does a good job on giving a subtle brightening glow and lightening some spots.\n\nAlso it is not very mild so when i started using it alone it gave me dry flaky skin.

    "body": "[Here](https://imgur.com/a/Mnijy) are some pictures of the goods! \n\nWhen you get a haul, even a mini one, there is always at least one thing that doesn't work out the way you thought it would. For my finicky skin, it's usually several things. So I was ***shocked*** when not only did everything from my recent AB haul work for me, but it all worked ***really*** well. So well that I wanted to share my excitement with all of you! I'm still mildly in disbelief right now, this never happens. \n\nCVS was having a BOGO 50% off sale so I decided to try a couple things that I‚Äôve had my eye on. I thought these reviews might be helpful for those in this sub that aren‚Äôt very familiar with AB products. My routine is a mix of different types of brands (I do love my French pharmacy products) but I‚Äôve had a lot more luck finding things that work for my skin type in the AB world. Some people get scared off at the idea of ordering things from overseas - either because of shipping cost or the length of shipping times. Since these are all products carried at CVS, they are a lot more accessible for those in the US. \n\n**Skin type:** Oily, dehydration-prone, sometimes sensitive (depends on its mood that day), with a very low tolerance for silicones. \n\n**Holika Holika Aloe Cleansing Foam -** I've had rough luck with foaming cleansers as they all seem to strip my skin (other than my HG LRP Toleraine but it's fun to switch it up sometimes). Not this guy! My skin loves anything aloe and this did not disappoint (aloe is the best humectant for oily skin imo). It has a very dense, thick foam that feels very nice on my skin. The scent is very fresh, it almost reminds me of fresh-cut watermelon and aloe mixed together. It leaves my skin very soft and not remotely stripped. No squeaky-clean feeling here! I'm not positive of the pH but it does contain potassium hydroxide (a pH adjuster) so I'm assuming it's in the normal range and not on the higher end. I think this is going to make a great AM cleanser since it's so gentle. \n\nIngredients: \nAloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Water, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Myristic Acid, Lauric Acid, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Potassium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Chlorphenesin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Palmitic Acid, Capric Acid, Butylene Glycol, Betula Platyphylla Japonica Juice, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Propylene Glycol, Glycerin, Citrullus Lanatus (Watermelon) Fruit Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate.\n\n(*Ah-ha! I just saw the watermelon extract as I was adding this, so that explains the lovely scent.)\n\n**Peach Slices Citrus-Honey Aqua Glow Hydrating Moisture Gel -** Holy shit you guys, this is ***everything*** I've been looking for in a winter moisturizer. It's lightweight, a gel, has ceramides, is hydrating *and* moisturizing and doesn't make me oily. The search is over! Seriously, I've been trying to find the perfect moisturizer for about 8 months now. I thought I had the perfect one (Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream) but turns out it was perfect *for summer*. Once winters cold, dry air came it just wasn't enough. I've desperately wanted to add ceramides to my routine with no luck (Rosette Ceramide Gel was a greasy disaster). The inclusion of ceramides is what originally caught my eye and also the lack of any -cones. My skin is sensitive to silicones and finding a heavier winter moisturizer without any has been virtually impossible. This does include a couple -anes so I was skeptical at first but they don‚Äôt seem to bother me as much as straight up dimethicone. Dimethicone + my skin = a greasy mess and lots of clogged pores (and fun little whiteheads all over). The first time I used it, I squeezed out too much but thought 'what the heck, I'll see what happens'. As I began to spread it around, I realized that it was *way* too much product and figured I was doomed for an oily face that night. Cut to a few minutes later, when I was shocked to find that it had ***all*** absorbed. It dries down quickly to a soft, almost-matte finish. It legit gives my skin a healthy glow without making it oily, something that I didn't think was possible. The first time I wore it to work, I was ***incredibly*** impressed by the fact that my skin was still matte at the end of the day. My work's super dry air usually drives my dehydrated skin nuts and by the end of the day, it's over-produced a ton of oil to compensate. But not with this!! It gives my skin the hydration it always needs with just enough moisture to seal it all in. I am absolutely over-the-moon in love with this product and I can't recommend it enough! \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Propanediol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Polysorbate 60, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Honey Extract, Ceramide Np, Sorbitan Stearate, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Cetearyl Alcohol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Isohexadecane, Tromethamine, Hydroxyacetophenone, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Polysorbate 80, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sorbitan Oleate, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Fruit Oil, Disodium EDTA, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Butylene Glycol, Bixa Orellana Seed Oil, Tocopherol.\n\n**The Saem Iceland Hydrating Soothing Gel -** The name pretty much says it all and it lives up to those claims. It's very hydrating, soothing and feels very refreshing. The fascinating thing about this product is how it dries down. It leaves an almost undetectable finish. I've never had anything disappear into my skin before - and I say that in the best way possible. It doesn't leave a tacky film the way most gels do. I use the Skinfood aloe gel daily (which does leave a bit of stickiness) and out of curiosity, I applied this on top of it. The combo dried down to almost nothing! It took away the stickiness all together. I am highly impressed with this gel! It is definitely a staple in my routine now and (*gasp*) may just replace my beloved Skinfood aloe (at least in the AM).\n\nIngredients: Water, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate 20, Chlorphenesin, Carbomer, Perfume, Sodium Acrylates Crosspolymer-2, Potassium Hydroxide, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Silica, Betaine, Heptane, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Mesembryanthemum Crystallinum Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene glycol, Cetraria Islandica Extract, Sorbitol, Citric acid, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Nelumbo Nucifera Flower Extract, Prunus Mume Fruit Extract, Lactic acid.\n\n**Elisha Coy Refreshing Ampoule Solution Sheet Mask -** Another product that lives up to its name. I was nervous because these are on the cheaper side and usually the quality reflects that. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised! The mask itself fit very well. It's on the thinner side and it reminds me a lot of my fav sheet masks, the Etude House 0.2mm Air Therapy. It stayed in place and despite the essence being very watery, it didn't drip everywhere. The mask really seemed to hold onto the essence. After I took it off, I patted in the remaining essence from the pouch and it all absorbed completely. I was able to continue my routine with no issues. My skin was left hydrated, soothed and happy. \n\nIngredients: Water, Dipropylene Glycol, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Magnolia Kobus Bark Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Betula Alba Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chrysanthellum Indicum Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance.\n\nI haven‚Äôt had the chance yet to try the rest of the sheet masks yet but I am very excited to do so!! If anyone has any questions, I‚Äôm happy to help! :)\n",

Royal Jelly, however, does not have any evidence of helping skin a whole lot.*\n\n*Potentially problematic ingredients: The oils in this are great, but the high % olive oil may be bothersome to acne-prone skin types.

The ‚ÄúGlycerol‚Äù product page title is a typo, as there is no glycerol in there.\n\n-\n\nRetinol & Niacinamide toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9b0a443774.html\n\n> Aqua, Niacinamide, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Polysorbate 20, Sodium Citrate, Ethylhexylglycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Panthenol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyacetophenone, Parfum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Jasminum Officinale Extract, Poloxamer 235, Retinol, Sodium Ascorbate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Oil, BHT, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, BHA, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Oil, Linalool, Coumarin. \n\nRetinol is quite low down but this has 5% Niacinamide, so it should be a good ‚Äúlots of Niacinamide but not as hefty as 10% Niacinamide‚Äù product, replacing the Simple soothing toner which never specified the exact content but has been reformulated to have less active ingredient since I last tested it, so here are some new tests and ingredients: https://imgur.com/a/QJhFAxZ\n\n-\n\nRose & hyaluronic acid toner http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_65a8443777.html\n\n> Aqua, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sambucus Nigra Flower Water, Butylene Glycol, Glycereth-26, Glycerin, Polysorbate 20, Propylene Glycol, Betaine, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Parfum, Allantoin, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Sodium PCA, Bisabolol, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hydroxide, Citronellol, Geraniol. \n\n-\n\n-\n\nRose oil http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8dcc443757.html\n\n> Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Punica Granatum Seed Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Parfum, Tocopherol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Peel Extract, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Citronellol, Geraniol, Benzyl Benzoate.\n\nHappy to see there are no plastics or silicones in there. Like the Pixi one it‚Äôs mostly almond and jojoba oil, plus (with the help of google) pomegranate, rosehip, vit E, orange peel extract, ‚Äúsweet scented geranium‚Äù(?), rose flower oil, various fragrances. Wasn‚Äôt sure if there was any point testing this, as oils are said to ‚Äúnot have pH‚Äù (what) but this does appear to have a pH of approx. 5 (~face pH) https://imgur.com/rkvQeer\n\nI didn‚Äôt buy the Pixi version as it‚Äôs still ¬£17+ on offer (at that point no), ingredients can be found at https://www.boots.com/pixi-rose-oil-blend-10256339\n\n-\n\nThese were all released in store today, toners are still available online and Aldi seem to have made more of them this time around. Rose oil is sold out online, *might* have to be quick to get it in the store.",

I have no connection to L‚ÄôHerboflore or Beautibi, other than being an enthusiastic customer willing to hand over a lot of my money. The only things I received for writing this review are firm, bouncy skin and a sore wrist.]**\n\n**[Also, there aren't any photos because it's evening here, and there are too many shadows, but I link to some sites where you can see pictures.]**\n\nOn a trip to Taiwan last October, I sought out the L‚ÄôHerboflore stand in the Taipei 101 building, eager to get my hands on some sheet masks. Much to my surprise, I discovered that L‚ÄôHerboflore carries a lot of products that aren‚Äôt sheet masks, such as cleansers, a toner, eye cream, exfoliating gel, moisturizers, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and powdered health drinks. I purchased a couple of these non-sheet mask items that I‚Äôll review down the road (I still need to finish testing them), and I‚Äôve been impressed enough with them that when I saw that the U.S. site Beautibi stocks some L‚ÄôHerboflore products, I decided to order the Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner, something I regretted not picking up in Taipei. Aside from the fact that L‚ÄôHerboflore products have impressed me, I was eager to incorporate more Taiwanese products, other than sheet masks, into my routine, since T-Beauty doesn‚Äôt get as much love around here as products from Korea, and to a lesser extent, Japan. \n\n*The low-down: what is this product?*\n\nThe L‚ÄôHerboflore ËïæËàíÁø†  [Aqua Plus Moisturizing Toner Ê∞¥ÁõàÊΩ§Êô∂Èú≤](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_detail.aspx?series=9&classid=29&id=88)   (hereafter known as Aqua Toner) is a hydrating toner that is part of [L‚ÄôHerboflore‚Äôs Aqua Plus line](http://www.lherboflore.com.tw/product_list.aspx?series=9&classid=29), which features products made from organic cactus elixir. The company claims that this toner will soothe irritated skin, hydrate one‚Äôs skin, and protect and firm one‚Äôs skin. \n\n*Ingredients:*\n\n(I don‚Äôt know if Taiwanese ingredients are listed in the same order as in the U.S., so I‚Äôm not sure how important the order is here; list is taken from the product box, which is slightly different from the Beautibi website) \n\nAqua (Water), Propanediol, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Panthenol, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glycerin, Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tremella Fuciformis Polysaccharide, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Fragrance, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, O-CYMEN-5-OL. \n\nI put the ingredients into [Cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_479b233703.html). Please keep in mind that just because something isn‚Äôt flagged in Cosdna doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be a problem for you. Similarly, Cosdna often flags things that are generally safe as being potentially unsafe as it doesn‚Äôt take into account the small concentration used in skin care products. In any case, please do not use this product if you have a known allergy or sensitivity to any of the above ingredients, and always patch test and isolation test new products. \n\n*According to Cosdna, the potentially acne-causing/unsafe ingredients (anything flagged a 3 or higher) are:*\n\n**Propylene glycol**, which is a humectant, receives a 3 for safety. Some people claim that it‚Äôs the same thing as antifreeze and that it‚Äôs a strong skin irritant. Paula‚Äôs Choice rates it as Good and explains that it‚Äôs used only in a tiny amount in skin care products (versus the amount you would find in antifreeze) and thus should not be an issue, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services does not deem it carcinogenic. You‚Äôll find this ingredient in a lot of products, including baby wipes, lip sticks, shampoos and conditioners, and moisturizers. I‚Äôve seen it in a lot of my other products, and I‚Äôm still alive. \n\nThe only potential acne trigger is **Triethanolamine**, which is pretty low at 2, but gets a 5 for safety. What is this supposedly dangerous substance? Triethanolamine is primarily used to adjust pH, but it also functions as an emulsifier. It‚Äôs found in various cosmetics, hair products, shaving creams, and sunscreens, in addition to some skin care products. The FDA has approved it as being safe for use as long as it is in a concentration below 5%. Various sources I checked said that in spite of the FDA approval, it shouldn‚Äôt be used long term. Paula‚Äôs Choice doesn‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs an issue and ranks it as Good, since the concentration used in cosmetics and skin care is low. I don‚Äôt know what the percentage is here, but I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs less than 5%. \n\n**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil** gets a 3 for safety. An emollient ingredient, Paula‚Äôs Choice gives it a rating of Good, though there are plenty of sites that are suspicious of it and recommend that is not be used on damaged or injured skin. \n\n**Fragrance** is flagged as being 1-4 in terms of safety, but we have no idea what kind of fragrance is being used here, or what concentration. I can say that the scent is rather light and dissipates quickly, so I don‚Äôt see fragrance as being an issue for most people with this product. \n\n**Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate**, a water-based preservative found in a wealth of skin care products and cosmetics, as well as many other products, gets a 4-6 for safety. It earns a Good from Paula‚Äôs Choice, and as the concentration used is likely very small, it shouldn‚Äôt be a concern for most people. I like my preservatives. \n\nOkay, those are the ‚Äúflagged‚Äù ingredients. After doing my own research on them, I‚Äôm not concerned that I‚Äôm about to melt off my face or contract cancer from using this product, but I am not a medical or scientific expert. Use this product at your own risk. \n\n*Onto the GOOD ingredients!*\n\nOur star is the **organic cactus extract**, or **Opuntia ficus-indica stem extract** (also known as **prickly pear extract**). I have no idea what the concentration is. According to multiple sources, cactus extract is supposed to be good for moisturizing, protecting, soothing, and firming. It‚Äôs also rich in antioxidants and fatty acids. Native Americans allegedly used cactus to treat burns.  (Side note: it‚Äôs also edible, and used in a variety of juices, jellies, alcoholic drinks, candies, and teas). Cactus extract contains Vitamin E, which helps soften skin, and Vitamin K, which helps reduce the appearance of dark circles and promote skin elasticity. It‚Äôs known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it good for sensitive skin. It‚Äôs also high in essential fatty acids. It‚Äôs thought to be suitable for all skin types and especially good for mature and sensitive skin. (There are too many articles here to list, but if you search for ‚Äúprickly pear‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpuntia ficus-indica stem extract‚Äù or ‚Äúcactus‚Äù and ‚Äúskin care,‚Äù you‚Äôll find a lot of interesting results.) Spoiler alert: using my own face as a test study, this ingredient lives up to all of its hype (except the dark eye circles, which I don‚Äôt have, so I don‚Äôt know how well it works on those). I could keep raving about this ingredient, but let‚Äôs move on so we can get to the actual product. \n\nAnother notable ingredient is **aloe barbadensis leaf polysaccharides**, which is a known anti-irritant and also helps restore suppleness. My sensitive skin loves aloe, so this is another plus for me. \n\nAnother good ingredient is **panthenol**, a humectant that‚Äôs an alcohol form of the B vitamin pantothenic acid.\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs **dipotassium glycyrrhizate**, which is a fancy way of referring to **licorice root extract**. As many of us licorice root fans know, licorice root is anti-inflammatory and an anti-irritant and has been known to work as a brightening agent and to help reduce the redness and irritation associated with rosacea and acne. I have mild rosacea, so I am thrilled that this ingredient is included. \n\n**Sodium hyaluronate**, a water-soluble salt form of our pal hyaluronic acid, is another winner. It has a smaller molecular size than hyaluronic acid, and thus is able to more easily penetrate the skin, and like HA, it is able to hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. There are many more great things I could say about this product, but most of us are familiar with the benefits of hyaluronic acid. \n\n**Sclerocarya birrea seed oil**, also known as **Marula oil**, is predominantly oleic acid, and it also contains stearic, linoleic, and palmitic acids. It is an antiaging oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates skin. \n\nSo as you can see, this toner is chock full of lots of great ingredients, and in spite of Cosdna‚Äôs flagging some of the ingredients for safety (which doesn‚Äôt concern me after doing my own research), nothing is flagged as being potentially irritating, and there‚Äôs only one potential acne trigger, with a rating of 2 (very low). That said, please remember that YMMV. \n\n*Packaging:*\n\nAqua Toner comes in a sleek 4.05 fl. oz./120 mL airless white pump that I think is made of plastic (at least on the outside). The only negative I would say about the container is that you can‚Äôt see how much product you have left, but I suppose the old flashlight trick would work. The product dispenses easily. \n\n*pH:*\n\nI tested the pH, and it comes out to about 5. Perfectly acceptable in my book for a hydrating toner, though probably too high to be a pH-adjusting toner. \n\n*Texture and fragrance:*\n\nThe product is a clear gel with a very faint scent‚Äîit‚Äôs hard for me to say what it smells like. I want to say ‚Äúcactus,‚Äù but I have no idea what cactus smells like. It strangely reminds me of the scent of Aussie Sprunch Spray in the purple bottle, but much lighter. I don‚Äôt find it overpowering or irritating, and it dissipates pretty quickly once the product is absorbed. I was surprised to see that the product is a gel, as it‚Äôs my first time to use a gel toner, but the gel quickly melts into the skin.\n\n*How to use:*\n\nThe instructions on the bottle read (in English): ‚ÄúUse morning and evening after cleansing. Take 2-3 pumps to a cotton pad and smooth over face and neck.‚Äù (The instructions on the box are in Chinese and say the same thing.) If you use a First Essence, you may wish to use the FTE first if you follow the ‚Äúthinnest to thickest rule.‚Äù At the same time, I have mixed feelings about this, as this product is a great booster for other products, so if you use the Aqua Toner first, your FTE might absorb better. You could play around with it and see what you prefer. Since it‚Äôs a gel, I don‚Äôt use a cotton pad, which seems like it would waste a lot of precious product‚ÄîI generally squirt a pump or two onto my hand and apply to one section of my face at a time, patting in with my fingertips, then moving onto the next section. I probably divide my face into three sections (so anywhere from 3-6 pumps of product used at one time), but then I apply the toner around my eye area as well. I‚Äôm liberal with it around my eyes because I‚Äôve had such amazing results, as detailed below. I use it both morning at night. The product absorbs pretty quickly, so you don‚Äôt have to wait too long to continue your routine. It might even absorb more quickly than other toners I‚Äôve used. \n\n*How I tested this product + my impressions:*\n\nI started testing this toner back in late February/early March, but when my skin broke out in hives due to an unrelated reaction from a hair product getting on my face, I had to reset my routine from zero and put this toner on hold. This meant I wasn‚Äôt using any toner for most of March, and in early April I only used Evian mist (pure water) as my toner. When it came time to add a proper toner back into my routine during the last third of April, I reached for the Aqua Toner, since my other sensitive skin toners (Acwell and Klairs) were near-empty, and the ingredients list looked pretty clean. I was quite apprehensive, since I was still haunted by memories of itchy, angry red hives, and I was afraid of a relapse. Fortunately, the Aqua Toner got along well with my skin and caused absolutely no negative reaction (no breakouts, no irritation, nada). \n\nI tested it about a week over my entire face, and I thought my skin seemed suppler, but to test my hunch, for a couple of days after, I only applied the Aqua Toner to the left side of my face, and I applied my almost-empty bottle of Whamisa Organic Flowers Deep Rich Essence Toner to the right side. The difference was palpable after a couple of days: my left side was softer, bouncier, and much more pleasant to touch, and my left cheek was less red and irritated (I have sensitive skin and mild rosacea, and my cheeks gets irritated just by existing). The right side of my face became very jealous from all the attention lavished upon my left, and so I aborted my split-face experiment before a week had elapsed‚ÄîI wanted that bounciness all over. \n\nThe more I use this product, the more I love it. I‚Äôve probably used it for about 3 ¬Ω weeks, not including my first testing round that was cut short due to hives. I still have a pretty minimalist routine (no ampoules/essences/serums except for my beloved Shark Sauce), but you‚Äôd never know it. I even stopped using my First Essence and am just using the Aqua Toner to prep my skin, and I still have The Glow (granted, Shark Sauce is probably also giving me The Glow, so maybe this comment is less about the Aqua Toner and more about the inefficacy of my current FTE). But the best thing is I have that Gym Mat Effect‚Äîdo you remember the mats you used in gym class when you did gymnastics? That‚Äôs how my skin feels: firm yet soft, and bouncy. QQ, as the Taiwanese say. Now, I have a couple of other products that help with the Gym Mat Effect (Shark Sauce, L‚ÄôHerboflore Flora Supreme Recovery Infusion Cr√®me), but when I feel my face after applying the Aqua Toner and before applying those other products, I still have the coveted Gym Mat Effect. I feel like a narcissist because I can‚Äôt stop touching my face. I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm single because someone else needs to be stroking my Gym Mat Face. \n\nAnother perk of this toner is that it helps to minimize the fine lines around my eyes. I‚Äôm in my 30s, and thanks to my oily T-zone, my forehead is still smooth, but I have pesky fine lines in the corners and underneath my yes. My eye cream helps a little bit, but this toner makes the lines almost non-existent (almost‚Ä¶you can still see they‚Äôre there, but they‚Äôre way less visible). The effect also gets better each day; the past couple of mornings, I‚Äôve awakened to a very smooth, almost line-free eye area, and it‚Äôs stunning. I can‚Äôt help but wonder what amazement would happen if I had a better eye cream to work in conjunction with this toner (I do have the eye cream in the same line, but I‚Äôm waiting to use up my lackluster Whamisa eye essence before I start the new product‚ÄîI hope the Aqua line eye cream won‚Äôt disappoint). This is where the toner exceeds my expectations: I expect my toner to hydrate and prep my skin for the additional goodness that‚Äôs going to come its way, and if I‚Äôm greedy, I might expect my toner to be soothing, and I definitely expect my toner NOT to irritate my skin, but it never occurred to me that I could expect my toner to help diminish the appearance of fine lines. I thought that‚Äôs what fancy serums were for. (Let‚Äôs be clear: the lines are still there, but my skin is so plumped with hydration that you can‚Äôt see them that well‚Äîafter all, this product doesn‚Äôt contain actives like retinol.) \n\nThe longer I use this product, the better results I see. The first couple of days I used it, I thought it was just an ordinary toner in a strange gel form, but now it‚Äôs my favorite step of my routine. Not only does the toner itself seem quite effective at soothing, firming, and hydrating, but moreover, I think it‚Äôs acting as a booster to make the products that I subsequently apply more effective. I swear my skin gets bouncier and more Gym Mat-esque each day. \n\n*Who might benefit from using this product:*\n\nI believe anyone would benefit, unless you have an allergy or sensitivity to any of the ingredients, in which case, please stay far away. L‚ÄôHerboflore‚Äôs Facebook page implies that it‚Äôs suited to all seasons and all skin types (of course they want to sell product, so why not say that?). I think the people who would see the most results are probably people who are in need of some serious hydration (dehydrated and/or dry skin types) and people who are concerned about anti-aging. I have sensitive combination skin, and it doesn‚Äôt make my T-zone oily, and my usually dry and sensitive cheeks aren‚Äôt dry and are less sensitive. Some of the ingredients are supposed to be helpful for reducing inflammation and acne, so it might also be a useful product to someone who is acne-prone. I‚Äôm not sure how someone with oily skin would react to this product, especially during hot and humid weather. As I said, it doesn‚Äôt make my T-zone oilier, but I think I‚Äôm less oily than many, and I know some people prefer to use a toner that helps to control oil. Moreover, the weather hasn‚Äôt been that hot since I‚Äôve starting using the toner. \n\n*How does it stack up to other toners?*\n\nFor comparison, the three hydrating toners I‚Äôve used in the past year are the above-mentioned Whamisa toner, the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner (original version before the upgrade), and the Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner. The Whamisa is too rich for my skin, especially in summer, and as I discussed previously, it doesn‚Äôt give my skin that Gym Mat feel that the Aqua Toner does. I find the Klairs toner very soothing, but nowhere near as hydrating as the L‚ÄôHerboflore. As for the Acwell toner, I like using it to wipe off residue from Vitamin C or other actives, and the L‚ÄôHerboflore definitely doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúcleansing‚Äù aspect. The Acwell didn‚Äôt soothe my skin as much as the Klairs toner, and it wasn‚Äôt as hydrating for me as either of the other two. (I‚Äôll probably repurchase the Acwell however to have on hand for post-actives cleansing.) \n\n*Where to get this product, and how much will it cost you?*\n\nAs I mentioned, I purchased my bottle from the U.S. retailer [Beautibi](https://www.beautibi.com/collections/lherboflore/products/lherboflore-aqua-plus-moisturizing-toner), where it costs US $48. Beautibi does ship internationally. (And to reiterate, I am not shilling for this site. I love the curation, but I gain nothing by you shopping there. In fact, if you do buy the toner there, that‚Äôs one less bottle for me to buy.   )  I have not found any other North American retailer that sells this product. \n\nIf you live in Taiwan, China, Malaysia, or Singapore (I believe Singapore has a physical L‚ÄôHerboflore stand, but maybe it‚Äôs only online ordering), you can visit a L‚ÄôHerboflore stand in person or probably order online (for example, in China, you can order L‚ÄôHerboflore off of Taobao‚ÄîI‚Äôm not sure if Taobao ships internationally). According to the official L‚ÄôHerboflore site, the toner retails for NTD $1500, which is about US $45 (so you can see that the Beautibi markup is not that big). I included the Chinese name of the product above in case you want to do an Internet search, which might turn up more possible places where you can purchase it. \n\n*My rating:*\n\n**Five out of five buckets of snail slime and bee spit**, in spite of the fact that Cosdna thinks it might kill me, and in spite of the fact that it‚Äôs the priciest toner I‚Äôve ever purchased. I‚Äôm apprehensive to give a product such a high rating, since skin care varies so much by person, but this product continues to impress me each day. Maybe I‚Äôm having such good results because my hive outbreak left my face dry, flaky, and in such bad shape that things could only get better, but that makes the product even more impressive to me, since when I started using this product the second time around, my skin was still hypersensitive. I‚Äôll definitely repurchase, though I have the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù Klairs toner in my closet that I‚Äôll need to try first. \n\nI‚Äôll be reviewing three other L‚ÄôHerboflore skin care products in the coming week (two others from the Aqua line, one from the Flora line), so we‚Äôll see if the rest stack up. So far, I am very excited about the brand and about T-Beauty, and I regret that I didn't buy one of everything that L‚ÄôHerboflore sells when I had the chance in person. \n\n*Final disclaimer:*\n\nIt concerns me that someone could read this and drop almost $50 on a product that potentially doesn‚Äôt work for him/her, so if you choose to purchase this toner, please do so at your own risk. Remember that what gives one person a Gym Mat Face could give another person a dermatological nightmare. \n",

    "body": "Since I've been having a hard time finding reviews for foreign products (I'm in the USA) I thought I would review one and possibly help someone else out! This review is for [Av√®ne Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-cleanance-sun-care-spf-50-50ml/22947.html) I purchased this from Cocooncenter, a website that ships European products to loads of different countries!\n\n**My skin for reference:**\n\nExtremely oily, dehydrated, sensitive, not particularly acne-prone. My morning routine while trying this was just CeraVe foaming cleanser, Cosrx Centella toner, and this sunscreen.\n\n**Product name:** \n\nAv√®ne Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ (50ml) - $13.62 USD before shipping from Cocooncenter.\n\n**Product type:** \n\nDaily use sunscreen\n\n**Product description:** \n\ntaken directly from the website - \"Av√®ne Cleanance Sun Care SPF 50+ is a cream of very high protection specially formulated for oily to acne prone skin exposed to intense sunlight. This cream contains a photo-protective active complex which insure a high protection against all of the solar radiation UVB and UVA long and short. It also contains a powerful antioxidant, as well as monolaurin which allows to matify the skin thanks to its seboregulator action. Its light and fluid texture protects, moisturizes, and matifies the skin without leaving any white effect after its application.\"\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nThis sunscreen is advertised as silicone and paraben free, and it also happens to be free of alcohol, oxybenzone, octinoxate, and most other American filters (contains avobenzone). This sunscreen would be considered reef safe to Hawaii's standards. Its filters are Tinosorbs M & S, Uvasorb HEB, and Avobenzone.\n\nAvene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Methylene Bis-Benzatriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol [Nano], Cetearyl Isononanoate Water (Aqua), Disopropyl Adipate, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Decyl Glucoside, Glyceryl Laurate Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Benzoic Acid, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Glyceryl Behenate, Glyceryl Dibehenate, Hydrogenated Palm Glycerides Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Glycerides, Propyl√®ne Glycol, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl, Glucoside, Tribehennin, Xanthan Gum, Zinc Gluconate. \n\n**My opinion:** \n\nI wore this sunscreen for about a month before quitting (about three weeks ago). This sunscreen is quite matte. Definitely the most matte alcohol-free sunscreen I've ever tried. It is a thin lotion, but because of the high concentration of Tinosorbs it is slightly sticky and doesn't rub in very well. Once it dries, the stickiness is greatly reduced. It is a matte upon application, and stays matte for a few hours, but it is not \"mattifying\" in that it doesn't prevent my oil from shining through the sunscreen later in the day. I get greasy eventually, but it is still much better than any other sunscreen.\n\nIt leaves a slight white cast, mainly in streaks where I couldn't completely rub it in. After it completely dries, the white cast is mostly gone. It just stays white in patches around my nose and near my hairline. For reference, I am extremely pale, lighter-than-the-lightest-shade-of-foundation pale, so it would definitely show up white on anyone dark.\n\nThe sunscreen is very fragranced, and I can smell it all day long unless I apply makeup over it. It definitely irritates my senses and makes my skin itch when first applied. If you are sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this sunscreen. It didn't break me out, and is advertised for acne skin, so I can assume it will be safe for people who are acne prone. I ended up quitting on this sunscreen because I was too sensitive to the fragrance and couldn't wear it out of the house without foundation to hide the streaks.\n\n**Overall Rating:**\n\nI would rate this sunscreen 6.5/10 - it is matte, which I like, and it is free of alcohol/octinoxate/oxybenzone etc., which are big plusses. The cons, that kinda outweigh the pros, are that it is fragranced, slightly streaky, and difficult to rub in. I would not repurchase this sunscreen, it is just too expensive to ship for a very small/mediocre product. \n\n**Additional mini-review: Av√®ne Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick**\n\nThis SPF lip balm is AMAZING. Definitely the best lip balm I've tried with sun protection included. It uses the Tinosorbs and Avobenzone as filters. It has no nasty sunscreen taste, no weird texture. It's high protection to keep your lips safe from UVA. The only cons I have are that it's quite matte, and I prefer shiny lip balms. You could easily apply lip color on top of it for a day out. It also contains fragrance, but I don't notice it whatsoever. I give this a 9.5/10.\n\n[Av√®ne Sun Care Lip SPF 30 Lip Stick - $6.33 USD / 3g](https://www.cocooncenter.co.uk/avene-sun-care-lip-spf-30-lip-stick-3g/12848.html) - Ingredients: Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (Ricinys Communis Seed Oil), C 12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Dipentaerythrityl Tetrahydroxystearate/Tetraisostearate, Ozokerite, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Beeswax (Cera Alba), Myristyl Lactate, Dimethicone, Esters, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Bis Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax (Cera Carnauba), VP/Hexadecene Copolymer, Octocrylene, Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene Aqua), BHT, Decyl Glucoside, Parfum (Fragrance), Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol, Propylene Glycol, Silica, Titanium Dioxyde, Tocopheryl Glucoside, Aqua, Xanthan Gum.\n\n**Overall, I feel that if you have oily, acne-prone skin that is not sensitive to fragrance and can handle a slight white cast, you could like this sunscreen. Most people would like the lip balm!**\n\nEdit: added some info",

    "body": "Hey so I haven't been using this long enough to give a true review, but I know a lot of you guys were curious and I think I've actually already started noticing results so I wanted to report back!! This post is heavy on the ~product analysis~ front, so if you're super not into that, skim until the 2nd to last paragraph for results lol  \n\nSo first off if you don't know about \"The Ordinary\" line, mosey over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/50fb1j/psa_we_need_to_talk_about_this_new/) to read about it!   \n\nAlright so I picked up the niacinamide serum ([$6!!](http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-30ml)) and began using it twice a day on September 4, which means I'm closing in on a week of use. I have wanted to add a high-niacinamide product to my routine for a while (I was looking at 5%, which research says is most effective, but I was happy to use the 10% more like a booster and mixing into things - if anything that makes it an even BETTER value b/c it'll last even longer! haha) - for PIH and for general skin barrier function benefits. I was actually a little uncertain about the inclusion of zinc b/c the description talks about its sebum control benefits, and I actually have skin on the drier end. But if zinc PCA is anything like sodium PCA, it should be more humectant than drying, so perhaps its sebum control is more of the \"balancing\" variety....      \n\nHere are the ingredients: Aqua (Water), 10% Niacinamide, 1% Zinc PCA, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Pentylene Glycol, Carrageenan, Acacia Senegal Gum, Xanthan Gum, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.   \n\n++Of note is the carrageenan, a stabilizing ingredient that is derived from algae and thus potentially comedogenic. This ingredient put me off a bit; however, we know it is less than 1%, so I decided to plow ahead with full face testing lol. If you are more acne prone or have used this ingredient with issues in the past, by all means patch test - I was just too lazy/excited :-/     \nedit to add: you will see that they post a long winded explanation/justification on the product page for the inclusion of carrageenan. it's pretty irrelevant so do ignore it lol. carrageenan is used in food as well, and there are some natural food blogs screaming about how bad it is to consume, and THAT is what Deciem is referring to. that, however, is NOT why ppl think it's comedogenic. it's potentially comedogenic b/c it's derived from algae. has nothing to do with inflammation upon consumption. so, total strawman. I think Deciem is an interesting brand but they say and do a lot of stuff that really makes me scratch my head. (recommendations against chemical exfoliants being another thing. they recommend retinoic acid but not something way gentler like BHA? ehh)       \n\nA little about my skintype: I've had mild to moderate comedonal acne for years, and had one of the biggest flareups of my life around this past January. It wasn't until a generous + rigorous use of escalating BHA products throughout July and August that I finally purged it all out and stabilized ##knock on wood## I didn't *plan on* testing ANY new products until I was certain I was in the clear. I ordered the Deciem stuff thinking I would test it in a few weeks when I was more sure.     \n\nThen I ended up doing a mask that really irritated my skin lol. I had known for a couple weeks that I was on the cusp of overexfoliation / damaged moisture barrier, but I was also like SO CLOSE to being totally done purging, so I didn't give my skin the break it probably needed. Anyway, I got some bad dermatitis in places I'm very prone to it and I cleared it out w/ Aquanil HC (a hydrocortisone based lotion cleanser), but I also wanted to speed up my overall recovery process so I could go back to using BHA :-/ I was feeling paranoid about going off for 4 days! So I decided to start testing out the niacinamide. << This paragraph just to give the context to say... my good results are at least partially due to my finally giving my skin a much-needed break from chemical exfoliation\n\nSo yeah anyway, back to the Deciem serum. It's a highly viscous serum, I posted how when I received it (SUPER rapid & free shipping, btw) it arrived super bubbly - I haven't had serums arrive like this before probably b/c I usually use waterier stuff (#ABlyfe) Also note that although it's quite thick, that's purely just the texture, it's not emollient or anything - see how the ingredients show that the only ingredient above 1% is niacinamide, it's a mostly-water product!      \n\nFor this reason, and b/c it's a super-high 10%, and also b/c I want to further dilute out the ingred I'm scared of, I mix it 1:1 with a hydrating toner or essence (I use 2 drops, which usually corresponds to more than 2 drops of a watery product b/c it's so thick!). Hada Labo lotions work well, I've also done it w/ CosRX Galactomyces and Tosowoong sparkle ampoule. I've read complaints about the PC niacinamide booster being too watery, and this definitely doesn't have that problem! I apply this twice a day at some point in my hydration steps (usually this order: wash face / galactomyces on damp skin / niacinamide / cosrx snail 96. I have tried it after the snail as well, but I think I like using it underneath a little more. nbd tho)    \n\nAnyway, in the week since I have started using the niacinamide, I have DEFINITELY noticed an improvement in my skin tone and texture. It feels softer & smoother and just generally looks a little brighter and less red (it's one of those things where you never think your skin is red but once your skin is less red you realize there IS a difference haha. I realize now I've always had a little redness in my cheeks). I started noticing these effects only a few days in, and I don't think my own skin can do that so quickly just through removal of irritants - i.e., I do think this product is responsible for at least some of the good results. My skin has also been a lot less thirsty, but I would prob attribute that benefit more to the break from BHA's. Zero noticeable effects on PIH, and I would be gobsmacked if I did have any results after 6 days! And no undue dryness from the zinc, which I was a tiny bit worried about   \nUPDATE 9/12: with each passing day I'm more and more excited by the changes in my skin. it's seriously so much happier looking and feeling. those tiny dehydration striations are gone, pores look maybe more refined? and most importantly, my skin is so much less dry, and while I first chalked this up to the lack of chem exfoliation, even after using BHA 3x in the past week my skin is still calm. fingers crossed these improvements last! I suspect I'll plateau soon, will update in one week!    \nFinal update: this gave me crazy improvement of my skin texture + tone in a few days. I stopped using it after ~2 wks b/c I started breaking out a bit and I got spooked it was the cause, though I still don't really have proof that it was (some other factors in flux at the time, such as decreased BHA usage). Since then though I've switched to DIY niacinamide stuff (I only bought the serum to tide me over until the weather was cool enough for me to order a batch of DIY ingredients - otherwise I absolutely would've given it another test run to confirm if it broke me out), which TBH hasn't given me as drastic results, but that could be entirely b/c I already improved so much already      \n\nIf you have been interested in niacinamide for a while, I think this is an awesome product to test it out. Even if you already know you love it, this is a simple and cheap product with a really high percentage! Personally I wouldn't use it full strength, and anyway it's easier to put on if you sheer it out a bit. But yeah, if anyone else has used this please chime in too!",

I have 4% azelaic acid, 0.05% tretinoin, and 4% niacinamide. I'm not sure what the azelaic acid accomplishes, but I know I want the retinoid and the niacinamide.

It doesn‚Äôt take Einstein to figure out all the products from Avant are crap, even if this were $5 it would still be crap. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the ingredients, its just the formulation and ingredients for the moisturizer isn‚Äôt worth more than $5, it has no high levels of any active ingredients/patented technology (almost all moisturizers at that price point has patents). If this were ingredients for a dollar store hand cream, then i would buy it, unfortunately it‚Äôs $134.  Avant products AREN‚ÄôT EVEN WORTH the $12 Boxycharm add on/pop up price.\n\nLook at the ingredients for Acure Radically Rejuvenating Whipped Night Cream ($15.99 on iherb.com) \n\nWATER/AQUA/EAU, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL OLIVATE, SORBITAN OLIVATE, SCLEROCARYA BIRREA (MARULA) SEED OIL, NYMPHAEA ALBA ROOT EXTRACT, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-1, SH-OLIGOPEPTIDE-2, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-1, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-9, SH-POLYPEPTIDE-11, COPPER PALMITOYL HEPTAPEPTIDE-14, HEPTAPEPTIDE-15 PALMITATE, PALMITOYL TETRAPEPTIDE-7, PALMITOYL TRIPEPTIDE-1 (PEPTIDE BLEND), FERULIC ACID, ASCORBIC GLUCOSIDE (VITAMIN C), COCONUT ALKANES, PSEUDOALTEROMONAS FERMENT EXTRACT (GLACIAL GLYCOPROTEINS), SALICYLIC ACID COCO-CAPRYLATE/CAPRATE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ASPARTIC ACID, LINOLEIC ACID, LINOLENIC ACID, LECITHIN, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SORBITAN ISOSTEARATE, LACTIC ACID/GLYCOLIC ACID COPOLYMER, CURCUMA LONGA (TURMERIC) ROOT EXTRACT, SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE CALLUS CULTURE EXTRACT.\n\nBesides the fact that this has way more antioxidants/age prevention/hydrating ingredients.  This ingredients list for a $16 moisturizer might look familiar to some people because it‚Äôs like 95% the same as a certain Drunk Elephant Moisturizer(it‚Äôs just missing a few amino acids at the end of the ingredients list but all the important ingredients are exactly the same, even the peptides are the same).  Looks a thousand times better than all the crappy $130 Avant Moisturizers, and this is just one example, there‚Äôs CeraVe, Elf, tons of Korean brand moisturizers, all around or under $20. \n\nDECIEM‚Äôs hand cream $16 for 100ML\nAqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Copper Lysinate/Prolinate, Plantago Lanceolata Leaf Extract, Methylglucoside Phosphate, Proline, Alanine, Serine, Pseudoalteromonas Ferment Extract, Tremella Fuciformis Sporocarp Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Cellulose, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Sodium Phosphate, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool.\n\nThere‚Äôs copper peptide (the next big thing in anti aging), snow mushrooms, amino acids, algae ferment, and Plantago Lanceolata which can reduce dark spots, all this from a hand cream, people were using this as a facial moisturizer cos it‚Äôs that good. \n\nMoisturizers which are around $134\n\n- Guerlain‚Äôs Abeille Royale Creams (has patent on formulas and also the frigging jar the moisturizer comes in) \n\n* Sisley Black Rose Cream Mask (really this needs no introduction) \n\n* Charlotte Tilbury‚Äôs Night Cream\n\n* Dior Capture Totale Firming and Wrinkle Correcting Cream (Again patented formula, with a lot of research and clinical trials)\n\n* Lancer Skincare the Nourish (Dr. Lancer dermatologists for Hollywood Stars) \n\n* Fresh Creme Ancienne Moisturizer (Literally made by hand in a Monastery in Europe) \n\n* Chanel Le Lift Restorative Cream (clinical and in vitro testing, patented formula) \n\n* Caudalie Premium Cru Rich/Normal Cream (again patented formula, developed with Harvard Medical School) \n\n* If you check out CultBeauty the Eve Lom holiday set (the one with the Moisture Cream and cleanser (all full size) are basically the same RV as the stupid Avant moisturizer. \n\nThe list can go on forever, also Anti pollution micellar water from Chanel only costs $45. If you take a look at the ingredients for Avant‚Äôs Micellar Water it‚Äôs missing a very crucial ingredient that the majority of ‚Äúhigh end/effective‚Äù micellar water contain, PEG-6 Caprylic/ Capric Glycerides.  Seriously this is not even worth $1. \nLastly someone from this subreddit did some research on this company, I think she concluded it was being used to launder money. But the fact that they‚Äôre selling you crap for $100+ is enough proof for me.\n\nNow the 111skin products we get from boxycharm or Ipsy are NOT the same as the ones sold in retail stores or 111skin‚Äôs online site.  The hydra gel moisturizer that came from Ipsy for example has a completely different ingredients list from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù moisturizer.\n\nIngredients from 111skin Cryo Activating Hydra Gel Ipsy version: \nAloe Barbadensis Gel, Glycerin, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Butylene Glycol, Isohexadecane, Dipropylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond / Amande Douce) Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Betaine, Lecithin, Pyrus Malus (Apple / Pomme) Fruit Water, Allantoin, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Hydroxyacetophenone, Trehalose, Propanediol, Glyceryl Caprylate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Aluminium Dicetyl Phosphate, BHT, Tetrasodium EDTA, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Citric Acid, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Achillea Millefolium (Yarrow / Achill√©e) Extract, Xanthan Gum, Menthol, Menthyl Lactate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Fragrance / Parfum, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Citronellol, Linalool.\n\nIngredients from 111skin‚Äôs site for the Hydra Gel:\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, NELUMBO NUCIFERA (LOTUS) ROOT WATER, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERIN, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND / AMANDE DOUCE) OIL, SODIUM ACRYLATES COPOLYMER, CARBOMER, TETRAHEXYLDECYL ASCORBATE, ETHYLHEXYL PALMITATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, BETAINE, LECITHIN, PROPANEDIOL, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HORDEUM VULGARE (BARLEY / ORGE) SEED EXTRACT, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PRUNUS PERSICA (PEACH / P√äCHE) JUICE, PYRUS MALUS (APPLE / POMME) JUICE, TRITICUM VULGARE (WHEAT / BL√â) SEED EXTRACT, DISODIUM EDTA, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, TRIHYDROXYSTEARIN, ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (YARROW / ACHIL√âE) EXTRACT, SODIUM HYALURONATE, MENTHOL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, ALOE VERA LEAF EXTRACT, GLYCERYL UNDECYLENATE, MENTHYL LACTATE, XANTHAN GUM, GLUCOMANNAN, FRAGRANCE / PARFUM, BENZYL SALICYLATE, LIMONENE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL.\n\nSee the difference? The Ipsy one although it advertises that it‚Äôs made with lotus water, there‚Äôs no lotus anything in the ingredients. It‚Äôs full of texture enhancers and solvents, IMO they were mainly trying to copy the ‚Äúgel texture‚Äù of the real moisturizer.  The real moisturizer that‚Äôs $200 isn‚Äôt that much better. No expensive ingredients or actives....Check out the Rovectin Lotus Water Cream, made from 75% lotus flower extract (I‚Äôm assuming extracts holds a lot more nutrients than lotus root water), and it‚Äôs $20 but it goes on sale for $10, has similar light texture etc etc.  Usually the ‚Äúmade for beauty boxes 111skin products‚Äù will have ‚ÄúMade in China for 111skin‚Äù on the packaging. The real products use to be made in Bulgaria and now I think it‚Äôs made in UK, and some are made in the US.  Even if the ingredients line up like the 111skin vitamin c serum from Ipsy and the old formula of the vitamin c from 111skin‚Äôs site, the texture, colour, smell are completely different.  The real one had a serum like texture, transparent, had some kind of smell (I forgot the smell, I compared the products like a year ago).  The Ipsy version has the texture of water, yellow tint, no smell I think. Even the real products from 111skin are total ripoffs...what the hell does that say about the ‚Äúfake‚Äù ones? \n\nTL:DR - both Avant and 111skin products are crap, 111skin sends out fakes to beauty boxes but even the real products are crap.  Avant is a sketchy company and their products aren‚Äôt even worth the $12 add on price.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if Avant‚Äôs website looks legitimate, every MLM website looks a thousand times more legitimate than Avant but it‚Äôs still a scam.",

Since then I‚Äôve found some products that work really well for me and which haven‚Äôt been mentioned on this sub before, so I decided to share my shelfie and write some reviews.\n\nI'm happy to hear your opinion about the products or my routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skin type**\n\nDry and sensitive, some general redness, not acne-prone.\n\nMy skin reacts to most artificial fragrances and some essential oils. \n\nI also prefer to use products with ‚Äúnatural‚Äù ingredients and try to avoid parabens, PEGs, micro plastic and mineral oil as much as possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Products (from left to right):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch** \n\nINCI: AQUA, CENTAUREA CYANUS FLOWER WATER, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, GLYCERIN, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS HYBRID OIL, CETEARYL WHEAT STRAW GLYCOSIDES, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM BENZOATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, STEARIC ACID, XANTHAN GUM, TOCOPHEROL, LACTIC ACID\n\nPrice 11 ‚Ç¨ for 200ml, available at M√ºller drugstore in Germany\n\nThis gentle cleansing milk is one of my holy grail products. All other cleansers that I‚Äôve tried before where either super drying and/or made me break out. This one isn‚Äôt drying at all and yet leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Only on days when I wear a lot of makeup I need to do an additional oil cleanse. I like that the formulation is not too watery, so it‚Äôs easy to spread on my face. It doesn‚Äôt have a noticeable smell. The bottle lasts a long time for me, usually over 6 months even with daily use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme**\n\nINCI: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, ETHYLHEXYL STEARATE, CERA ALBA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, KAOLIN, ZINC OXIDE, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice 2 ‚Ç¨ for 50ml, available at Rossmann drugstore \n\nThis water free balm with oils and beeswax is a thick and oily formulation, similar to a cold cream. I sometimes use it on cold and dry winter days as a thin layer between my daytime moisturizer and sunscreen. I‚Äôm not sure if it truly qualifies as an occlusive cream, but in my experience it does help with preventing moisture loss in dry weather. It takes a while to get absorbed into the skin. A little goes a long way and when you apply too much your face is going to shine like crazy. I noticed that when I use this cream several days in a row my skin texture starts to feel a bit smoother than usual. The beeswax smell is nice too. It works well under makeup as long as you give it enough time to dry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dermaveel  (OTC pharmacy cream, made by HEEL)**\n\nINCI: ECTOIN\\*, AQUA, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL, HYDROXYETHYLCELLULOSE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, SQUALANE, TOCOPHEROL, OLEA EUROPAEA FRUIT OIL, HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, VANILLA PLANIFOLIA FRUIT EXTRACT, ALCOHOL DENAT., CARBOMER, SODIUM CARBOMER, RHIZOBIAN GUM, CORYLUS AVELLANA BARK EXTRACT, HYDROGENATED LECITHIN, C12-16 ALCOHOLS, PALMITIC ACID, CERAMIDE 3\n\n\\*Since this cream is a medical product, its active ingredient (Ectoin) is listed first, even though it‚Äôs not the main ingredient.\n\nPrice about 10 ‚Ç¨ for 30ml in online pharmacies \n\nSo this is a medical product for people with neurodermatitis that was recommended to me by my dermatologist. It has a thick, slightly oily consistency but doesn‚Äôt take too long to get absorbed into skin. The smell is slightly chemical. Its active ingredient, Ectoin, is supposed to protect skin cells from environmental stress factors and help with skin barrier restoration. It is also used in other products such as eye drops and nasal sprays.\n\nNow I don‚Äôt know enough about skincare to judge how solid the research behind this patented molecule is. When my skin was a bit over exfoliated a few months ago, my experience was that Dermaveel was in fact better at repairing my damaged skin barrier than other moisturizers that I tried.\n\nI only use this cream during the winter months; it‚Äôs too heavy for warm summer days, even for my dry skin. I use it as a daytime moisturizer a few times per week; I find it a bit too pricey for everyday use. Unfortunately it does sometimes pill up under my makeup foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Manuka Repair Creme/Miel de Manuka Cr√®me R√©paratrice (OTC pharmacy cream, made by French brand Comptoirs & Compagnies)**\n\nINCI: MEL, AQUA, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII BUTTER, MACADAMIA TERNIFOLIA SEED OIL, GLYCERYL STEARATE, SQUALANE,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE, LEVULINIC ACID, PHENETHYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, BISABOLOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM LEVULINATE, TOCOPHEROL, CITRIC ACID\n\nPrice about 10 ‚Ç¨ for 40ml in online pharmacies\n\nThe reason why I bought this was simply that I really wanted to try a Manuka product. It contains 40% GMO 300 Manuka Honey. This isn‚Äôt exactly the highest GMO rating, but it‚Äôs the best price-performance ratio I could find. Despite its 40% honey content it has an average moisturizer consistency, not sticky, dries fast. The smell is amazing! Very sweet, smells of honey and beeswax.\n\nWith my dry skin I found it not hydrating enough as standalone moisturizer, though it might work for normal to oily skin. I apply this in the evening (few times a week) in combination with my usual moisturizer (TO NMF). On the next morning my skin is smooth and soft; feels slightly exfoliated and overall texture seems to be improved. Manuka honey, or honey in general, is said to have exfoliating properties. Manuka also has anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial effects though I can‚Äôt really comment on that since I luckily don‚Äôt have any breakouts at the moment.\n\nOnce or twice I made the mistake to use the Manuka repair cream on the same evening as my AHA exfoliator- which resulted in slightly flakey skin on the next morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dado Sens Sun - Sonnencreme SPF 30**\n\nINCI: AQUA \\[WATER\\], DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, DIETHYLAMINO HYDROXYBENZOYL HEXYL BENZOATE (UVINUL A PLUS) , ALCOHOL, ETHYLHEXYL TRIAZONE (UVINUL T 150), BIS-ETHYLHEXYLOXYPHENOL METHOXYPHENYL TRIAZINE (TINOSORB S), GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXYL SALICYLATE (OCTISALATE), SUCROSE PALMITATE, DISTARCH PHOSPHATE, PANTHENOL, TITANIUM DIOXIDE (NON-NANO), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CANDELILLA/JOJOBA/RICE BRAN POLYGLYCERYL-3 ESTERS, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE, BENZYL ALCOHOL, XANTHAN GUM, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, SODIUM STEAROYL LACTYLATE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, BENZYLIDENE DIMETHOXYDIMETHYLINDANONE, ALLANTOIN, POLYHYDROXYSTEARIC ACID, SODIUM ALGINATE, CALCIUM ALGINATE, GLYCINE SOJA OIL \\[SOYBEAN\\], ALUMINA, STEARIC ACID, ECTOIN, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, LECITHIN, TOCOPHEROL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE\n\nPrice 20 ‚Ç¨ for 125ml, available at M√ºller, Douglas\n\nThis is my favourite sunscreen ever! Definitely a holy grail candidate. Sunscreens have always been a bit problematic for me, for two reasons: 1: I need to use a product without acrylates, which unfortunately are an ingredient in nearly every sunscreen formulation ever.  2: I‚Äôm a bit picky about sunscreen filters; I‚Äôd rather not use problematic filters like Octocrylene, Octinoxate, Oxybenzone and Homosalate. And now I finally found something that works for me!\n\nDado Sens Sonnencreme SPF 30 has a thick, creamy consistency, perfect for my dry skin but it is probably too much for oily skin. There is no noticeable white cast, however I‚Äôm pale as ghost anyway, so results might be different for darker skin tones. It leaves a small amount of shine but I‚Äôm not too bothered by this. Smell is slightly chemical (different from usual sunscreen smell) but not very strong.\n\nThe downsides are that it has only SPF 30 and contains alcohol. I don‚Äôt find it drying though. What I like best about it is that it has great filters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETYL ALCOHOL, PROPANEDIOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, GLYCERIN, SODIUM HYALURONATE, ARGININE, ASPARTIC ACID, GLYCINE, ALANINE, SERINE, VALINE, ISOLEUCINE, PROLINE, THREONINE, HISTIDINE, PHENYLALANINE, GLUCOSE, MALTOSE, FRUCTOSE, TREHALOSE, SODIUM PCA, PCA, SODIUM LACTATE, UREA, ALLANTOIN, LINOLEIC ACID, OLEIC ACID, PHYTOSTERYL CANOLA GLYCERIDES, PALMITIC ACID, STEARIC ACID, LECITHIN, TRIOLEIN, TOCOPHEROL, CARBOMER, ISOCETETH-20, POLYSORBATE 60, SODIUM CHLORIDE, CITRIC ACID, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, TRIETHANOLAMINE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, PHENOXYETHANOL, CHLORPHENESIN\n\nPrice 10 ‚Ç¨ for 100ml, available at Douglas\n\nI actually don‚Äôt want to write too much about this one, there are already tons of reviews on this sub. It has fairly good INCIs, doesn‚Äôt dry or break me out and is cheap ‚Äì that‚Äôs all that I want in a moisturizer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA**\n\nINCI: AQUA (WATER), LACTIC ACID, GLYCERIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, PROPANEDIOL, SODIUM HYALURONATE CROSSPOLYMER, TASMANNIA LANCEOLATA FRUIT/LEAF EXTRACT, ACACIA SENEGAL GUM, XANTHAN GUM, ISOCETETH-20, TRISODIUM ETHYLENEDIAMINE DISUCCINATE, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL GLYCOL\n\nPrice 7 ‚Ç¨ for 30ml, available at Douglas\n\nThis is the first acid exfoliator I ever bought, so I can‚Äôt really compare it to other products. After a short purging period it got rid of the tiny closed comedones I had all over my face within about 6 weeks.  I like it a lot and use it about twice per week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Timeless Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin C Serum**\n\nINCI: WATER, MAGNESIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE, ALOE BARBADENSIS, GLYCERIN, HYALURONIC ACID, MATRIXYL 3000‚Ñ¢, BENZYLALCOHOL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID\n\nThis is usually not available in Europe. I found it at my local TK Maxx store for 10 ‚Ç¨. Bought it because I wanted to try Vitamin C. The lightweight, watery formulation is nice. It doesn‚Äôt have any noticeable smell.\n\nI‚Äôve been using this for 8 weeks now and don‚Äôt really see any difference. When it‚Äôs empty I‚Äôm probably going to replace it with a more potent Vitamin C product from The Ordinary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Salthouse Totes Meer Therapie - Beruhigende Maske Akut** (Picture only shows lower half of sachet)\n\nINCI: AQUA, CELLULOSE GUM, GLYCERIN, PANTHENOL, PROPANEDIOL, MARIS SAL (DEAD SEA SALT), PROPYLENE GLYCOL, MAYTENUS MACROCARPA (CHUCHUHUASI) BARK EXTRACT, ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE POWDER, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT, CHAMOMILLA RECUTITA FLOWER EXTRACT, PHENOXYETHANOL, CITRIC ACID, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL ALCOHOL\n\nPrice 1.25‚Ç¨ for 2x7ml, available at DM drugstore\n\nThis is a gel mask with Dead Sea salt and other calming ingredients. It calms down irritated skin and reduces redness. Most of the time it doesn‚Äôt completely get rid of the redness, but there is a visible difference. A hydrating, oil free formulation which I think is suitable for all skin types. The smell is slightly sweet but otherwise neutral. As usual, one of those ‚Äúsingle-use‚Äù sachets is enough for at least three applications. It‚Äôs currently not a permanent part of my routine, but I use it whenever my skin gets irritated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Schaebens Augen & Lippen Maske**\n\nINCI: AQUA, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, SIMMONDSIA CHINENSIS SEED OIL, DIISOSTEAROYL POLYGLYCERYL-3 DIMER DILINOLEATE, GLYCERIN, CERA ALBA, ZINC STEARATE, ASCORBYL PALMITATE, CITRUS LIMON PEEL OIL, GLYCINE SOJA OIL, HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA WATER, PANTHENOL, RETINYL PALMITATE, TOCOPHEROL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, UBIQUINONE, ALCOHOL, BENZOIC ACID, CITRAL, DEHYDROACETIC ACID, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, HYDROGENATED PALM GLYCERIDES CITRATE, LACTIC ACID, LIMONENE, MAGNESIUM SULFATE, PHENOXYETHANOL, SORBIC ACID\n\nPrice 0.60‚Ç¨ for 4x1.5ml, available at DM, Rossmann\n\nThis is the only product with essential oils that I put on my face. It works surprisingly well for my sensitive skin. Even though it is advertised as an eye-and‚Äìlip mask and the instructions say to take it off after 10 mins., I use it as an overnight leave on mask for my whole face.\n\nIn the morning my skin feels plump and well hydrated. The mask reduces very fine lines overnight. Not permanently of course, but the effect does last at least a day for me.\n\nWhen I use this mask everyday my pores start to clog up after a while, so I make sure to not use it too frequently. 2 or 3 times a week is completely fine though. It‚Äôs also super cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Routine**\n\n**AM**\n\n\\-wash face with water\n\n\\- moisturizer: either TO NMF or Dermaveel\n\n\\- on cold days:  Rossmann Babydream extra sensitive Wind- und Wettercreme\n\n\\- sunscreen: Dado Sens  Sun Sonnencreme SPF 30\n\n**PM**\n\n\\- Cattier Sanfte Reinigungsmilch\n\n\\- one of the following:\n\n* TO NMF\n* TO LA 5% + TO NMF\n* Timeless HAC Serum + TO NMF\n* Manuka Repair Creme + TO NMF\n* Schaebens Augen und Lippen Maske as leave on overnight mask on whole face",

    "body": "Warning this post is a long one:\n\nSo I went to cancel my base box and saw that Boxycharm had already put some spoilers up for the upcoming pop up sale, (someone made a posted already with the items, so you can see it there) obviously the lovely 111SKIN item caught my eyes.  As of right now base on the price of $24, I‚Äôm incline to believe the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask shown on the picture would be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù 111SKIN item, made in the same factory in UK as the other 111SKIN items that gets sent to Saks, SpaceNK, CultBeauty, their actual website.  So yay no fake ‚Äúmade in China for 111SKIN‚Äù crap, where the ingredients for the same 2 products are miles apart and completely different (see my post on Avant and 111skin, if you‚Äôre interested). \n\nSo is the real 111SKIN made in UK Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask that has a RV of $200 worth it? Let‚Äôs have a look.  \n\nFor people who aren‚Äôt skincare nerds, a moisturizer/night mask (basically the same, especially this one since it tells you to apply on dry skin, I‚Äôm guessing 111SKIN wants you to use this instead of a moisturizer at night) should always contain these 3 different types of ingredients, occlusives, humectants, and emollients. (For more detailed info on these types of ingredients, read the long explanation at the end).  \n\nFor now I‚Äôll get to the short definitions\n\n- Occlusives are ingredients that form a seal around the skin and traps water in order to prevent transepidermal water loss.  Having hydrated skin is very important in age prevention.  Depending on the occlusive ingredient, it can also prevent irritants, pollution, dirt, etc from. coming in contact with the skin.  Common occlusive ingredients: sunflower seed oil, silicones, squalane, beeswax and carnauba wax, Shea, cocoa, mango butters, mineral oil (nothing wrong with mineral oil I go further into details about this later on), lanolin. \n\n- Humectants are ‚Äúcompounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.‚Äù (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information).  Common humectants used in moisturizers: glycerin, hyaluronic acid (and its many forms such as sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid etc), amino acids, hexylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, aloe vera.  \n\n- Finally we have emollient type ingredients, they are used in moisturizers to soften and smooth the skin, also it acts as a lubricating agent, if you have cracked and flaky skin emollients can help fill the the open spaces with fatty acids (lipids) and prevent water loss.  Now many occlusive ingredients are also going to be emollient ingredients as well (like beeswax and carnauba wax) common emollient ingredients used, borage seed oil, Shea butter, almond oil, avocado oil, caprylic/capric, triglyceride, cetyl alcohol, cholesterol. \n\nSo now we‚Äôve listed the 3 types of ingredients that make up moisturizers (obviously other types of ingredients like antioxidants, texture enhancer, preservatives etc are also in moisturizers but these 3 are the building blocks/foundation of any moisturizer).  \n\nIngredients of the 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask (ingredients list taken from 111skin.com):\n\nAQUA / WATER / EAU, GLYCERIN (a very good start, glycerin is one of the best humectants, and it‚Äôs the 2nd ingredient which probably means they are going for the gel like texture for this product), PANTHENOL (Vitamin B5, like glycerin it‚Äôs a great humectant.  Draws water from the air and from the deeper layers of the skin to the top layer so that it can plump out the skin thus wrinkles and fine lines look less visible and skin feels smoother.  Its also an excellent soothing ingredient, helping reduce inflammation, redness, irritation.  It helps to repair and strengthen the skin‚Äôs protective barrier and its a great antioxidant.), XANTHAN GUM (and here‚Äôs where the good for skin ingredients end, xanthan gum excellent thickening agent and texture enhancer It‚Äôll make formulas that‚Äôs too watery more gel like.  However the typical concentration of xanthan gum in products are between 0.1% to 0.5%, now this being the 4th ingredient means again 111SKIN wants a gel texture for this overnight mask, cos this is most likely 2 or 1%.  Xanthan gum is perfectly safe and natural it‚Äôs just a chain of sugar molecules), ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER (another ingredient used to thicken products/viscosity control.  Now the presence of xanthan gum in high concentrations, and now this ingredient makes me think the Meso Overnight Mask is mostly made of water hence why there‚Äôs all these thickening agents, even glycerin has a syrup like texture, so not watery), SODIUM ASCORBYL PHOSPHATE (a vitamin c derivative that‚Äôs very stable and is used in Olehenriksen‚Äôs Truth Serum, it‚Äôs an antioxidant and an active ingredient that should be the 2nd or 3rd on the list, as the 6th ingredient I‚Äôm guessing the concentration is below 1%, what is the point of having below 1% vitamin c derivative especially since they are less effective than vitamin c (Ascorbic acid) plus I don‚Äôt see any other powerful antioxidants in this product, yes there‚Äôs panthenol but that doesn‚Äôt require vitamin c derivative to boost its effectiveness, unlike having vitamin e will increase the effectiveness of vitamin c), NATTO GUM (created through the fermentation of a proprietary strain of bacteria (the safe kinds), not enough research on this one, may become a potent antioxidant), PHENOXYETHANOL (preservatives), SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE(another bloody ingredient that‚Äôs used to make something more viscous in texture, so basically it thickens the formula to form a gel, okay we get it 111SKIN you like gel textures), SODIUM HYALURONATE (wow a humectant, salt form of hyaluronic acid), PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL (an emulsifier that‚Äôs amber/yellowish in colour (and that‚Äôs the colour of the Meso Overnight Mask) its used to solubilized fragrances into water based formulas, it really seems like there‚Äôs a lot of water in this product), SORGHUM BICOLOR STALK JUICE (not much information on this one besides skin conditioning agent, soften and hydrates, maybe? But some sites will tell you that it‚Äôll tighten skin and creates a immediate lifting effect.  Again until I find a study or a ton of anecdotal evidence, I‚Äôll call bs on the tightening and lifting claims for now), ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN (preservative), SODIUM HYDROXIDE (a very alkaline pH adjuster), SODIUM BENZOATE (preservative against fungi, not strong enough to work by itself so it‚Äôs usually combined with the next ingredient, works best at acidic pH of 3-5, our skin‚Äôs natural pH levels are usually between 5.5 to 6.5), POTASSIUM SORBATE (preservative thats not strong and often is paired with the previous ingredient) PENTYLENE GLYCOL (a humectant, also makes product feel nice on the skin), HAMAMELIS VIRGINIANA (WITCH HAZEL) LEAF EXTRACT (antioxidant, antibacterial, not sure why it‚Äôs at the end of the ingredients list in such low concentrations), CAPRYLYL GLYCOL (it‚Äôs a humectant, but it‚Äôs mainly used cos of its ability to boost the effectiveness of other preservatives mainly phenoxyethanol, there are sure a lot of preservatives on this ingredient list), PARFUM / FRAGRANCE.\n\nSo here‚Äôs the breakdown of the $200 111SKIN Meso Infusion Leave On Overnight Mask. NO OCCLUSIVES, NO EMOLLIENTS, the best ingredient is the panthenol, but without any occlusive/emollients ingredients everything will evaporate right off the skin that also will take moisture from your own skin too!  After analyzing the ingredients list of this lovely $200 product I‚Äôm incline to believe it‚Äôs basically water.  I like the panthenol but La Roche Pasay Cicaplast Balm B5 is so better, and it also has a gel version, it‚Äôs also $15. \n\nSeriously wtf is 111SKIN thinking? I can‚Äôt even consider this as a moisturizer or serum or overnight mask or toner, I don‚Äôt know what kind of product this is....cos from looking at the ingredients it‚Äôs just water with panthenol and a lot of THICKENING AGENTS to get that gel texture.  \n\nBelow are more information on occlusives, humectants and emollients if you‚Äôre interested feel free to have a look: \n\nOcclusives are ingredients that form a physical barrier around your face so that all the moisture from serums and moisturizer won‚Äôt evaporate off the skin making it drier, you‚Äôll often hear dermatologists refer to this as transepidermal water loss (TEWL), for obvious reasons having a hydrated skin will contribute greatly to age prevention.  They also act as a shield protecting the skin from physical irritates, pollution, etc, think of occlusive ingredients as a saran wrap for your face or body, except it only traps the water and keep out irritates especially for people who have compromised skin barriers.  Some examples of widely used occlusives are: \n\n- Shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter \n\n- Petroleum jelly and by default mineral oil since it‚Äôs derived from petroleum, for reasons unknown the Clean Beauty Movement has demonized Vaseline (and mineral oil) and it‚Äôs been made out to be this monster that‚Äôll take your first born and use it as a sacrifice, but it‚Äôs still one of the best occlusive ingredients we have, quote from one study on moisturizers ‚ÄúPetrolatum in a minimum concentration of 5% reduces TEWL by more than 98% followed by lanolin, mineral oil, and silicones which only reduce TEWL by 20‚Äì30%.‚Äùobviously it‚Äôs less cosmetically elegant (it‚Äôs grease) but perfectly safe to use the molecules are too big to get into the skin that‚Äôs why it makes such a good barrier ESPECIALLY for people who suffer from compromised skin barrier issues (eczema, psoriasis etc) and when you‚Äôve messed up your skin barrier with too much retinol and exfoliating acids.  The new trend in Korea is I think called ‚Äúslipping‚Äù? Where people put on a layer of Vaseline before bed to stop TEWL.  As for people with oily skin maybe stay away from this one. \n\n- Squalane, soy, sunflower oil, lecithin\n\n- Cholesterol and ceramides (two important skin lipids that can be found in the famous Skinceuticals moisturizer 2:4:2 (the first 2 are two different ceramides, 4 is 4% cholesterol, and the last 2 are fatty acids, it looks like they used sunflower seed oil)\n\n- Beeswax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax\n\n- Lanolin, silicones \n\nSorry for rambling, next important class of ingredients are humectants, ‚Äúcompounds that attract and bind water. They can help hydrate the skin by drawing water from the deeper epidermis and dermis (layers of your skin) or from the air if the humidity is greater than 75%.‚Äù (Definition taken from National Centre for Biotechnology Information). Common humectants used are:\n\n- Glycerin \n\n- Propylene glycol (again the Clean Beauty Industry has labelled this one as antifreeze and brake fluid....long story short, it‚Äôs not and safe to use), hexylene glycol, butylene glycol.\n\n- Hyaluronic acid and it‚Äôs many forms, like sodium hyaluronate, sodium acetylated hyaluronate etc \n\n- Lactic acid, PHA (the acids that‚Äôs in Glow Recipe‚Äôs toner, or Olehenriksen‚Äôs Phat Mask) it‚Äôs a very gentle exfoliating acid and they also retain moisture. \n\n- Urea, amino acids \n\n- Aloe Vera \n\nFinally we get to last category of ingredients, emollient ingredients are used in moisturizer to make your skin soft and smooth like a new born baby (I wish it were that easy). They are usually lipids (fatty acids, which are super important to a healthy skin barrier) and oils,  a lot of occlusives are also emollients.  Common emollients found in moisturizers (some are also occlusives) \n\n- Lanolin \n\n- beeswax \n\n- Shea butter \n\n- Jojoba oil \n\n- Castor oil \n\n- Moringa seed oil \n\n- Linoleic acid\n\nTL:DR : even if the 111SKIN Overnight Mask in the pop up spoiler is real as in made in UK with all the other real products that‚Äôs going to be sold in Saks, CultBeauty, SpaceNK etc, it‚Äôs still junk, beyond junk, it‚Äôs basically water, and then a lot of ingredients to make the water into a gel, the ONLY beneficial ingredients are panthenol (vitamin B5), glycerin, and hyaluronic acid....seriously that‚Äôs it, all those ingredients are available in the Ordinary‚Äôs Hyaluronic Acid Serum.",

    "body": "Doing this review since I got a couple questions for it when I posted [my review of PC BHA 9](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1s2rpz/review_paulas_choice_resist_bha_9_for_stubborn/) and I feel it is another great product that deserves a solid review. Paula's Choice also has a [20% off antioxidant serums deal currently](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/), which makes it a great time to pick it up if you're interested!\n\n[The product](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/).\n\n**Claims**: \n\nRESIST C15 Super Booster is a concentrated, light-as-water liquid treatment product designed to supercharge your Paula's Choice serum, or it may be used alone. A blend of 15% stabilized vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) at a pH of 3.0, antioxidant vitamin E, ferulic acid, and peptides repairs visible signs of aging and stimulates collagen production for smoother, brighter, and firmer skin. \n\nVitamin C also helps protect skin from environmental damage as it evens your skin tone. You'll see dramatically younger, healthier, and more radiant skin in weeks!\n\n**Who is this product for?**\n\nRESIST C15 Super Booster is for anyone who wants to boost the results from their Paula's Choice serum or who wants to experience the benefits of vitamin C when combined with other proven anti-aging ingredients. The formula is suitable for all skin types and also appropriate for breakout-prone skin.\n\n**Ingredients**: \n\nWater, Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C/antioxidant), Ethoxydiglycol (slip agent/penetration enhancer), PPG-26 Buteth-26 (emulsifier), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (thickener), Tocopherol (vitamin E/antioxidant), Ferulic Acid (antioxidant), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin-repairing ingredient), Acetyl Octapeptide-3 (cell-communicating ingredient), Glycerin (skin-repairing ingredient), Panthenol (skin conditioning agent), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer/antioxidant), Triethanolamine (pH adjuster), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).\n\n**My skin type, in detail**: \n\nSensitive, very irritation-prone, dry-combination (dry cheeks, oily t-zone), very small pores, easily congested skin, stubborn acne spots. Responds well to BP spot treatments. Responds well to BHA and anti-inflammatories. Responds well to lactic acid (AHA). Responds okay to glycolic acid (AHA), can be irritating. Responds very poorly to tretinoin (retin-a, renova, adapalene). Many ingredients break me out (cetearyl, cetyl alcohol; natural oils; some fillers/thickeners).\n\n**My current routine as of Dec. 3, 2013**:\n\n* AM - Cleanse with [PC Hydralight Cleanser](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-One-Step-Cleanser/)\n* AM - Tone with [PC Hydralight Toner](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/collections/Hydralight/_/Hydralight-Healthy-Skin-Refreshing-Toner/)\n* AM - Pat on 3-5 drops [PC C15 Super Booster](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/antioxidants/_/RESIST-C15-Super-Booster/). Allow to absorb 5-10 minutes.\n* AM - Pat on pea-sized amount of [Elta MD PM Therapy](http://eltamd.com/product/pm-therapy-facial-moisturizer/) if feeling dry.\n* AM - Apply [Skinceuticals Physical Fusion](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/physical-fusion-uv-defense-spf-50.htm) is going out for extended periods of time (15m or more).\n* PM - Remove makeup or sunscreen with [Albolene](http://www.albolenecleanser.com/) or [Clinique TTDOB](http://www.clinique.com/product/1673/6424/Skincare/Cleansers_Makeup_Removers/Take-The-Day-Off-Cleansing-Balm/index.tmpl). If no makeup or SS, skip step.\n* PM - Proceed with normal AM cleanse/tone routine.\n* PM - Apply 2 drops of C15 to nose, cheekbones, under eyes.\n* PM - Mix 3 drops C15 with 1 squirt of BHA 9. Apply all over trouble areas (forehead, below cheekbones, jaw). Let absorb 10-15 minutes if possible.\n* PM - Pat on pea-sized amount of Elta MD PM.\n* PM - Pat on tiniest amount of Vaseline on driest spots, if needed.\n\n**Other skincare habits and details**:\n\n* I have taken Ortho Tri Cyclen for about 5 years now.\n* My diet isn't anything to write home to mom about. I enjoy fatty foods and red meats. I drink very little soda and consume virtually no sweets. \n* I sleep on a silk pillowcase.\n* I do not wash my pillowcase every night. I'm lucky if I remember to wash it once a week. Gross, I know.\n* I rarely talk on the phone, and when I do, you can bet my phone hasn't been wiped down with alcohol in the past week. Sorry, y'all.  \n\n**Review**:\n\nI have been using this product for roughly 1.5-2 months now. I first picked up a sample with my 2% BHA liquid re-order out of sheer curiosity. I had heard many good things about the product, from people like [Goss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaKI15KTTes) to [Veronica Gorgeois](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKOvcV6nnM) (who I do really like and feel gives pretty solid skincare advice, if you want an educated YouTuber). The sample is a bit larger than a normal sized perfume sample and lasted me about 7-10 days at 5 drops per day. \n\nAs a background, I have been using NuFountain 10% Vitamin C serum for roughly 6 months (20% was consistently too irritating for my skin and broke me out in tons of angry, red bumps). NuFountain's formula is very light and basic, consisting of essentially water, 10% L-AA (form of vitamin C), and glycerin. It feels a lot like water, but needs to be refrigerated due to the lack of preservatives and the unstable form of vitamin C. \n\nBy comparison, the Paula's Choice serum is a bit thicker than water, but not entirely gel-like. It is also a bit tacky once it is applied to the skin. Since I apply it after toning and before a moisturizer, it hasn't bothered me. It also becomes less tacky over time.\n\nThe packaging is also excellent. It comes in a box with the bottle dropper separate from the bottle itself (which is sealed, obviously). Inside the bottle is a bit of a seal so the product remains air-tight when not in use, which is excellent for an antioxidant serum where the antioxidants can become unstable and/or ineffective if exposed to oxygen too long. \n\nAlso, at $45 USD, this is a great dupe or replacement for the famous [$153 Skinceuticals CE Ferulic](http://www.skinceuticals.com/_us/_en/category/c-e-ferulic.htm) serum.\n\nNow, I cannot compare this product to the Skinceuticals product, since I have not used it myself. However, I can say that I have achieved much better results from this product as opposed to my NuFountain. While I like the NuFountain, it hasn't been a complete game-changer like the PC C15 has been. \n\nWithin my first 3 days of usage of the sample (in place of my NuFountain serum), I noticed I had bouncier, supple, healthier looking skin. My skin also felt a bit more moisturized -- a big deal for a dry skinned lady like myself that can't use a majority of fatty alcohols. \n\nMy glowy skin remained all while I used the product. It also became a bit more even-toned and my acne less inflamed. \n\nEventually, I ran out of the sample and went back to my NuFountain serum. Within 3 days or so, my skin returned to it's less glowy, less refined, drier, and not-quite-as-healthy-looking state. I ordered a bottle of the C15 and began using it as soon as it came in.\n\nWithin 3 days my skin's state while using the sample had returned. Healthy, vibrant, less angry looking. \n\nI'm almost 2 months in of consistent usage and my skin is still very healthy and glowy looking. Definitely a HG product for me. \n\n**Bottom line**: \n\nDo I recommend this? Yes, especially if you are looking for a good C serum without the enormous price tag and are not sensitive to tocopherol (vitamin E). \n\n**Other notes relating to this serum**:\n\n* [Ferulic acid and why you should consider adding it to your skincare routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1oovij/ferulic_acid_and_why_you_should_consider_adding/)\n\n---\n\nEdit: Paula's Choice now has a Refer-a-Friend program -- someone refers you, you save $10 on your first purchase. If you're interested in purchasing anything from PC, just contact someone in this sub or myself and we can send you a referral link. This stacks with free shipping offers and offer codes.",

    "body": "**Uhm, what the heck are you talkin' 'bout?**\n\nHi AB! I'm a super long time lurker, first time poster. I hope I've followed all the rules!\n\nHere is the deal:\n\nSo, I have been on the hunt for a daily mist that does more than just \"this makes my skin so hydrated throughout the day!\" That's nice and all, however the reality is: It **should be** hydrating as I'm literally spraying my face and saturating it with liquid. In most of the more famous \"thermal water\" mists, its literally just water and pressure.\n\n\n**a note** I'm not bashing water mists, I own one! I think they are great for what their purpose is, pure hydration. I just find it easier to put some bottles water in a fine mist spray bottle, tbh.\n\n\n**So, what are you getting at here?**\n\nI have skin that (like many of us here) isn't flawless, spotless perfection. So I have been on the hunt for a mist that does more than simply hydrate, be cause we all deserve a mist that can help us with skin problems too, right? I think that some of the issue is, when looking for a mist, we all just assume that **hydration is all we are supposed to get from a mist** & that just didn't sit right with me. I feel like we should at least get a little bit more. Whitening/brightening effects, acne control, sebum control, pore minimizer, etc. I wan't all a mist has to offer!\n\n\n**You said you were on a hunt, did you find anything? Or are you just smack talking?**\n\nThis is why I'm here. I found a few mists that I would like to share and hope to get some recommendations for more! I hope to compile some type of list, so any and all suggestions are welcome. I would especially love some mists from brands that we may not see that often because I'd love to broaden my horizons!\n\n\n**Here are the mists I found so far and their ingredients:** (I hope anyone can add to this)\n\n\n**BENTON Honest TT Mist**\n\nIngredients: Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tee Tree) Leaf Water, Sodium Hyaluronate, Melaleuca Alternifolia (Tea Tree) Extract, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Glycerin, Altharea Roea Root Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Beta-Glucan, Poly Glutamic Acid, Aspalathus Linearis Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Psidium Guajava Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract\n\n\n**ELENSILIA Escargot Botanic Garden Bee Venom Lavender Mist**\n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Sodium Citrate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil,Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1,2-Hexanediol, Panthenol, Sodium Chloride, Chlorphenesin, Adenosine, Magnesium Sulfate, Citric Acid, Glycosaminoglycans, Bee Venom, Honey Extract, Royal Jelly Extract, Propolis Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Polygonum Multiflorum Root Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Phellinus, Linteus Extract, Angelica Gigas Root Extract, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Paeonia Lactiflora Root Extract, Sophora Angustifolia Root Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Galactomyces, Ferment Filtrate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil\n\n\n**Snail White SYN-AKE Mist**\n\nIngredients: Snail secretion filtrate,deionized water, SYN-AKE (dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzalymide diacetate) Alpha arbutin, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid, Morus nigra fruit extract, rubus idaeus (raspberry extract) Prunus Avium (sweet cherry extract) fragaria vesca (strawberry fruit extract\n\nHonorable mention: I have **TFS Bamboo Water, sebum control mist.** I like it, it controls some oil, hydrates and doesn't have a strong scent.

It's probably the most finely-misted spray I've ever come across for anything though, but the issue with that is that it's *so fine* that it requires me to spray it continuously around my face for a good 5 seconds to get a good layer on, instead of just a few spritzes. Even so, the spray can lasts a long time.\n\nNon-AB, but I also have the **Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater** that's already popular, which I think works really well, but I'm not a fan of rose-scented things and it's very, very fragranced.\n\nAside from those two, I've heard good things from **Avene's Thermal Spring Water**, which is what I was planning on trying next.",

It has glycerin as a top ingredient, the same as Mac Fix+ which people use to \"foil\" or help shadows stay better.\n\nHope you enjoy! Just testing a theory! \n\n*DISCLAIMER AND WARNING*\n\nIdk if it's exactly eye proof. It says keep out of eyes, but you should really keep alot of crap out of your eyes. I use urban decay all nighter mixed with shadows and that says keep out of eyes. Also, if you use it as a primer, it could potentially get in your eye.\n\nSo.. FYI, don't squirt it in your eye unless you... Really want to?? \n\nI haven't used it on my eyes yet until I look at the ingredients a bit more thoroughly. I also am not advocating you to do so. I just had a thought and played a bit to test it! \n\nIngredient list to inform yourself:\n\n\"Ingredients:\nWater, Glycerin, Isopropyl Palmitate, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tapioca Starch, Triceteareth-4 Phosphate, Maltodextrin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Fragrance.\"\n\n\nEDIT: \n\nFIX+ ingredients if you're curious!\n\n\"Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caffeine, Panthenol, Arginine, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol\"",

    "body": "I had been wanting to try the old NR FTE for a long time, but it was discontinued earlier this year. Since I really liked the white vita capsule essence, I decided to take a chance on the white vita first essence after my Missha FTE intensive ran out. Since I haven't seen reviews for this product, I figured it would be good to post one myself.\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is extremely dehydrated. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. My main concerns are keeping my skin hydrated, fading PIH, decreasing redness, and acne prevention. For reference, here is my full routine:  \n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)  \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)  \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nNR white vita first essence  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence  \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nDr. Jart ceramidin cream    \n\nIngredients: Saccharomyces ferment (edited to add: 87.8%), methylpropanediol, propanediol, niacinamide (2%), betaine, phellinus linteus extract, articum lappa root extract, dioscorea japonica root extract, pancratium maritimum extract, nymphaea alba flower extract, olea europaea (olive) leaf extract, sodium hyaluronate, argania spinosa kernel oil, hydrogenated lecithin, 1,2-hexanediol, peg-40 hydrogenated castor oil, water, glycerin, sodium citrate, bifida ferment lysate, ethylhexylglycerin, citric acid, polyquaternium-51, glycosyl trehalose, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, raffinose, biosaccharide gum-1, butylene glycol, lecithin, dipropylene glycol, sodium palmitoyl proline, bisabolol, acetic acid, lactic acid, dicaprylyl carbonate, ascorbyl glucoside, zinc pca, sucrose distearate, ceramide np, retinyl palmitate, bioflavonoids, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, hesperidin, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, potassium sorbate  \n\nTexture: The first essence is a runny liquid, but has a slight viscosity to it when compared to water. It isn't as runny as the Missha FTE. It sinks in well and provides light hydration, definitely more hydrating than the Missha. The first essence has the same light fragrance as the white vita capsule essence.  \n\nEffect: Glow! The NR first essence has given my skin much more glow than the Missha FTE did. In addition to the glow, the NR has helped with reducing PIH (the Missha had no effect on PIH). My white vita capsule essence was already doing a good job of lightening PIH, and using the first essence along with it has boosted the speed at which the PIH fades. I'm really glad I took a chance and tried the white vita first essence.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "Winters means chilly winter winds, low humidity, dry indoor heat, lowered thirst, reduced perspiration, hot showers, friction from itchy - thick clothes and perpetual dryness. Winters means dryness & cracked lips for me.\n\n[LIPPSSSSS](https://preview.redd.it/5phvc72etx661.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a379572e84286d26fce0b36539b61233412ec8)\n\nThe prime way to fix dry lips is to increase your water intake. Lips are an extension of the throat and if you tend to often lick your lips subconsciously, it is your body's indication that it needs more water. Take my advice, I don't listen to it anyway. It is not easy to increase your water intake overnight. I struggle with drinking an adequate amount of water. A good lip product is my saviour from Sahara lips.\n\nI am ranking these lip products in order of preference.\n\n***1. Bakson's Sunny Lip Balm - ‚Çπ40***\n\nThank you @ for introducing me to this small wonder.\n\nDon't be misguided by the packaging. This lip balm is much more than your basic vaseline; It's the vaseline killer. This inexpensive lip balm provides the ideal balance of moisturisation, emollience and occlusiveness. The ingredient list is stellar. This lip balm does not just sit on my lips and lock moisture, but it also conditions my lips. It glides on my lips in a thin layer and you can immediately feel it emollize my lips. It keeps my lips hydrated for longer. I definitely need to reapply during the day but it provides immediate comfort to dry and cracked lips. Within 2-3 days of religious use, my lips are completely healed. This is the perfect lip balm to throw - in your bathroom, car, pocket, bag, and at your *'Sun yaar lip balm denaa?'* friends.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Petrolatum, Lanolin Anhydrous, Shea Butter, Souabran Glycerides, Bees Wax, Almond Oil, Vitamin E, Distillates of Aloe vera & Calendula, B.H.T., Sorbic Acid, Perfume.*\n\nAdditional tip: Lanolin makes for a great nipple balm. It is prescribed to pregnant & lactating mothers. If you suffer from dry nipples, you can use this lip balm to perk 'em up to life.\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***2. Unpa Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule - $6***\n\nIt would be on the top of my list had its competitor not been 1/10th of its price. Its name can certainly raise eyebrows, but this one packs a punch. I was pleasantly surprised by this random buy. The texture is like honey, but it is not at all sticky or goopy. It is very comfortable to apply during the day or at night. It goes on in a thin layer and adheres well to your lips. It does not just stay put and form an occlusive barrier, but a part of it descends into my lips and makes my lips moisturised & naturally plump. It helps deeply condition my lips, repairing flaky and dry skin. I had recently cut my lip, and this one helped to repair my lips overnight. I feel I do not need to reapply during the day, and it keeps my lips hydrated through the night as well. Love the tube packaging. A little goes a long way with this one, and it truly gives me baby lips. I want to repurchase this again.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Diisostearyl Malate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Castor Oil Isostearate, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Pentaerythrityl Tetraisostearate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Microcrystalline Wax, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Dehydroacetic Acid, Ceramide NP, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Water, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hyaluronic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter*\n\n**Rating: 4.5/5, WRP**\n\n***3.  Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula - with SPF 15 - Dark Chocolate & Mint ‚Çπ130***\n\nThis lip balm has the perfect shape for a lip balm in a stick & the texture is like that of a stick of butter. It does not have the typically waxy feeling. It is highly emollient and moisturising. SPF is an added benefit as lips also need sun protection to protect from ageing, especially if you are heading outside in the sun. Perfect for throwing in your purse. The smell and flavour are surprisingly nice. Ideal for all mint chocolate lovers out there. Even though it has some chemical filters, it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or aftertaste. I feel the need to reapply during the day, but it is an enjoyable feeling due to flavour and scent. Overall I quite enjoyed this lip balm. I will repurchase.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Dimethicone 1.5%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Oxybenzone 4.5%. Inactive ingredients: mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), microcrystalline wax (cera microcristallina ), copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, theobroma cacao (cocoa) seed butter, fragrance (parfum), tocopherol, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, isopropyl myristate, beta carotenex0003(CI 40800), zea mays (corn) oil, benzyl alcohol.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WRP**\n\n***4. The Body Shop Strawberry Lip Balm ‚Çπ250***\n\nThis used to be one of my favourite lip balms before I tried the ones above it. There is a theme here. This lip balm too adds emollience to your lips. The artificial strawberry flavour and the smell are intense and quite enjoyable in my 15-year-old brain. This lip balm has been intended for your partner to enjoy. I'm not too fond of the pot packaging, but there is enough product here to last you months. The flavours are interesting and mood uplifting. Overall it is a nice lip balm but I won't be repurchasing it because I can get something similar in a better packaging for 1/5th the price.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Ricinus Communis Seed Oil, Polyglyceryl-3 Beeswax, Lanolin, Parfum, Cera Alba, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Silica \\[NANO\\], Tocopheryl Acetate, Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Ammonium Glycyrrhizate, Aroma, Fragaria Vesca Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Benzyl Benzoate, BHT, CI 15850, CI 15850.*\n\n**Rating: 4/5, WNRP**\n\n***5. Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask - Choco Mint ‚Çπ1150***\n\nThis popular pick used to be my holy grail lip mask two years ago. This innovative product was one of the first of its descent and ahead of its time. Its thick and goopy texture catches eyeballs. This is my second tub of this product, and if you have tried one of these you know, this lasts a lifetime. Sadly, this queen has been dethroned by Bubi Bubi Lip Ampule. I do not find myself reaching for it anymore. My relationship with this product was like a young romance. I went in starry-eyed and fell fast for the bling, but now I find myself looking for more material suitors. The texture of this is very thick & goopy, but my issue with the product is that it never truly sinks in. It stays sticky, thick and wet on your lips and once you remove it (because it won't sink in), your lips won't feel much different than when you first put it on. The feeling on your lips is not particularly pleasant. This is why you cannot use it in the day. It is a good sleeping mask for the night if you put something underneath it as works well for locking in moisture. If you are curious to try this, I recommend getting a smaller sample size as that would last you 6 months and be more pocket friendly. The mint flavour quite nice and not overpowering. The tingle is not intense. I will not be repurchasing this.\n\n***Ingredients:*** *Diisostearyl Malate, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Phytosteryl/Isostearyl/Cetyl/Stearyl/Behenyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polybutene, Microcrystalline Wax/Cera Microcristallina/Cire Microcristalline, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Synthetic Wax, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Sucrose Tetrastearate Triacetate, Mica, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax/Candelilla Cera Hydrocarbons/Cire De Candelilla, Candelilla Wax Esters, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Butter, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (Ci 77891), Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax/Copernicia Cerifera Cera/Cire De Carnauba, Dehydroacetic Acid, Methicone, Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Blue 1 Lake (Ci 42090), Limonene, Yellow 10 Lake (Ci 47005), Water/Aqua/Eau, Polyhydroxystearic Acid, Linalool, Potassium Alginate, Glycerin, Propanediol, BHT, Alcohol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Lycium Chinense Fruit Extract, Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry) Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Angustifolium (Blueberry) Fruit Extract, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Sapindus Mukorossi Fruit Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract, Fragaria Chiloensis (Strawberry) Fruit Extract, Rubus Chamaemorus Seed Extract, Chenopodium Quinoa Seed Extract, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Sodium Hyaluronate, Beta-Glucan, Ethylhexylglycerin, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Disodium Edta, Ascorbyl Glucoside*\n\n***Rating: 3/5, WNRP***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***RiRe Bubble Bubble Mask: - Bubbling mask that does nothing.

I got it for Rs. 575/-.\n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Arginine, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Pentylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium hyaluronate Crosspolymer, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tripeptide-1, Hexapeptide-9, Hexapeptide-11, Copper Tripeptide-1\n\n**My Skin Type:** Combination skin with an oily T-zone\n\n**Usage:** Since Past 6 months\n\n**My Experience:** I absolutely enjoyed using this toner for the past few months. Here's why, this has a lightweight texture, thicker than water but thinner than a serum/gel, that gets absorbed on your skin easily. My skin never felt sticky or greasy on application. It used to get absorbed within a few minutes, even when I mistakenly applied it excessively. \n\nIt's a very hydrating. Due to seasonal change, my skin had become very dry. Whenever I applied this toner, I instantly felt a calming effect on my skin, and it helped lessening the dryness for a while. Obviously it ain't enough as you need a hydrating Moisturizer to go along with it. \n\nThis one has fragrance, but it wasn't too overpowering. If you're someone who can tolerate a little fragrance, you'll be okay. \n\nMy favourite part is how easy it's on your pocket. The price might appear a bit high, but the quantity makes up for the price. As listed above, I've been using the toner since last 6 months daily, still 30-40% is left. \n\n**WRP:** Maybe Yes. Why Maybe? Coz I'm a victim of FOMO who wants to keep on trying new skincare items. If I'm able to stick to one product, I can see SNP toner becoming a part of my regular routine.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:** A fantastic but underrated product.",

    "body": "So I've been testing this product over the past month, and since I haven't seen any other reviews of it I figured I would write one myself!\n\nI have combination skin with dry cheeks and an oily t-zone, and my skin is dehydrated from tret. I am very acne prone, and also very prone to PIH. I started using tret in november of last year, and had 5-6 weeks of purging consisting of cystic acne on both cheeks, which resulted in pretty bad PIH. My persistent acne has since cleared up, but I still get random spots that pop up here and there, and they usually end up in PIH regardless of whether or not I picked at it. For reference, here is my full routine:\n\nFANCL mild cleansing oil (PM)   \nCosrx low ph cleanser  \nEpiduo (AM)  \nCosrx bha liquid (PM)    \n.025% tretinoin (PM)  \nMissha FTE Intensive  \nMuji light toning water  \nNR white vita capsule essence    \nNR snail solution emulsion  \nCosrx honey sleeping pack  \n\nBoth the Missha FTE and the NR emulsion contain niacinamide, but they didn't make a significant difference in fading my PIH, which is why I decided to try out the capsule essence. For some reason, I can't find the product on the nature republic website right now, but when I last checked the site it states that the product contains 5% niacinamide! The product packaging also states 5%. The other products in the white vita line, if I remember correctly, contain 2%.  \n\n\n**Edited to add** Ingredients: Water, Niacinamide (5%), Methylpropanediol, Betaine, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dioscorea Japonica Root Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Pentylene Glycol, Piper Methysticum Leaf/Root/Stem Extract, Phellinus Linteus Extract, Articum Lappa Root Extract, Pancratium Maritimum Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Nymphaea Alba Flower Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Tranexamic Acid, Panthenol, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Gelatin, Carbomer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, Polyquaternium-51, Glycosyl Trehalose, Glycerin, Cellulose Gum, Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate, Raffinose, Biosaccharide Gum-1, Disodium EDTA, Lecithin, Butylene Glycol, Calcium Alginate, Agar, Gellan Gum, Propanediol, Acetic Acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Zinc PCA, Sodium Palmitoyl Proline, Inositol, Bisabolol, Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bioflavonoids, Ascorbic Acid, Tocopherol, Hesperidin, Fragrance, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate  \n\nThe essence is a clear, slightly runny gel. You can see tiny bead-like capsules in the bottle, but they aren't so noticeable when you pump out the product and apply it. It sinks in quickly and provides light hydration. There is a slight tackiness after it absorbs, but it goes away after I apply the rest of my routine. The essence does contain fragrance, but the scent is surprisingly very subtle and clean. I barely notice it, unlike with the other NR products I've used. Also the essence came in a set with mini versions of the white vita toner and emulsion (I don't think NR sells the essence by itself, although some other online sellers might). Unfortunately they both contain alcohol, which I am sensitive to, so I couldn't test those.\n\nSo, does the essence work? For me, yes! I've noticed that over the past few weeks, my PIH is fading much faster than usual. The stubborn marks all over my cheeks have become noticeably lighter. Now that the PIH is finally going away, I barely need to use concealer for them. I haven't introduced any other products over the past month, so for now I'm attributing the improvement to this essence. I'm hoping this improvement continues, and if it does, this essence might find a permanent spot in my routine.\n",

I have hooded lids (full Korean).\n\n**Fragrance is not a deal-breaker for me in wash-off products, although I am wearier of essential oils than I am of synthetic fragrance.

Pretty good at removing sunscreen and makeup if you take the time to massage it in. Felt like a godsend before being completely spoiled by AB first cleansers. That was when I thought a little bit of waterproof mascara being left over giving me slight raccoon eyes when I woke up in the morning was \"acceptable\" and \"as good as it's gonna get\".\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** No. Has gentle surfactants but **it also has TWELVE different essential oils.** One of which is endangered and need active conservation according to Wikipedia, which I personally don't feel comfortable using:\n\n>*Bulnesia sarmientoi* was listed as [endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) in the 2018 publication of the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List), due to the [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation) of [Gran Chaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Chaco#Conservation_issues) and a strong global demand for its wood, extracts, and [essential oils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil) since 2001.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulnesia_sarmientoi#cite_note-IUCN-1) IUCN estimates indicate that over three generations the global population will decline by around 50%.\n\nRequires much more massaging to remove waterproof makeup which may be harsh on sensitive skin and cause more redness.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy. Not too strong.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No, it's a 2-in-1. However, it does not always get rid of everything on the first try, so another cleanse may be necessary.\n\n**Repurchase?** No. It did not bother my sensitive skin too much, but I'm cutting out all essential oils from my skincare + not effective enough as a first cleanser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Naive Botanical Olive Cleansing Oil 230mL / 7.8 oz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ovky561y6251.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=fecf9195af66872bce90dabfe904de2a500678a5\n\nI found out about this [here, ranked #4](https://my-best.net/15468). I wanted something with the highest cleansing power that washed off cleanly & is affordable.\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $14 on eBay before pandemic started. A little less than $7 in Japan. Even at double the price for me in the US, I have had this since **July 2019** (June 2020 now) and I am only *halfway through* it because of how incredibly effective it is with small amounts. I would run out of other cleansing oils relatively fast because of how much it takes to remove all my layers of waterproof makeup. Am shocked tbh.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, ethylhexyl palmitate, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate, glyceryl tri (caprylic acid / capric acid), PEG-8 glyceryl isostearate, sorbeth tetraisostearate-30, olive leaf extract, olive fruit oil, squalane, BG Water, cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid bisethoxy diglycol, **perfume.**\n\n**Texture:** A cleansing oil of medium thickness, not overly greasy. Smooth, spreads very easily. Not super thin like something like Kose Softymo Speedy.\n\n**Efficacy:** Not drying at all on my very dry skin. SUPER effective at removing waterproof sunscreen and makeup. Takes absolutely NO TIME AT ALL, which is very different from other cleansing oils that required me to massage it in for a while. Color me beyond impressed. This is honestly the best first cleanser I've used so far. ZERO residue of any trace of makeup after removal.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes and no. It did not bother me personally but it does contain fragrance. I'm unsure if the current ingredient list is accurate as the Japanese ranking site states it contains essential oils but the list from Yesstyle does not.\n\n**Scent:** Citrusy, woodsy. Not so strong that it is super bothersome.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Absolutely. As soon as it becomes affordable again when the pandemic dies down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Kracie Moistage W Cold Cream 270g / 9.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcxvpzp1y6251.jpg?width=249&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0996cc355ecab1a721c0c6316ef76089e89c8b6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q416df74y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1fd8cd5a3d8cf58c3c0822eb9da142611c5826bc\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $16 on eBay. Currently about $19 on [Yesstyle](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kracie-moistage-w-cold-cream-270g/info.html/pid.1069419619). Very cost-effective bc of its huge size.\n\n**Ingredients:** Mineral oil, water, polysorbate 65, microcrystalline wax, glycerin, DPG, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone, stearoyl glutamate Na, stearic acid, polysorbate 80, beeswax, xanthan gum, olive oil, squalane, hydrogenated castor oil hydroxystearate, silk extract , Ethanol, hydrolyzed collagen, cetearyl alcohol, EDTA2Na, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben\\*\\*, perfume.\\*\\*\n\n**Texture:** A rich, thick white cream.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a huge NO from me, dawg. This is terrible. It barely removes anything waterproof and leaves a heavy residue. However, if you're the type of person who doesn't mind using a more stripping cleanser afterward to wash this off, or using a washcloth, I guess I can see it as being, um. Acceptable?\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** It is gentle but slightly fragranced. No reaction from my skin other than disgust at being left in a thick film after wash off.\n\n**Scent:** Very light floral.\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** YES.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Body Shop Camomile Sumptuous Cleansing Butter 76g / 2.7 Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znms9m83y6251.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45f6d28d2958c8133b26a2ab363b88bcf71d065e\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $13.65 on Amazon. Currently [$14.85 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F165210/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).\n\n**Ingredients:** Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Synthetic Wax, PEG-20 Glyceryl Triisostearate, Olea Europaea  (Olive) Fruit Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Caprylyl Glycol, Tocopherol, **Parfum, Aqua, Linalool, Limonene,** Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Citric Acid.\n\n**Texture:** A thick, opaque white balm, not overly greasy or waxy.\n\n**Efficacy:** This is a good first cleanser. Quite travel friendly but I have not traveled with it in weather that would melt it so I don't know if it would leak through. It removes everything quite well, no complaints here. It still is not as good as the Kracie botanical olive one, takes longer to break down sunscreen and makeup, and may leave behind a slight amount of waterproof mascara if you aren't thorough enough with massaging/letting it sit on the skin long enough to melt everything.\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Has not bothered mine, but fragrance is pretty strong. \n\n**Scent:** Strong floral. Although not strong enough to CHOKE on like some Korean products - those of intimate with Korean skincare - you know what I'm talking about. /sideyes my mom's side of the skincare in the bathroom\n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** No, I don't like the scent and the packaging. It's hard to close properly on first try. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# (Not A First Cleanser But) [Equate Eye Makeup Remover](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Beauty-Oil-Free-Eye-Makeup-Remover-5-5-oz/39139097) 5.5 oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfnqtmh5y6251.jpg?width=355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05638b521fa8a76a4fe2673625e2b750241a492f\n\n**Cost:** $4 \n\n**Ingredients:** Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Sodium Chloride, Dipropylene Glycol, Poloxamer 182, Allantion, Tetrasodium Edta, Benzalkonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus), Fruit Extract, Sodium Phosphate, Disodium Phosphate. \n\n**Texture:** You gotta shake it before use. Watery but has silicone slip and thickness. \n\n**Efficacy:** I've used this as a first cleanser with a cotton pad in a pinch on extra lazy nights. It pretty works well to remove things pretty well although it WILL leave a residue obviously that you have to wash off. Honestly can't really tell the difference between this and the Neutrogena one and it's cheaper so. I use it to remove eyelash glue and waterproof mascara that I put on them. \n\nIt doesn't magically whisk away a mess of water-resistant lash glue residue + waterproof mascara on top of THAT (i don't really think anything can) but it's adequate, cheap, fragrance-free, oil-free and prolongs the wear on my beloved Miche Bloomin falsies (Girly Flair is the most popular bc of Pony Makeup but that style is horrible for me - it's SUPER fragile and breaks so easily compared to the other styles) by 10x. \n\nI just pour some in my palm and poke the lashes in a little puddle of it for a bit till the mascara comes off and then remove the glue with my fingers afterward. I don't wash them off afterward and whatever residue it leaves behind does not interfere at all with the next coat of mascara I put on them lashes.\n\n(Gonna write a separate review, but FYI - I prefer [DUO quick drying lash glue](https://www.ulta.com/duo-quick-set-lash-adhesive-clear?productId=pimprod2003529) in the purple label more than the super famous Japanese [D-Up Eyelash Fix](https://www.amazon.co.jp/D-UP-%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97-4946324013622-D-U-P-%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC/dp/B0012VQTO2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=d-up&qid=1590969259&sr=8-5) that's touted as #1 globally. I find that it's SOOO much quicker drying than D-Up and makes the lashes stick BETTER, longer, and stands stronger to tears. Plus it's latex-free too, for sensitive eyes. And way cheaper! I regret getting extra back ups of the D-Up thinking it'll be the best thing ever. There are still some cons that D-Up has an upperhand on, but I'll talk about that in that review post.)\n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Repurchase?** Hell yeah. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini-Review on the **Garnier Skin Active Micellar Cleansing Water (Pink Cap):** This was just a sample so I ran out of it pretty fast but I remember being surprised that it actually was pretty effective at removing waterproof makeup. Scent-free, I quite liked it I think. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water, For Waterproof Makeup (Blue Cap), 13.5 Fl Oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4fb7kb6y6251.jpg?width=556&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b56036478b358bd5043af8f80652b63a71cb7f9f\n\n**Cost:** Got it for $6.59 on Amazon. \n\n**Ingredients:** AQUA/WATER, CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, HEXYLENE GLYCOL, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DECYL GLUCOSIDE, POLYAMINOPROPYL BIGUANIDE. F.I.L.# D178190/1 \n\n**Texture:** Watery, greasy. I hate this. I got it mainly to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and chest at the end of the day without taking a whole damn shower. Leave a very unpleasant, greasy residue that I cannot stand on my skin. No. \n\n**Efficacy:** I only tried removing my makeup with this several times and it was okay I think. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** Definitely. \n\n**Repurchase?** No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Bioderma Sensibio H2O 500 ml / 16.7 fl oz\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q1ucyc8y6251.jpg?width=443&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ffe3ed17780adf84d930a94d27ae29416decdc52\n\n**Cost:** $15 on Amazon.com\n\n**Ingredients:** Water (aqua), Peg-6 Caprylic/capric Glycerides, Cucumis Sativus (cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mannitol, Xylitol, Rhamnose, Fructooligosaccharides, Propylene Glycol, Disodium Edta, Cetrimonium Bromide. \n\n**Texture:** Watery, very light! Refreshing. Doesn't leave a greasy gross residue like above. I still splash water on top of the skin before toweling off and I still can feel a slight film. Ideally, I would like to wash it all off bc Lab Muffin says it's still not the best to leave surfactants on the skin, but most nights I can't be bothered and it shouldn't be *that* bad if people in places with harsh water just leave it on the skin, right? \n\nI guess a way to deal with that would be to wipe away using a toner/water/spray with a cotton pad or something but idk, that's more unnecessary garbage I feel. And more rubbing sensitive skin. \n\n**Efficacy:** This is fairly new. Got it for the same reason as the Garnier blue cap. It removes my waterproof sunscreen from my neck just fine with a baby wipe or cotton pad. But for everyday, I much prefer a cleansing oil to reduce the amount of tugging and rubbing on my skin as well as disposable wipes or pads. I tried it for removing waterproof mascara from my falsies like the Equate one, but it was okay, similar, but not as good and not as \"conditioning\" on my falsies to keep them soft. \n\n**Sensitive Skin Friendly:** Yes.\n\n**Scent:** None. \n\n**Did it sting my eyes?** No.\n\n**Double Cleansing Necessary?** For me, yes. \n\n**Repurchase?** Yes! \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext on my Wish List!!:\n\n\\- Muji Sensitive Cleansing Oil 400 ml\n\n\\- Muji Mild Cleansing Oil 400 ml \n\n\\- Muji Mild Milky Cleansing 200 ml \n\n\\- More cleansing gels (first cleansers NOT second cleansers) (I've tried Kikumasamune one before and I really liked that one for heavy, non-waterproof makeup days! Also Innisfree Jeju Bija cleansing gel - but this dried my skin out a bit when used as a LONE first cleanser but for some odd reason was fine when followed up with an actual second cleanser! So strange. That was years ago tho. Much earlier than Kiku.)\n\n\\- DHC Deep Cleansing Oil\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope that helps! \n\n(Ugh I have so many review posts and other posts I wanna write and I can't get them off my mind but I gotta wait for the big sunscreen & ceramide/pseudo-ceramide/urea creams review posts bc I'm so damn extra and gotta wait til I can take more Before & After photos months apart and compare winter vs summer performances. /eyeroll \n\nBUT I WANNA TALK ABOUT MORE SKINCARE RIGHT NOOOWWW SDKFJSD32kfd#@! But don't want to make claims or claim favs without *absolute* thorough testing either.. Sigh, the struggle!!!)",

I've tried mint and peach and prefer the mint. Great lip product and I've used a lot. Some favorites being the Laneige Lip sleeping mask, Bite Agave Nectar Lip mask, Dr. Dan's Cortibalm, and C.O. Bigelow My Favorite Night Balm. This is one of the more affordable options out of the ones listed and it's amazing! Very very hydrating as someone who suffers with severely dry lips. It makes my lips feel like butter. Has some great ingredients like ceramides, green tea, panthenol. Very mild fragrances just enough to notice when applying but almost like it's unscented after it's on your lips for a few minutes. I'd say it's a medium consistency not too thick and not too thin just enough of a barrier. Really recommend if you've had trouble finding a great affordable everyday lip product.

    "body": "So there are roughly 12748 reviews of the Dear by Enprani Moistfull Booskin toner. Apparently it's actual magic, according to said reviews. However! There really don't seem to be any reviews of the **Softfull** Booskin toner. Like really zero. I looked. A lot. To my knowledge it isn't discontinued or anything (it's still available for purchase on several websites), so I was surprised that there was just so much...*nothing*. \n\nAnyways, I'm going to leave a review here in hopes that it will help someone else down the road. \n\nFor reference, my skin is combo/oily, dehydrated and clog prone because I have giant pores. My skin is not a fan of denatured alcohol or silicones, but otherwise I'm not sensitive to much. Fragrance is okay with me, too.\n\n**What it Does:** According to the product descriptions, the Softfull Booskin is meant to \"control unnecessary and excessive sebum and prevent shine to boost clear and clean skin. Optimizes condition of oily skin after cleansing to [enhance] the effect of the next stage of care. Creates moisturized skin inside and smooth and matte skin outside.\" Oh, and my favorite part: \"Creates cotton veil for soft and gentle skin texture like downy hair and fills moisture evenly with tightening effect.\" \n\nOh man, skin that feels like downy hair? Sign me up! #goals\n\nWhat I've gathered is that, like the Moistfull Booskin, it's meant to be a hydrating/prepping toner for oily skin. That's how I've been using it, at least.\n\n\n**CosDNA Analysis:** \n\nUnfortunately, this one isn't on CosDNA. Only the Moistfull Booskin shows up. ;-; I've tried finding it on the Enprani website, buuuut since my Korean isn't the greatest (re: um mostly nonexistent), it didn't exactly go well. If anyone out there knows/has access to the exact ingredient list, I would *looove* to see it! I don't have the box, because this was purchased used from r/asianbeautyexchange. I know, I know. Sorry guys. \n\nI don't want to assume it's similar to the Moistfull Booskin because I genuinely have no idea. I will say that all of the product information I *was* able to find say that Rose of Jericho extract, witch hazel and cotton seed are a few of the star ingredients.\n\n**EXCITING UPDATE:** The absolutely lovely u/ganbattelilone was kind enough to post an ingredient list for me AND add it to CosDNA! Here you go, dears:\n\nWater, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Glycerin, Disodium EDTA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (licorice), Phenyl Methicone, **Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract**(this is Rose of Jericho), Propylene Glycol, **Witch Hazel Extract**, **Cotton Extract**, **Artichoke Leaf Extract**(improves elasticity), **Spiraea Ulmaria Extract**(this is meadowsweet- anti-irritant), PPG-16-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Triethylhexanoin, Fragrance.\n\nThe only potential trigger is the ever-present butylene glycol. \n\n*The following geek out is totally optional. Just skip down to the next part if you don't care about me nerding out over ingredients. I won't be offended, promise.* \n\nRose of Jericho is sweet, you guys. It's called the \"resurrection rose\" because it survives crazy desert climates by curling up into a dead-looking root ball. Once it detects moisture though, BAM! It opens up and comes alive [like this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41z0ifszDnL.jpg). Cool, right?! Apparently trehalose (a sugar) is responsible for this. In the plant, it regulates metabolic function to conserve energy; on skin, though, it binds moisture and gives a similar \"revival\" effect. \n\nIts dynamic nature is what (allegedly/anecdotally) makes it such a great skincare ingredient. Supposedly the extract contains some of the same enzymes that allow the plant to respond to its environment, which translates to skincare that's better suited to your specific skin/moisture levels. I couldn't find any scientific research on topical usage, so I don't know how true that is in general. I only know that biologically that makes sense to me and my own experience seems to support that reasonably well. So take it with a grain of salt.\n\n(Ôæâ^ „ÉÆ^ )Ôæâ‚úß:„ÉªÔæü‚úß *OKAY GUYS /NERD RANT BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED REVIEW:*\n\n**My Experience:** \n\nI've been using this for ~3ish weeks for my morning and evening routine, as well as whenever I sheet mask.The first few days I used it, I did a split-face test to see 1. if it would cause a weird reaction, and 2. to see if it actually made a difference for the rest of my routine. \n\nOh boy. It made a huge difference. I was genuinely shocked by just how immediate and pronounced the difference was. I felt like my face was lopsided because the Booskin side was so soft and bouncy and the other side just wasn't.  \n\nThe bottle is huge, and I don't usually need much.The toner itself is very liquidy; it's really only slightly more viscous than water. The bottle has one of those tops that aftershave or hot sauce have where you need to tilt and shake it to get a couple of good splashes out. I like that, though, because it keeps me from accidentally spilling it everywhere. I use two splashes into my clean hands, pat them together and then pat the toner gently all over my face with my palms until it's fully absorbed. It absorbs quickly and my skin immediately feels softer and more hydrated. I don't have a cool digital skin analyzer (YET) but I *know* there's a difference in moisture levels. \n\n**There is definitely a scent.** And it lingers. Personally, I really love this part, but I know a lot of ABers are not in the Fragrance Fanclub. The scent is not overpowering at all, though. It's soft, feminine, a little powdery, a little floral, and a little bit of something else I can't quite place. Honestly, it just smells nostalgic to me, but not in a \"my-grandma's-Avon-perfume-from-1979\" way. Honestly, I'm happy it hangs around.\n\nIt makes every other product in my routine absorb quicker, and I feel like it helps the other products do their job better too, including my sheet mask essence. I guess that's the \"optimizing skin and enhancing care\" part! As for the controlling excess sebum aspect, I have been waking up with consistently less oily skin than I had been prior to adding this product to my daily routine.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** \n\nI love this toner. I was never really into toners of any kind prior to this. I was of the opinion that they were mostly just a waste of time and money. I'll definitely be repurchasing this one, though. It does exactly what it's advertised to do, and it does it *very* well. I'm super happy with how well this impulse buy worked out.\n\n(Ôæâ ^ „ÉÆ ^ )Ôæâ‚úß:„ÉªÔæü‚úß  **4/5** Would definitely repurchase!   ",

    "body": "**Skin Type:** 30\\-year old male with dehydrated, sensitive, acne/closed\\-comedone prone skin. I live on the coast in the Pacific Northwest so climate is relatively humid year round.\n\n**Reason for trying:** I decided to try out the Multivitamin Booster \\(MVB\\) because I'm going travelling for a month and want to take a minimalist routine with me. I have been using The Ordinary's \\(TO\\)  Hyaluronic Acid \\(HA\\), and Niacinimide \\+ Zinc serums for the past year and have been pleased with the results. However, taking two products in glass bottles backpacking seems a bit much, and the MVB has both Niacinimide and HA in it. I'm also looking for replacements because of Deciem's recent/ongoing antics, and Neutrogena is readily available in Canada \\(no waiting for stock and shipments\\). I wanted to test MVB out before committing to it wholeheartedly for a month of backpacking.\n\n**Product Presentation:** I was a bit skeptical of the MVB because it seems a bit gimmicky with its presentation. You can really see \"the science\" since there are balls of something suspended in the serum \\- I think they are made of *Mica*,\\* Titanium Dioxide, and Tocopheryl Acetate \\(Vitamin E\\). Neutrogena claims they are Vitamin E, but when they pump out they kind of dissolve and are a bit sparkly. The 30mL comes in the Hyrdo Boost themed packaging \\- a blue plastic pump bottle \\- with what I believe is an air\\-less pump, but don't quote me on this.\n\n[Bottle I'll be taking on my travels.](https://imgur.com/a/lPAFMrI)\n\n**Initial Thoughts:** Roughly 3\\-ish pumps works well over my face and neck \\(I'm a guy so I probably have more surface area to cover than most reading this\\). It comes out as a clear\\-ish gel \\- not as thick as Neutrogena's Water Gel moisturizers and not as runny as TO's HA serum \\- it feels light weight while it spreads very well over my face and neck. I feel like I finally understand the argument of TO not being \"cosmetically elegant\" from switching over to this serum directly from TO; other products apply really easily/smoothly over top of MVB, and it doesn't dry down quite as fast as TO's so I'm not rushing to layer and lock in hydration. I often felt my skin didn't feel that much more hydrated using TO's Hyaluronic Acid, but with MVB it does. I do not notice the sparkly\\-ness of the *Titanium Dioxide* or Mica balls after it has been applied, though I don't think I'd really care if I did.\n\n[One pump of dispensed product.](https://imgur.com/a/AZzb80P)\n\nMy only major ongoing criticism of MVB is that it's fragranced. I have pretty intolerant and sensitive skin, so I try to avoid fragrances as much as possible. This is the only product in my current routine with fragrance in it. Though I don't like the scent and wish it didn't have any, it's fairly subtle and goes away as soon as I apply moisturizer.\n\n**Ongoing Use:** I have been using this for 2\\-weeks twice a day, perhaps not the longest period of time to be reviewing, but enough time to know if my skin would negatively react to a product. I have noticed a slight reduction in redness and irritation from shaving on my skin, resulting in what seems like a more even skin tone. Most noticeably is my skin feels a lot more hydrated and smooth than with TO's comparable two serums used together. I personally have not noticed any negative reaction such as increased redness, CCs, acne, dermatitis etc.\n\n**Key Ingredients:** Niacinimide \\(Vitamin B3\\), Chondrus Crispus Powder & Extract \\(Red Seaweed\\), Panthenol \\(Vitamin B5\\), Sodium Hyaluronate \\(Hyaluronic Acid\\), Tocopheryl Acetate \\(Vitamin E\\), Arginine \\(Amino Acid\\), Serine \\(Amino Acid\\), Alanine \\(Amino Acid\\), and Threonine \\(Amino Acid\\).\n\n**Full Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, PEG\\-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Chondrus Crispus Powder, 1,2\\-Hexanediol, Acrylates/C10\\-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Panthenol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Agar, Gellan Gum, Fragrance, Disodium EDTA, Tocopheryl Acetate, Algin, Sucrose, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Arginine, PCA, Serine, Alanine, Citric Acid, Threonine, Mourera Fluviatilis Extract, Titanium Dioxide, Mica.\n\n[CosDNA Overview](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ad91330488.html)\n\n[Beautypedia Overview](https://www.beautypedia.com/skin-care-reviews/by-brand/neutrogena/_/hydro-boost-multivitamin-booster)\n\n**Summary:** I would recommend trying this product if you're looking to try a more multipurpose serum that's easy to find and relatively affordable. It has done a great job with helping my skin feel/stay hydrated, and also reducing redness on areas of my face. I have a feeling it might be a mainstay of mine, if not for the convenience of having a multipurpose serum for travelling. The price point in Canada varies \\- I think it's regularly priced around $25 \\- but I find Neutrogena is always on\\-sale somewhere, and you can get it for $15\\-$18 when it's reduced.\n\nI hope this helps anyone who has seen this in their drugstores and wants to give it a go. Like anything on this subreddit, YMMV!\n\n**TL/DR:** A rather gimmicky looking, yet pleasantly surprising drugstore serum that does a great job at hydrating my skin, reducing redness resulting in a more even looking skin tone. Goes on smoothly, and other products layer very well on top. Fragrance is my major negative comment on it after 2\\-weeks of use, though the fragrance hasn't caused me irritation. YMMV :\\)",

The texture is fantastic. The fragrance isn't off-putting either. A very good moisturizer but the only con is, it doesn't nourish my skin just hydrates if ykwim? It gets absorbed fast and my skin feels dry after it does. I think I would prefer this for intense summer like June? But yes I do use this when I have to write after moisturizing so that the pen doesn't slip and this is nice if I want hydration but isn't good for intense moisturization. Overall I love it but the moisturization is meh but the hydration is üòçüòç.  Would I repurchase it? Absolutely. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Product name*: **Dove Cooling Gel Cr√®me (Cream)** \n\n*Price :* Starts from around Rs 180(?), usually on sale easily available in nykaa, pharmacies and normal departmental stores. \n\n*Ingredient List:* Water, Glycerin, Dimethicone O, Isopropyl Palmitate, Petrolatum, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Carbomer, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10 30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide , Benzophenone-4 Disodium EDTA Menthol, FragranceCitral, Citronellol, Geraniol, Hexyl Cinnamal, Hydroxycitronellal, Limonene, Linalool, Ci 42090\n\n*Experience and opinion: Okay I will come out and say it, this is a little better than the ponds one just for body moisturizer, well ofc it's made for moisturization but ykwim? In my condition, this works well. Does exactly what it claims, cools. Feels nice on the skin, good fragrance, great texture, and good hydration. I won't say intense moisturization but it's great IMO and doesn't make me sweat so IDK what's better hehe. It is really good if you want a nice summer moisturizer that makes your skin soft and doesn't feel chip chip and hydrates.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Comparison***: both of them are really good moisturizers and have their plus points but I like the dove one more for body moisturization. The ponds one isn't as long-lasting as the dove either. Overall verdict, the dove is better than ponds for moisturization, maybe because it is a cream, not a gel but if you have a condition like me you will prefer this more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay I know this can be an unnecessary post but I wanted to really post this comparison IDK why and yeah here it is, please be nice omg and don't call me out and say IDK anything coz I'm actually anxious about that happening haha xD okay lol, enough Rona. \n\nHope this helps anyone who had this doubt \n\nlove you<3",

    "body": "Hair Type: Thin, 2B/C Curl Patterns, Oily scalp, prone to hairfall\n\nSome hair background:\nSo I switched to using silicone and sulphate free haircare on a whim back in 2017. To my surprise, this changed my previously mostly straight hair to pretty curly. I learnt about CGM afterwards but since that seemed like a lot of effort, I just stuck to using CG friendly products and was happy with what my hair looked like. Cut to 3 months ago, when I moved to a new place with a really humid climate and my hair fall became like 10 fold. I tried going back to products that had worked for me in the past but nothing helped. Eventually, I thought, that the increased frizziness caused by humidity was the cause of the hair fall and since no product seemed to make my hair soft and silky like before, I decided to go back to silicones. A combination that helped my hair fall to some extent was Bblunt Intense Moisture Shampoo (the blue one) and Loreal Professional Serie Quinoa Protein Hair Mask (used this as conditioner after every wash). But this combination also did make my hair straighter than it had been in recent years. Decided to give the BBlunt Curly Hair range a try (the pink color one). This range does contain Silicones, so it is not strictly CG friendly but it has worked for me. I do not use any leave-in products to style my hair, but I don't mind some frizz. The curls I get from just these 3 products are pretty impressive, as good as any other CG friendly shampoo/conditioners I have used in the past. And my hair fall though still not as less as it was 6 months ago, is definitely better. Details below.\n\n1) Bblunt Curly Hair Prepoo (Pink and white tub packaging)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Aloe Vera Extract, Cocos (Coconut)Water, Aayla mido propyltrimonium Chloride/Acrylamide Copolymer, Citric Acid, PEG-90M, Parfum (Perfume)\n\nThoughts: Definitely my favourite of the 3. I have been looking for a  pre-shampoo product to add to my routine. Oiling and Aloeing have not worked for me. I have previously used some hair masks that said they can be used before shower but they were thick and creamy and impossible to spread properly on semi-wet or dry hair. THIS product is everything I wanted. It is a gel-like consistency, spreads super easily. I usually brush out my hair before showering and this is when I lose the most hair. Since this product claims at helping in detangling I decided to use this before I brush my hair and the hair I lost was significantly less! During and post-shower, my hair maintains great slip!  This has the potential to be HG for me. It has a pleasant coconutty smell, but the fragrances in these products do not last too long, which is nice (The loreal mask makes my hair smell like a salon even 2 days later).\n\nRepurchase Status: WRP Definitely!\n\n2) Bblunt Curly Hair Shampoo (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua (Water), Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Cocamidopropyl Retain, Decyl Glucoside, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Glycol Distearate, Glycerin, Acrylates Copolymer, Cocamide MEA, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dipropylene Glycol, PEG-150 Distearate, Polysilicone-29, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-7, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Menthol, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Panthenol, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cocoyl Sarcosine,TriticumVulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate-20, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polysorbate-80, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Parfum (Perfume).\n\nThoughts: It is a shampoo that does its job. It cleans my oily scalp well without stripping it too much. It does not lather and spread as well as the blue BBlunt shampoo but that is to be expected as this one does not have SLS. One thing I have to mention is that near my roots this is the only product from the 3 that I used, and I noticed that the hair in that area did have some curls (usually hair close to my roots does not curl up), so this shampoo is definitely doing something right. Smells pretty fresh (like a cactus? or something softer than that lol) cant describe it. But again the smell does not linger post-shower.\n\nRepurchase Status: Maybe (I have a bunch of other shampoos lying around that I have to finish up first post-monsoon. If using any of those increases my hair fall again, will return to this)\n\n3) Bblunt Curly Hair Conditioner (Pink Tube)\n\nIngredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Behentrimonium, Methosulfate, Isopropyl Myristate, Dimethicone, Almond Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Silicone Quaternium, Polyquaternium-7, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Acetamide MEA, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Sorbitol, Sodium Cocoyl Collagen Amino Acid, Cococoyl Satosire, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Acid, Triticum Vulgare (Wheat) Germ Oil, Linolenic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Polysorbate 80, Polysorbate-20, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Glycosaminoglycans, Panthenol, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Magnesium Nitrate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, MAgnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Trideceth-12, Laureth-23, Laureth-4, Polyglyceryl-3 Caprate, Dipropylene Glycol, Perfume\n\nThoughts: When I first used it I felt like it was super light and would not do much conditioning, but to my surprise when I rinsed it out, my hair had great slip, and detangled very easily. Some of that I will say must be because of the prepoo, but this conditioner also must be contributing. I guess since I was using the super thick loreal mask as conditioner previously, that's why this conditioner feels very light to me, but if it's doing its job, then it's ok of course. This smells like something sweet... white chocolate or marzipan. Overall I like it, and in combination with the prepoo, my hair is a lot softer than the loreal mask. \n\nRepurchase Status: Probably (again have a bunch of conditioners, i wish to use up first)\n\nI am a bit confused that even with silicones, how do these products work so well in giving me curls. Maybe I just don't know enough about how silicones work. But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down, I can use my Fix My Curls Cleansing Shampoo once in a while, I guess.",

But if with continued use I feel like silicone buildup is weighing my hair down\n\nThat's because silicones are not the devil that cg hair community paints them out to be... Silicones are nothing but emollients just like natural oils that cg community likes to sing praises about... Except silicones are better than natural oils at their job of calming down the frizz and are lighter. And about weighing down, would your hair feel weighed down if you continuously apply oil without washing it off? Yes, yes you will. And what are oils again? Emollients same as a silicones. You see the similarity and the comparison. It took me a while to get out of the influencer-fed info that SILICONES WILL ABSOLUTELY DESTROY CURLY HAIR... Because I use sulphate free shampoo (wow shampoo at that) and silicone conditioner and feel no difference.\n\nSome people cannot tolerate silicones because that's how their *individual* hair is... Just like some people can't tolerate hyaluronic acid or a niacinamide serum. But this fear of silicones and this blanket statement that silicones are bad for curly hair comes from lack of education and knowledge about them. And if you have any doubt, feel free to ask.",

Gillette pounced on the market opportunity... slowly.  They spent several years (and millions of dollars) in testing, focus groups, and market analysis, culminating in the 1993 release of the Cool Wave (a \"foresty chypre\") and Wild Rain (a dewy, herbal, aquatic foug√®re).  Both scents had full product lines including splashes, balms, shave gels, deodorants, etc.\n\nGillette had struck metaphorical gold with their new lines, finding wild success in both the American and European markets.  Unfortunately, only one of the scents struck literal gold: Wild Rain's perfume formula ended up being prohibitively expensive for Gillette's target price point and they lost a lot of money on it, eventually resulting in its complete discontinuation.  (Fortunately, it can still be enjoyed today, lovingly preserved in B&M's Reserve Waves line.)  Cool Wave has survived to present day in Aftershave Splash, Aftershave Gel, and Deodorant formats.  This review will focus on the Aftershave Splash.\n\n#SpongeScore Assessment\n\n##Soothing Properties: 0/3\n\nDespite the suggestive name, Cool Wave has no menthol and does nothing to sooth or cool my face.  In fact, some of my all-time [most painful aftershave experiences](https://i.imgur.com/tvbj4Ji.gif) have been with Cool Wave.  Zero points.\n\n##Post-Application Face Feel: 1/3\n\nMuch like [Clubman,](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ewy671/classic_aftershave_review_clubman/) Cool Wave has absolutely nothing in it to hydrate, moisturize, or smooth one's skin.  Nothing.  Not even trace amounts of humectants.  Unsurprisingly, my face does feel bare and clean after application, but this product is not doing your skin any favors.\n\n##Fragrance (Heavily Scented): 2/3\n\nCool Wave is a woody chypre: citrus up top, labdanum and oakmoss below, and various woods for embellishment.  The odd thing about this fragrance, though, is the inclusion of a massive dose of dihydromyrcenol: a fresh, citrusy (lime/bergamot), vaguely floral (lavender), vaguely metallic chemical that's extremely resilient and long-lasting and thus frequently used in both personal and household cleaning products.  You might recognize it from fragrances like Drakkar Noir, Green Irish Tweed, Cool Water, Aspen, Bowling Greene, and a large percentage of \"metallic\" or \"aquatic\" perfumes on the market.  It gives Cool Wave a unique super-clean / super-90s character that few other aftershaves possess.\n\n**How You Will Smell** \n\nCool Wave opens with a refreshing synthetic blast of metallic citrus supported by a hefty dose of dihydromyrcenol.  It's fresh fresh fresh and smells like you just traveled back to 1995 and shaved your face.  There's an aquatic accord of some sort that just barely hides below the citrus, giving it a bit of a blue tint like Invictus or Cool Water.  The citrus aspects last maybe 5-10 minutes and the aquatic / metallic character lasts quite a while longer than that.  If hit by a bit of moisture as the day progresses, the dihydromyrcenol will occasionally re-assert itself with another unexpected burst of freshness.\n\nAs Cool Wave dries down it begins to reveal its woody chypre side, with a heart of subtle patchouli and tobacco resting on top of a big smooth base of oakmoss, leather, pine, and musk.  There's no amber or vanilla in here to sweeten it up and it's a pretty grown-up scent.\n\nProjection and longevity are both strong for an aftershave.  It clearly projects within arm's length for several hours and sometimes you can still catch whiffs of it in passing 6-8 hours after application.  The skin scent might even last until bedtime.\n\n**What You Will Smell** \n\nAnosmia sets in quickly with this aftershave and I'm more or less blind to it in less than an hour, picking up only slight hints of it throughout the day.  With close proximity to the nose, the fresh top notes are a little more dominant, and by the time the fragrance would dry down to its warm, masculine base I can barely smell it any more.  It smells good, but it doesn't last long.\n\n**Fragrance Pairings / Can It Stand On Its Own?** \n\nThis one is tricky.\n\nConsidering that the original impetus behind Cool Wave was \"Gillette noticed that American men weren't buying as much perfume as Gillette wanted them to,\" it should be no surprised that YES Cool Wave Can Stand On Its Own as a cologne... if that's how you use it.  It has the strength, the staying power, and the complexity it needs to act as your '90s fragrance of the day.  You'll be walking around in a pleasant little bubble of Cool Wave all day long.\n\nProblem is, you won't notice it if you put it on your face and go blind to it in an hour.  You'll be left going \"I feel like I should put some cologne on\" when really no, no you shouldn't because you're already wearing some.  There's no need to pair it with something else.  Frankly, I would recommend against it because you'll leave a wake of nuclear sillage behind you.\n\n#Summary and Verdict\n\n**Cool Wave earns a SpongeScore of 3/10: [yet](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/dzj7e1/classic_aftershave_review_aqua_velva_musk/) [another](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/epzfyb/classic_aftershave_review_brut/) [aftershave](https://old.reddit.com/r/Wetshaving/comments/ewy671/classic_aftershave_review_clubman/) best used as a cologne instead of a post-shave product.**\n\nNow, I'd like to point out that Gillette also offers a [Sensitive Skin Aftershave Gel](https://gillette.com/sensitive-skin-aftershave-gel) made with the same fragrance formula.  Without getting into too much detail: it still hurts after a *really* rough shave, but it does a good job cooling and soothing after a mediocre to good shave; it leaves skin feeling fantastically *smooth* and clean (no greasy residue!); the fragrance is lighter and the gel base buries the base notes a bit, leaving it brighter, shorter-lived, and easier to layer with other '80s/'90s proto-aquatic fragrances.  Depending on the day and my mood, it easily scores a 7/10 or 8/10 and is the far better of the two options if you're looking for a good aftershave instead of a mislabeled cologne.",

    "body": "I wanted to share my thoughts after buying and testing two bottles of the Global Beauty Care Shimmering Body Oil, one with Pineapple & Glycolic Acid and one with Coconut & Polyglutamic Acid. \n\nObservations:\n* They come with a safety seal, but one of the bottles had a punctured seal. This is just my reminder to check the seal before you leave the store. \n* The first two ingredients are glycerin and water (pic 4). There is very little oil in these, if any (the coconut one has a small amount of coconut oil). PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil is polyethylene glycol derived from castor oil and often used in cosmetic products as an emulsifier and emollient. This feels more like a gel on the skin, and left my arms stick rather than oily. \n* There's no visual difference in color between the two bottles' shimmer when you apply it to the skin. I wouldn't consider this a shimmer either, more like visible glitter pieces (pics 2 and 3). \n* Both products smelled nice, but the fragrance did not last very long. \n* After applying to my skin and massaging it on, my hand had more glitter on it than where I applied it. \n* I did not use these long enough to observe any benefits from the actives listed on the front, but based on ingredient order it is likely that there's not enough of any of them to be effective, and in my own opinion I wouldn't seek these out for the acids and retinol. If I'm going in the sun to show off the shimmer, I don't want potentially photosensitizing ingredients in the shimmer product. Sunscreen is a must with these types of actives. \n\nBuy it if:\n* You're a fan of glitter gels a la 1990s\n* You don't mind sticky texture\n* You're OK with glitter getting everywhere\n\nSkip it if:\n* You want subtle sheen or body oil\n* You want the benefits of the active ingredients\n* You have texture sensitivities\n\nAlternatives\n* Mix a hefty squeeze from a liquid highlighter (like the LA Colors one from this week's Anti Haul post) or bronzer (like the bpure bronzer drops) with a dollop of body oil (like the Personal Care vitamin E or coconut oils) and apply\n* Generously apply a highlighter stick to the area (like the bpure highlighter sticks) and then massage it into the skin with an oil like the ones mentioned above\n\nVerdict:\nThese aren't for me, but I can see the appeal of them. So I'll be giving one away to a friend who can use it, and tossing the one that came opened. ",

    "body": "[Product Picture üñº https://imgur.com/a/CTKGFVJ] \n\nF/26\nClimate - North India. Hot in summers, goes low to about 10¬∞c in winters. But I mostly stay indoors in AC environment so moot point. \n\nCurrent Skin Type - Combination, Acneic. Sensitive to some natural & specific ingredients, resilient to most actives.\n\nPrice : ‚Çπ350 for 50ml ; but you can always find it on discount. \n\nIngredients List :- Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Propanol-2, Salicylic Acid, Triethanolamine, Capryloyl Glycine, Allantoin, Panthenol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Sodium Ascorbate, Tocopherol and Retinol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Disodium EDTA, Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca Alternifolia) Leaf Oil.\n\nIt's got 1.5%Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient afaik. \n\nHas hydrating & soothing ingredients like aloe juice, panthenol & allantoin, tocopherol (Vit E) as antioxidant & emollient, hydrogenated castor oil which makes mists moisturizing. Sodium ascorbate helps in brightening skin & Retinol the superstar which exfoliates, smoothens skin & also helps treat acne. TTO - which is a potent anti acne spot treatment on its own as its anti microbial & anti bacterial. Together all these ingredients make for a wonderful cocktail for skin. \n\nIt's marketed for the body but I used it on my face as the percentage is not high. \n\nViscosity - Thin watery with slight oil slick feeling. Biphased micellar water type texture. \n\nLet me preface this by saying I used Salyzap Spray everyday twice a day for 1.5 years, sometimes I even used it thrice a day in case of painful pimples ; & my facial skin type used to be OILY all over. The product feels just as non oily as it did a year ago, no dryness or extra oiliness. So I'd say it's a product that suits all skin types. \n\nThe spray from the nozzle isn't fine, but it's not a harsh squirt either. It sprays in the diameter of a 10g silver coin,not wider than that. If I spray it very close to skin I can reduce the spray size to area of about 1 finger tip unit. \n\nI love this product. *Holy Grail. WRP* . Its so cheap & works so well & a lot easier to incorporate into my routine compared to spot treatment gels or clay masks. \n\nI use about 4 to 5 sprays for my whole face. \n\nThe Salyzap Spray reduces the size of whitehead to half in 1 use, pustules in 2 uses, & they'll be gone in 3 uses. \n\nWith regular usage my blackheads disappeared & they don't occur anymore. \n\nIt doesn't work on papules but it does work on cystic acne to some extent. After regular usage they flatten out on their own. They don't erupt & come to a head so I'm saved the trouble of dealing with PIH as aftermath. \n\nI believe the retinol helps in evening out skin texture &and the sodium ascorbate (a mineral salt of vitamin C) helps in lightening the acne marks. My pimples don't scar or leave less severe dark marks behind compared to other acne treatment products I have used. \nIt also helps in reducing pimple size so there's smaller area to deal with later. I think it's because of the retinol. \n\nBefore using Salyzap spray I used to use Tea tree oil from The Body Shop combined with a salicylic acid spot treatment gel & another anti acne gel moisturizer from Tvakh to keep my pimples at bay. Now as I use this I've cut down acne management into just 1 step. So convenient üòç \n\nI love this. If you aren't sensitive to tea tree oil then buy it eyes closed. It works great & is so inexpensive & great value for money at ‚Çπ350 for 50ml. \n\nI'd go as far as saying its better than PC BHA. I have the PC BHA & it's very gentle & works quite slow compared to this. Salyzap is like a SOS, where as PC is more like daily mild treatment, despite the fact it has 2% SA.\n\nIf you're looking for a leave on BHA exfoliant or spot treatment I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SALYZAP SPRAY.",

It's been [hypothesized that glutathione protects against oxidized vit c radicals](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-7424-3_11), which I found quite interesting, so I gave the serum a shot. \n\nI tested it with my pH strips and it has a pH of around 3.\n\nAlso interesting is that I didn't get a flush from the LAA/niacinamide combo. Previously I had used Purito's c serum and that caused Kim Kardashian vampire facial level of flushing. When I started using the serum, there was a very strong prickling sensation, but no redness or itching. I persevered and it went away by the 4th day, although I find that if my face is damp upon application, I'll still get some prickling/ tingling.

(?)\n\nLastly, glutathione itself/alone has been shown to have some anti-aging activity IN ADDITION to its known brightening/whitening qualities. It's supposed to be an extremely potent antioxidant (I supplement with it daily.) I've actually been looking for skincare products with glutathione in them but haven't found much other than a ridiculously expensive serum from Perricone and a couple things from Skin Actives, hence my interest in this product.",

They have spread from there to the sides of my face and chin, and since then have randomly disappeared from my forehead but have remained everywhere else. I have tried switching my shampoo, laundry detergent, toothpaste, and using a clean towel over my pillow every night. I have changed my entire routine slowly and completely multiple times. I have not found a permanent routine yet because I keep thinking it's a product causing the cc's. I am starting over on a new routine, and am just so frustrated and don't want to keep buying new products.\n\ncurrent routine (I'm still patch testing and building):\n\nAM\n\nsplash with water + konjac\n\nLootatMe Jelly Sunscreen\n (ingredients: Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Orchid Extract, Crinum Asiaticum Extract, Dendrobium Phalaenopsis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide, Butylene Glycol, Betaine, Carbomer, Polyoxyethylene Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, 1, 2 - Hexanediol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Perfume)\n\nPM\n\nOCM with argan oil + cromollient SCE (have also tried hemp and mineral in the past)\n\nInnisfree anti-trouble gel cleanser \n\nBenton Snail Bee High Content Skin (patch testing) \n\nAnd I have EltaMD PM Therapy moisturizer to add in a couple weeks. I have large pores and used to have oily skin, although recently it has been a little flaky.  I have tried using H&S shampoo and noble zinc soap, thinking they may be fungal, but without any help. I have also used Paula's Choice AHA gel and BHA liquid, but they did not seem to affect them very much. In fact, the AHA created more cc's and the BHA caused me to break out in cysts. \n\nIs there any way cc's without any inflamed acne could be hormonal? I am not on BC. Or any other ideas? ",

It is the case sometimes but there are many cases where they're caused by the pore being clogged by sebum and dead skin cells, either because of an overproduction of sebum and/or your skin being bad at shedding skin cells effectively/'sticky' skin cells. for me, my closed comedones are hormonal (diagnosed hormonal by several derms bc of timing and placement), hormones classically causing an overproduction of sebum and those 'sticky' skin cells i mentioned. If chemical exfoliation didn't work for you you should consult a derm. Retinoids are usually prescribed for ppl with closed comedones. Retin-a reduced mine a lot but I still get them.

Butylene Glycol, Haematococcus Pluvialis Extract, Laminaria Japonica Extract, Laminaria extract, Carnitine, Ubiquinone, Collagen, Sodium acetylhyaluronate, Rose Hip Oil, Glyceryl Tricaprylate-caprate, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Octanediol*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Lightly scented, viscous fluid that finishes dewy and a bit sticky.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** I can't speak for any anti aging clams, since that was not one of my goals, but for hydration it does okay. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin since starting to use it. No significant plumping, and hydration wise, I've also noticed minimal effect.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** It's a hydrating lotion, so for me it comes right after double cleansing. It does not help with the absorption of other products, it does however make sticky products even stickier since it itself is a viscous, almost slimy feeling fluid. It absorbs much slower than some other lotions I've used in the past.\n\n**How long it has been used for:** Approx. 4 weeks\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** No, I will be trying other products.\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Overall, it filled a step in my routine as I was waiting for another lotion to come, but I feel that it does not deliver any particular effect in regards to plumping and even hydration. It was just... okay.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Review no.2*\n\n**Full Product Name:** Meishoku Ceracolla Super Moist Lotion\n\n**Skin Type/Skin Tone/Current Climate:** Combo/Fair Olive/Hot & Humid\n\n**Reason for Use:**Hydration & plumping\n\n**Product Size & Price:** [180ml/11,12‚Ç¨](https://www.amazon.de/Ceracolla-Skin-Lotion-180ml-Super/dp/B00IJSWSBE/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499675589&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=meishoku+ceracolla)\n\n**Packaging:** Drip bottle, very precise. You can easily measure out droplets to evade wasting product.\n\n**Ingredients:** (according to Cosdna)\n\n*Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene glycol, Methyl gluceth-10, PEG-75, Ceramide, Ceramide 3, CERAMIDE 6 II, Hydrolyzed collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Phytosphingosine, Glycosyl Trehalose, Hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium lauroyl lactylate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium chloride, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Propylparaben*\n\n**Product smell, texture & finish:** Scented fluid, ever-so-slightly viscous. Smells like a baby-oriented product, I find it very pleasant.\n\n**Product effects compared to claims:** Quite nice, I've noticed a few changes in hydration levels since starting its use. My skin also appears slightly plumper.\n\n**Where it fits in the routine & how it behaves with other products:** Another hydration lotion which comes right after double cleansing. It's a thin liquid that absorbs fairly easily and does not leave my skin feeling sticky unless I use it for the 3/7 skin method. \n\n**How long it has been used for:** 1 month\n\n**Has it been/will it be repurchased:** Yes, most likely, although I will continue searching for better products. This will work nicely as a secondary hydrating lotion (yes, I'm a product hoarder).\n\n**Concluding remarks:** Very pleasant and affordable. I particularly enjoy the fact that the liquid is not *too* viscous - it stands somewhere in the golden middle, which leaves my skin feeling nice and supple. Its effects have been no where near remarkable, but it is a reliable product for bringing in that extra hydration.\n\n\n\n*Note: I've also posted this in the review section in r/abdiscussion for the audience there. :)*\n",

[It's now finally up on the website](https://www.superdrug.com/search?text=calm+skin), meaning I can post about it without having to type out all the ingredients by hand ;)\n\nThe range has a night mask, a facial oil, a cleanser, a 'rescue gel', a hydrating spray and a 2-in-1 serum/moisturiser. They're all ¬£2.99, and they're all on buy 1 get 1 half price. I bought 4 products - the mask, the rescue gel, the spray and the serum/moisturiser. I skipped on the cleanser, as it has SLS, and I couldn't be bothered with the oil at the time, especially since I wanted even numbers because of the offer. \n\nI also emailed Superdrug's customer support to enquire about the % of niacinamide, as I was worried it would be insufficient. After some back-and-forth, the customer service rep contacted the new product team and got this response:\n\n\"I cannot give out specific information regarding our formulations but I can confirm that the percentage of niacinamide is >5% in all of the below.\"\n\nThe below being the four products I was asking about, I imagine. (The oil doesn't have niacinamide, btw - it's only soluble in water)\n\nAnyway, nice!\n\nAfter a month or so of testing on and off, here's my mini reviews of the ones that I got:\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin De-Stress Refreshing Facial Spritz 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-De-Stress-Refreshing-Facial-Spritz-100ml/p/741142)**\n\n**Ingredients:** Aqua, Glycerin, Niacinamide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Betaine, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Potassium Sorbate, Bisabolol, Propylene Glycol, Alcohol, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Sodium Hydroxide, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Moisturising spray? It's kind of weird. There's a slight oiliness to it, and a definite stickiness which is probably the large amount of glycerin. \n\n**Scent:** Definitely floral, vaguely chamomile-y\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, this is... a bit weird? I've mostly been using it as a hydrating toner. The difficulty is that it plays nice with some serums/moisturisers, but with others it seems to lead to bobbling. But I am rather bobble-prone, so it might just be me. Anyway, if I can get it to go on okay it definitely makes me feel more hydrated, particularly when I'm in the dry-aired office I keep complaining about. One day I was feeling kinda bored so I tried out the '7 skin' method by spraying it on every few minutes until it wouldn't absorb any more. I think I got to about six? It definitely hydrated my skin! And probably calmed it down as well. Is it a bad idea to put so much niacinamide on your skin? I don't know, but it's unlikely I'm going to be doing this on a regular basis.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Well, it's a very cheap, very hydrating toner, so probably.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Hydrating 2in1 Serum & Moisturiser 50ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Face-Cream/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Hydrating-2in1-Serum-%26-Moisturiser-50ml/p/741125)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Myristate, Niacinamide, ‚Ä≠Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Polyacrylamide, Butylene Glycol, ‚Ä≠Phenoxyethanol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Dimethiconol, Parfum, Betaine, Laureth-7, ‚Ä≠Bisabolol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, ‚Ä≠Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa ‚Ä≠Root Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower ‚Ä≠Extract, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, ‚Ä≠Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** So siliconey it's vaguely unnerving\n\n**Scent:** Heady floral, not unpleasant but kinda odd to find in this context. It's not at all chamomile-like? More of a tuberose, kinda luxe-y but definitely not one for people who don't like heavy scent\n\n**Overall Experience:** So, I think the reason it's described as a 2-in-1 is that there's SO MUCH SILICONE you really can't use much else with it or it will turn into a peeling gel, which is what it did to me several times. I think it might be a good thing for me in the summer when I need something very light, but right now I want to use a heavier, more wintery moisturiser and to layer stuff and this isn't meant for that at allll\n\n**Will I repurchase?** I don't know, let me try it out in the summer and see if I can find a sunscreen that'll play nice with it.\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Rescue Gel 15ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Rescue-Gel-15ml/p/741146)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Niacinamide, Citric Acid, Glycerin, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Salicylic Acid, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Trideceth-9, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum, Bisabolol, Potassium Sorbate, Allantoin, Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile)Flower Extract, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gel\n\n**Scent:** Alcohol\n\n**Overall Experience:** Okay, so in the cold light of day I should have looked at that ingredient list and run screaming. Why are they trying to combine salicylic acid (works best at pH <3.5) and niacinamide (becomes irritating at pH<4.5)? Why is the fourth ingredient citric acid? Did putting on an alcohol gel ever help a single spot?\nI did actually try this a couple of times and it did nothing much, which honestly is better than I should have expected, by rights it should have made my face fall off.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Nope\n\n**[Superdrug Calm Skin Overnight Face Mask 100ml](https://www.superdrug.com/Skin/Face/Cleansing-Lotion/Superdrug-Calm-Skin-Overnight-Face-Mask-100ml/p/741143)**\n\n**Ingredients:**Aqua, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, ‚Ä≠Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, Prunus ‚Ä≠Amygdalus Dulcis Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG-100 Stearate, ‚Ä≠Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Parfum, Sodium ‚Ä≠Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Betaine, ‚Ä≠Butyrospermum Parkii Butter, Isohexadecane, C13-14 ‚Ä≠Isoparaffin, Xanthan Gum, Polysorbate 80, Bisabolol, ‚Ä≠Ethylhexylglycerin, Alcohol, Laureth-7, Sodium Hyaluronate ‚Ä≠(Hyaluronic Acid), Cimicifuga Racemosa Root Extract, Sorbitan ‚Ä≠Oleate, Chamomilla Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, ‚Ä≠Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium ‚Ä≠Benzoate, Trisodium EDTA.\n\n**Texture:** Gloop.

It goes on nicely even over other stuff (eg Scinic Honey AIO), is nice and occlusive, smells okay and - the kicker - actually leaves my skin looking better in the morning, with red marks noticeably diminished. My only complaint is that it's tiny, considering you'll want to use a hefty glop of the stuff.\n\n**Will I repurchase?** Almost certainly",

Niacinamide isn't necessarily irritating in higher pH products, otherwise the vast majority of skincare products with niacinamide would be irritating, since most products aren't formulated at <pH 4.5. Alcohol denat. is a penetration enhancer and many people don't have issues with alcohol in skincare, particularly if their skin is in good condition to begin with and/or if they don't have alcohol in every single product. Citric acid is a pH adjuster. It's almost impossible just by looking at an ingredient list to be able to talk at length about the overall formula, and none of these ingredients in a normal product are 'face falling off' level of concern.

But I read somewhere that the colour is due to Ferulic acid and it‚Äôs okay to use, so I started using this. Lo & Behold, the results could be seen.\n\nThere‚Äôs a visible improvement in my pigmentation & acne marks. They have lightened to a great extent. I‚Äôve used Plum Vitamin C in the past, but it didn't really do much for my face. I enjoyed this product a lot more. \n\nI was going to stick to this until I came across an influencer post talking about oxidization where I commented about the colour of this product, & the influencer replied saying it‚Äôs wrong. I know, I know, we are not supposed to believe everything they say, but still it raised a doubt in my head enough for me to check their website & their IG page, wherein, the texture shots for this product shows a clear & transparent liquid.\n\nYou can imagine my confusion & worry, coz here I was using that product every day that it was nearly empty thinking it‚Äôs okay, but then also wondering why didn‚Äôt it bring out any reaction, instead it made my skin better. I DM‚Äôed their IG page with images asking for clarification, and their reply was this:\n\n_The product contains Ferulic Acid & Fullerenes that have the property to impart light yellowish color to their formulation. The colour is not an indication of any type of degradation. The degradation is signified by dark orange/brown color. Their Vitamin C serum is a stabilized Vitamin C derivative, which is further stabilized by Ferulic Acid & Vitamin E._\n\nI'm confused here coz (1) If the colour is meant to be yellow, why put texture shots with transparent colour liquid? and (2) Pigmentation got very less on using this product, so I'm guessing the product does work, but it does raise question on the credibility. \n\n**Repurchase:** Will research more and if all is clear, I see myself returning to this Serum for sure.\n\nUpdate:\nTurns out the light yellow colour of their formulation is due to Ferulic Acid, and not due to oxidisation. So as per the site, it's safe to use. I am on my second bottle now.",

    "body": "Day 4/7 this brand is underrated but their products work better than other brands I know of. So this brand is cruelty-free and vegan. It focuses more on sensitive skin, clean ingredients, hydration, and improving the skin Barrier in the long term. Any skin type can use the products and the main ingredient is the olive squalene and hyaluronic acid. They also use a blend of three different hyaluronic acid sizes (they have the smallest HA size for skincare in the world). If you've ever been to Sephora and saw that expensive and much-raved brand that uses squalene oil in everything, this is a cheaper alternative. The pH of everything is a 5.5. If you are looking for something for sensitive skin I'd think this is a good brand. \n\nDisclaimer: what worked for me might not work for you. I was gifted 3 of the products last year which got me interested in the entire line.\n\nEdit : some if the products have been reformulated so im not sure how it might impact the product. \n\nDual moist toning lotion 180ml:\n\nTo me, it's not worth it and there are definitely better hydrating toners worth your money. However, if every toner irritates you and you have dehydrated skin or just really sensitive skin you will like this. This is a good hypoallergenic hydrating basic toner. My friend has eczema and acne prone skin and loves this toner but now I got her wanting the pyunkang Yul's acne line. It's more viscous than water and dispensed well also comes sealed. \n\nIngredients - Water, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Arginine, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Ceramide NP, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Avena Sativa (Oat) Meal Extract, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Sodium Citrate, Disodium EDTA, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Citric Acid, Tetradecane, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\n‚ù§Ô∏èDual moist comfort cream 75ml:\n\nMy favourite daytime moisturiser works well in winter and summer it's perfect if your oil-water balance is out if wack. In the summer is adjust excessive sebum so I sweat less on my face but keeps me hydrated in the winter time. Feels like a gel, absorbs fairly quickly. It's a basic essential. Uses panthenol, madecassoside, and Allantoin to soothe, repair and strengthen skin. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Methyl Gluceth-10, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Dimethicone, Squalane (Olive Squalane), Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Ceramide NP, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Glyceryl Stearate, Bis-Diglyceryl Polyacyladipate-2, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Dimethiconol, Octyldodecanol, Dodecane, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Sorbitan Isostearate, Polysorbate 60, Octadecane, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, PEG-20 Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Hydroxide, Tetradecane, Disodium EDTA, PEG-100 Stearate, Polyglutamic Acid, Tocopheryl Acetate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Linoleic Acid\n\n‚ù§Ô∏èDual moist hyaluronic Essence 100ml:\n\nclaims to rapidly hydrate even dry or sensitive skin without irritation. It does work. One if my favourite essences an alternative to the cosrx snail in terms of the hydrating effects your skin gets. If you are vegan and want the hydrating effects and healing effects of Centella Asiatica and vitamin E from tocopherol this could be great for you. My skin was soothed and cooled down, quickly. Absorbs fairly fast feels and hydrating on the skin. \n\nEdit: I repurchased this and didn't notice any actual change to the product still worked. I tried like putting drops of both on my face and I guess the new formula kept my skin more hydrated. But it still works the same but if you have an allergy to anything in the new formulation I'd pass. \n\nIngredients \n\nWater, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Panthenol, Collagen, Madecassoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate\n\nUpdated formula:\nWater,¬†PentyleneGlycol,¬†Squalane, Polyglycerin-3, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia¬†TahitensisFlower, Tocopherol, CamelliaSinensisLeaf¬†Extract, Chamomilla¬†Recutita(Matricaria) FlowerExtract, CentellaAsiatica¬†Extract, AloeBarbadensis¬†LeafExtract, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Glycerin,Cetearyl¬†Olivate,Sorbitan¬†Olivate, C14-22 Alcohols, Xanthan Gum, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside,PulsatillaKoreanaExtract,¬†ZanthoxylumPiperitum¬†Fruit Extract,UsneaBarbata(Lichen) Extract, Arginine, Gaultheria¬†Procumbens(Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nFluid oil 30ml:\n\nIf you have TO squalene oil I'll pass on this one they both have 100% organic squalene oil. This one is more cosmetically elegant but save $30 while you can if you are interested in squalene oil by itself. \n\nEmollient extra comfort cream 75ml\n\nContains panthenol too (D-panthenol contains vitamin B5) it feels sticky when applied. If your skin is dry or dehydrated or if you have combination skin but live in a dry climate you will enjoy this. It's a really heavy cream and I dislike the feeling since it takes a while to absorb but my skin doesn't feel hydrated. \n\nIngredients : \n\nWater, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Glycerin, Squalane(Olive Squalane), Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Madecassoside, Allantoin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Arginine, Ceramide NP, Camellia Japonica Seed Oil, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Carbomer, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Wax, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Extract, Dodecane, Isohexadecane, Isoeicosane, Octadecane, Tetradecane, Dimethicone, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Hydroxide, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butylene Glycol, Glucose, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Linoleic Acid\n\nNew formulation - Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Panthenol, Pentylene Glycol, Squalane, Polyglyceryl-3 Stearate,Cetearyl Olivate, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Canola Oil, Xanthan Gum, Zanthoxylum Piperitum Fruit Extract, Pulsatilla Koreana Extract, Usnea Barbata (Lichen) Extract, Gaultheria Procumbens (Wintergreen) Leaf Extract\n\nEmollient cleansing bar\n\nDoesn't contain any harsh sulfates or anything but I don't like cleansing bars in general. Good for body and face and it won't dry your skin out if you have oily - combo skin. Honestly, there are so many better cleansing gels/milks/foams that I think work better than this bar. It's cleansing properties are abysmal at best and it struggles to remove even the minimal makeup I wear occasionally. My friend hated this too and pointed out to me that looks like it can easily get bacteria on the product. \n\nIngredients:\n\nTriticum Vulgare Wheat Starch, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Potassium Lauryl Sulfate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Aqua, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Avocado Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Calophyllum Inophyllum, Olea Europaea, Squalidae, Sodium Hyaluronate, D-Panthenol, Tocopherol Acetate, Glycerin, Spinacia Olearacea Extract, Chamaecyparis Obtusa Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Sapindus Trifoliatus, Apium Graveolens (Celery) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Spinacia Oleracea L., Chorella, Allantoin, Olive Butter\n\nI think they are. Trying to do something cool with their brand but because what they focus on are pretty basic stuff not all people may like it. I think the dual moist comfort cream is a great moisturiser for any skin type and the essence and toner are good items. However, by making products like the cleansing bar or their clay mask (which you can't purchase anywhere anymore)... By only using this brand in my routine my skin looked dull despite being hydrated. My friend who tried some of the products with me saw her skin Barrier become healthier over the next few months and her sensitivity to products decreased slightly. Anybody with a sensitive skin type or dehydrated - dry skin would enjoy trying some of the line. You can get the brand on stylekorean.com, yesstyle, roseroseshop, or ohholly\n\nHope this was helpful i feel like it was kind of a messy review üòÖ\n\nEdit: It remind me of the ordinary because of the reformulation changes and how they use olive squalene (squalene derived from olives) instead of shark squalene to make it cruelty free.

    "body": "I meant to put i made a 2% BHA exfoliant not toner, but I can't edit the title TT\n\nHey y'all!\n\nFor the longest time I've seen and heard from people struggling with dissolving salicylic acid and keeping it dissolved. So I did a bunch of research and even helped someone fix a there formula and they gave me feedback saying the SA had not recrystalized so far (YAY!) [This should be it](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/ibfy8b/need_help_simple_questions_basic_beginners_help/g20l949?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3). If I linked the wrong thread just tell me. I also shared this somewhere don't remember where.\n\n\nAnyway, I came here to share my thought process and see if anyone had any extra ideas so that others could benefit. I didn't really know how to start with this because while I got the idea from Paula's choice I didn't really make te formula from that... but I'll start with Paula's choice.\n\n\nPaula's choice 2% BHA Exfoliant:\nWater (Aqua), Methylpropanediol (hydration), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Salicylic Acid (beta hydroxy acid/exfoliant), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Camellia Oleifera Leaf Extract (green tea/skin calming/antioxidant), Sodium Hydroxide (pH balancer), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer).\n\n\nPaula's choice Regular Strength Anti-Redness Exfoliating Solution With 2% Salicylic Acid Ingredient list:\nWater (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol (hydration), Pentylene Glycol (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Glycerin (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Panthenol (hydration), PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer (texture-enhancing), Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration), Glycereth-26 (texture-enhancing), Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer).\n\nAs you can see I linked two ingredient lists for 2 bha products but formula is more based on the first one. I linked the second one as a reference due to the fact that it used way more glycols and that plays into my dupe?\n\n\nAnyway: the Paula's choice 2% BHA exfoliant ingredient overview:\n\nWater: water\n\nMethylpropanediol: humectant, solvent, helps with absorption of Salicylic acid. \n(I have no earthly idea where to get this ingredient, so I'm not including it at all)\n\nButylene Glycol: humectant, solvent\n(I used Propylene glycol instead of this)\n\nSalicylic Acid: the reason were here\n(This is going to be dissolved in the propylene glycol)\n\nPolysorbate 20: helps stabilize the Salicylic acid and keep it from recrystalizing\n(Gonna use this anywhere from 2 to 5%)\n\nCamellia Oleifera Leaf Extract: Green tea extract\n(Not necessary, but nice. You could use the powdered at 0.5% or the liquid at like 1 to 2%)\n\nSodium Hydroxide: ph adjuster\n(I would use this at the end to adjust the ph)\n\nTetrasodium EDTA: stabilizer, chelating agent\n(You could leave or keep this in. The Paula'schoice BHA doesn't have a preservativebecause of the high amount of humectant/glycols in their formula I believe)\n\nNow you are starting to see why this isn't exactly a dupe.\n\n\nNow let's start explaining. Making cosmetics says that SA is 3 to 6% soluble in Propylene glycol. That means you need to make a salicylic acid solution in Propylene glycol at 6%. This 6% SA solution in Propylene glycol (were just gonna say PG cuz I'm tired of typing this out) needs to be used at 33% of the total formulation to get 2% salicylic acid in our formula. Does this make sense?\n\nNow here is the formula that's not really a dupe that I posted in the thread link I shared earlier.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n5% Polysorbate 20 (you might have to lower this depending) (you could also replace this with poly 80, peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil)\n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 61% in this case)\n\n\nThe sodium citrate is used to help make sure the SA doesn't recrystalize and could also function as a ph adjuster. The polysorbate was used at 5% cuz I was terrified it would recrystalize, you could lower this, but definitely use at least 2%). I did not mention a preservative in the formula i gave her because I forgot. I would put one in because I don't trust my formulation skills or sanitation. Replace some of the water with a preservative of your choice. \n\nThe original person a made this formula for said it had a greasy feel. This is definitely due to the high amount of PG and may be partly due to the polysorbate 20. But it didn't recrystalize so that's a win??? The skin feel can definitely be improved upon though lol.\n\n\nNow here is a version I've been trying to work on that is slightly more like a dupe (if you squint): I have yet to try this.\n\n2% Salicylic acid\n\n31% propylene glycol\n(Or 33% of a 6% salicylic acid solution)\n\n1% Sodium citrate\n\n3% Polysorbate 20 (I lowered this)\n\n0.5% powdered green tea extract (or 1 to 2% liquid)\n\n0.2% Tetrasodium EDTA \n\nAnd then use water to 100 (or 62.3% in this case)\n\n\nA really important tip is to make sure the Exfoliant is above 3 in ph. The Paula's choice one has a ph between 3.2 and 3.8. If the ph of it is too low the SA will recrystalize. Please remember this. In fact I remember reading somewhere at ph lower than 3.5 you often get SA precipitating out of the solution...\n\nNow can adjustments be made? Absolutely üíØ. Please play with this. I really want to olimprove the skin feel of this product. Now that I've found that it doesn't recrystalize with this, I plan on trying to slowly lower the amount of propylene glycol to see how low I can take it before the formula starts hating me üòÜ. \n\n(And I want to make a gel out of it. Like a thicker serum type with more good skin feeling ingredients. Maybe use something like sepigel 305 so I can add silicones and get a gel cream. Can it even handle acids... Hmm)\n\n[Here is a link to a chemists corner thread](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/comment/20464#Comment_20464) that helped me a lot.\n\nYou could add other humectants too. This could be very helpful with hydration and helpful in keeping SA solibulized. I wanna see if I can add glycerin and socium lactate. Allantoin, other extracts, and etc!!! THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER ( absolutely wrongnuse of this quote...)\n\nYou can buy pre solubulized SA from making Cosmetics if you don't wanna go through all this trouble ( I'm currently stuck with 100g of SA so...) you could say flip it all and use alcohol. Or you could use octyldodecanol (i think that's what it's called) also sold at making cosmetics. Better than PG worse than alcohol. \n\nFeel free to share, give advice, but please point back to his thread so we can get some knowledge üòâ. I will be posting an updated formula with more goodness added and a better skin feel... in the near future.... honestly I remember....\n\nNext on my list? Urea. It shall be conquered. I will make a basic formula out of you that I can share. I will. Once you come in the mail üòÄ",

    "body": "[PICTURES!](http://imgur.com/a/1mrcR)\n\nHere's my redditview on **Fuji Bee Venom Cream** (First formal review!)\n\n The seller I bought through was on Ebay.ca and can be found [HERE](http://m.ebay.ca/itm/FUJI-Bee-Venom-Cream-For-Reduce-Wrinkles-and-Fine-Lines-Immediate-Face-Firm-10g-/321726819632?varId=510629229001&txnId=1657617508011) I highly recommend them.\n\n\nFuji Bee Venom Cream is a lightweight gel cream (similar to the Mizon Snail Recovery Gel Cream).  As you pat it in, it absorbs VERY quickly and does not leave a tacky residue. It feels a little sticky just as it's finishing soaking in, but that goes away within 30 seconds. The finish is matte and dry to the touch. I even put a second coat over it and same results. The texture is very pleasant and not at all goopy or slimy(as I can find the Mizon to be)  \n\n It smells pleasantly like honey with undertones of a sort of generic wildflower scent and peaches.. I find the smell inoffensive and mild. While I don't notice it lingering on my face, it sticks around faintly when I sniff my hand.\n I am scent-sensitive, I have what is considered to be moderate/severe asthma and this product did not cause any kind of flare up. I also sometimes develop mild hives from some types of fragrances and had no reaction.\n\nI have really liked the results from using this product so far. It plays nicely with everything else in my routine and is a nice boost for my dehydrated skin this winter without feeling too heavy. The hydration is light and not occlusive. This didn't stop or slow any of my other products absorbing. I find that my fine lines were less noticeable and experienced a brightening effect. My skin is left feeling soft and lightly hydrated, it makes my skin happy haha\n\nThe Fuji Bee Venom Cream line also has a serum and a sleeping pack. I have not tried them but if they're anything like this product I'm going to like it!\n This product comes in a 30g jar or 10g resealable pouches. The packaging is pretty and sturdy. Even the pouches have a well made screw cap.\n\nNow; something that some people may not like is there is a noticeable gold shimmer in this product. Personally I like it and think it looks pretty on it's own or with makeup. I was kind of suprised at how much shimmer was in this product at first. The particles are very fine and do not feel gritty on application. It is quite shimmery but is so fine that it doesn't make you look like a disco ball. \nMy husband despises sparkles and even he said \"that looks nice\" and said it's not disco-ball-y.  You could always use it  as a night-only part of your routine. Disclosure: I might be biased. I love highlighters, it's my favorite type of makeup :P\n\nYMMV but I like it :) I will be repurchasing this item and will be using the same Ebay seller when I do. They were great to deal with.\n While there are some potential acne irritants in here, I didn't experience any issues with my VERY blemish prone skin. There are some very good ingredients in here and was enough for me to take the plunge.\n\n\n\n**INGREDIENTS AS LISTED** *AQUA, PEG-40, HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CARBOMER, GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, PANTHENOL, BACILLUS/SOYBEAN/FOLIC ACID FERMENT EXTRACT, BEE VENOM, HONEY EXTRACT, PANAX GINSENG ROOT EXTRACT, PROPOUS EXTRACT, POLYSORBATE 20, ROYAL JELLY,SACCHARIDE ISOMERATE,  ALOE BARBADENSIS LEAF JUICE, NIACINAMIDE, SODIUM HYALURONATE, TRIETHANOLAMINE, FRAGRANCE, EDTA, BENZISOTHIAZOUNONE, METHYUSOTHIAZOUNONE, Ci 77480*",

    "body": "Hi everyone! Today I'd love to share with you my review on the Sana Namerakahonpo 6 in 1 Moisture Gel. I thought about just adding a small mini review on the weekly Monday thread but honestly, I think this product deserves a post of its own. This gel cream has quickly made its way onto my list of HG's and let me explain why.\n\n\nMy skin type: oily + with hormonal acne but not really sensitive\n\nAge: 24\n\nClimate I'm in: cold Europe\n\n\nSo last week I *finally* finished my Innisfree Orchid Enriched Cream and even though it smelled amazing and felt really velvety on my skin, it was way too heavy for my skin type. I think this cream is more suitable for people with dry skin who are looking for a medium-to-heavy cream but who don't mind fragrances. I, however, prefer light, gel moisturizers that immediately sink into the skin without leaving an oily residue but still provide moisture (unfortunately the Innisfree cream did leave a bit of an oily feeling on the skin).\n\n\nAnyways, a couple of weeks ago I was lucky enough to travel to Japan and let me just tell ya, I am so happy I asked the sales lady of Ainz & Tulpe to help me choose a moisturizer for oily skin, because if I hadn't I might not have bought this amazing Sana gel cream.\n\n\n\nThis was the [product description](http://www.qoo10.sg/item/%EF%BC%B3%EF%BC%A1%EF%BC%AE%EF%BC%A1-SANA-NAMERAKAHONPO-ALL-IN-ONE-MOISTURE-JELLY-GEL-6-IN-1-NATURAL/514050405?css_mode=preview&title_id=title_popup) I found online (since the packaging of the cream has absolutely no English writing on it):\n\n\n\nJelly extra moisture gel that melts at skin temperature!\n\n6 in 1:\n\n1) Emulsion\n\n2) Mask\n\n3) Skin Toner\n\n4) Cream\n\n5) Serum\n\n6) Make up primer\n\n\n\nJapan's No.1 Brand for Soya Skin Care Series!\n\n\n\n‚ùå No color\n\n‚ùå No fragrance\n\n‚ùå No mineral oil\n\n\nContains isoflavone and collagen which help to whiten your skin and improve the absorption of skin for supple and beautiful skin!\n\n\nSome of the benefits of this cream include: moisturizing, anti-aging, brightening, antioxidants, anti- inflammation, sebum control and it enhances the production of collagen and hyaluronic acid!\n\n\nIngredients list:\n\nWATER, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, GLYCERIN, ETHYLHEXANOATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE,TRIETHYLHEXANOIN,PEG-60 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL,PEG-240/HDI COPOLYMER BIS-DECYLTETRADECETH-20 ETHER,TREHALOSE,PHENOXYETHANOL,BEHENYL ALCOHOL,SODIUM STEAROYL GLUTAMATE,ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, TOCOPHEROL, LACTOBACILLUS/SOYMILK FERMENT FILTRATE,PENTASODIUM PENTETATE,SODIUM HYDROXIDE,  BUTYLENE GLYCOL,ALCOHOL,GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) PROTEIN, GLYCINE SOJA (SOYBEAN) SEED EXTRACT\n\n\n\n\nAmazing right? Talk about a multifunctional product! So, for the past couple of days, I've been applying this cream in the morning as my daytime moisturizer and I have to admit I am completely amazed by how light, yet moisturizing it is. Right now where I live it's winter and to leave my house and enter the cold weather, I usually prepare my face with at least 1 layer of hydrating toner, 1 essence and 1 serum but this morning all I did was cleanse with the Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam, then I applied eye cream, then this Sana gel cream and finally sunscreen. Final result? I haven't noticed a single flake on my somewhat dry winter skin. My skin just feels so incredibly soft and moisturized. Also, the redness on my cheeks was less visible today.\n\nHonestly, I would highly recommend this product for people who have oily skin and are looking for a lightweight moisturizer/emulsion, people who are looking for deep moisture or for those of you who love all-in-one products.\n\n\nRating: 5/5\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this compact review. If you feel that this review was unnecessary or irrelevant, please let me know and I can gladly delete it.\n",

One common complaint of all is how One size of sheet mask doesn't fit every face, but this one was perfect for me.\n\nBut that's not why I'm writing this review. It's because post usage, till few days, my skin looked so plump.

    "body": "I've tried many SPF lip balms over the years.  My biggest complaint is that so many are less than SPF 30 and some are not even broad spectrum.  Why insist on SPF 30 for your face but use something less on your lips?  Lips receive UV exposure too and are a common place to get skin cancer.  \n\nAdditionally, I found that many SPF lip products have a \"chemical taste\" and/or irritate my throat.  So I started excluding ones that contain avobenzone (which I suspect, but am not certain, is responsible for this).\n\nHere is a review for three that I've used that met my requirements.  Photos are at the end of the post.\n\n**Elta MD Lip Balm SPF 31** Active Ingredients: 7.5% Octinoxate, 5.0% Zinc oxide.  Inactive Ingredients: Petrolatum, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol,  Lauryl Laurate, Purified Water, Flavor, Polyethylene, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cera Alba, Glycerin, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Glyceryl Behenate, Microcrystalline Wax, Quercetin, Thiotic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Hydrolyzed Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum, Glyceryl Stearate, Caesalpinia Spinosa Gum.\n\nContains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.   This has a vaguely minty scent, though it contains no mint or other flavoring.  I would not repurchase this because I don't like the oily base that it is in.  It comes out of the tube as a soft solid, but turns very oily on my lips.  The result is a very glossy appearance and some of the product gets into my mouth. The fact that it melts when hot worries me; I fear the ingredients may separate and no longer be evenly distributed (for example, if you keep it in your pocket). The tube specifies that it should not be exposed to temperatures greater than 103 degrees F.  Leaves my lips lighter and very glossy (see picture at the end of the post).  Price is $10 on Dermstore for a 0.28 oz tube.\n\n**Cotz SPF 45 lip balm**  Active: Titanium Dioxide 4.0%, Zinc Oxide 5.5%.\nInactive: Alumina, Aluminum Hydroxide, Aluminum Stearate, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Cetearyl Isononanoate, Dicaprylate-Caprate, C12-15 Alkyls Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Wax, Hexadecanol, Hexadecyl Laurate, Iron Oxides, Ozokerite, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Oil, Flavor.\n\nThis is a physical sunscreen lip balm that is tinted brown.  Yes, brown.  The brown tint works surprisingly well, though I wish they'd come out with a pink option as well.  I don't find this to be drying at all. Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E.  It smells a bit like candy, but the scent dissipates quickly.  Tastes how it smells, but only if i lick my lips.  I've gone through several tubes of this because I like it so much. It holds up fine in my pocket, though the label always gets rubbed off eventually.  Looks brown on lips but not overly so (see picture at the end of the post). I've purchased on the Cotz website, as well as on Dermstore.  It's about $6-7 for a 0.14 oz tube.\n\n**Ultrasun UltraLip SPF 30**  Ingredients: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Ethylhexyl Stearate, Paraffinum Liquidum, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ozokerite, Paraffin, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, PEG-8 Beeswax, Cera Alba, Cocoglycerides, Cyclopentasiloxane, Candelilla Cera, Ceresin, Dipropylene Glycol Dibenzoate, Limnanthes Alba Seed Oil, Cyclohexasiloxane, Ribes Nigrum Seed Oil, PPG-15 Stearyl Ether Benzoate, Lecithin, Copernicia Cerifera Cera, Tocopheryl Acetate, Butyrospermum Parkii Extract, Aroma, Tocopherol, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Oleate, Citric Acid.\n\nThis is a European product, so the percentages of active ingredients are not listed out.  We can see it contains octinoxate, Tinosorb S, and Uvinul A.  Contains antioxidants Vitamin C and E. Contains blackcurrent and meadowfoam oils. Because of the UVA circle, we know the PPD is at least 10, or equivalent to PA+++.  It says it contains aroma, but I smell nothing.  It feels like a regular lip balm, has a very nice texture and no taste at all.  I am not sure yet if it is drying (the weather is getting colder here, so it's hard to tell).  I purchased it on Feelunique and it's $7-8 for a 4.8 g tube.  I like it so far and would purchase again.\n\n[Photos](https://imgur.com/a/riyNr).",

Let's cry together.\n\nI have a rather rare (or so did dermatologists tell me) allergy to castor oil, most likely listed as hydrogenated castor oil in the ingredients. I'm allergic to lanolin alcohol too, I've lived with that. I've had to purge stuff when I found out. Explains why my eczema never healed when I was a kid(turns out Aquaphor and Eucerin are not my friend). Licorice allergy sucks too these days but I've managed. But castor oil. Dealing with castor oil is a whole new level.\n\nCastor oil has invaded every department in beauty. Hair, skincare, makeup. They love it so much they decided to replace everything with it. They sprinkle it in like it's salt and pepper. 4 out of 5 products I would get excited about will have it, and that last one won't work for my needs.\n\nI feel like I'm playing beauty product hunting in extreme difficulty. I can't even trust any fragrance free products marketed for sensitive skin, they are enemies in disguise! Same with hair salons, both for color and even just haircuts. Every beauty product are like those mimic treasure chests in games that attack you when you approach them all excited!\n\nMy beloved deodorant of five years? Ninja swapped castor oil into the formula(I trusted you dove!). I didn't even realize it for half a year and just thought I was having some weird eczema phase. I use Almay one now (the only one that won't itch me at this moment) but it doesn't last.\n\nOk your turn, what common ingredient do you react to that makes your life hell? Let it out.

I have recently gathered all the info on Salicylic Acid that I have in my personal knowledge base and decided to publish it as a guidelines that can be referenced in the future.\n\nI decided to do this because question about Salicylic Acid appear from time to time in the sub and I also see some wrong information from YouTube videos when people are trying to formulate it. Hope this information would be helpful for you!\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nI AM NOT A CHEMIST!\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR!\n\nI DON'T HAVE ANY SKINCARE, CHEMISTRY, MEDICAL OR BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION!\n\nAll the information is gathered over the internet sources and some is referenced (+ a bit of personal DIY experience). I am open to any corrections and additions. Please leave them in comments and I'll include them in this article.\n\n# General info\n\n>**BE CAUTIOS! IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY TO ASPIRIN THEN YOU MOST LIKELY HAVE ALLERGY TO SALICYLIC ACID**\n\n**INCI:** Salicylic Acid  \n**Type:** Acid, BHA  \n**Functions:** Exfoliation, Anti-inflammatory  \n**Treats:** Acne, Blackheads, Keratosis Pilaris, Sebum production  \n**Usage rate:** 0.5 - 3.0%  \n**Usable pH range:** 3.5  \n**pKa:** 2.97  \n**Solubility:** Alcohols, Glycols, Oils, Surfactants  \n**Molar mass:** 138.121 g/mol (Daltons)\n\n# Usage rate\n\nDue to possible poisoning, based on European regulations ([SCCS - Final Opinion on Salicylic acid](https://health.ec.europa.eu/latest-updates/sccs-final-opinion-salicylic-acid-2023-06-09_en)) maximum usage rates of Salicylic Acid in skincare products are:\n\n* 3% in wash-off hair products;\n* 2% in other leave-on products, excluding the mentioned below;\n* 0.5% for body lotions, eye shadows, mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks, oral products and non-spray deodorants.\n\n>**!DANGER!**  \nBetter to avoid formulating sprayable products due to possible inhalation. Also, special attention is required for the use of SA in eye products, as it shows potential of causing serious damage to eyes.\n\nUSA most likely has the same regulation on SA. It is also an OTC drug in USA and should be labeled in a special section of the product packaging.\n\nSouth Korea has even stricter rules for direct SA. The maximum usage rate is up to 0.5% for any product type ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2d613u/maximum_bha_in_korea_05/)). That's why Korean skincare products often use **Willow Bark Extract** and/or **Betaine Salicylate** as active ingredient instead.\n\n# Solubility\n\n# Water\n\nAlthough Salicylic Acid is a polar molecule it is poorly soluble in water (which is also a polar molecule), because the polar parts of the molecule attached to the bigger non-polar part of it, affecting the properties. ([Chemical Book](https://www.chemicalbook.com/article/the-polar-and-non-polar-characteristics-in-the-structure-of-salicylic-acid.htm)).\n\n# Depending on temperature\n\nSolubility in water depending on the temperature ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid)):\n\n|Water temperature (¬∞C)|Solubility (g/L)|Solubility (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|0|1.24|0.124|\n|25|2.48|0.248|\n|40|4.14|0.414|\n|75|17.41|1.741|\n|100|77.79|7.779|\n\nWhich means if you take 100ml of water under room temperature (25 ¬∞C) you can dissolve up to 0.248g of SA in it. If you boil the water it will take up to 7.779g of SA, but precipitates when you cool the solution down.\n\n# Depending on pH\n\nSolubility increases with increasing pH, because part of SA becomes \"neutralized\" and therefore more soluble in water. Can be estimated for any given pH using the pKa of Salicylic Acid:\n\n* At a pH of 2.97 (pKa): 50% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form\n* At a pH of 4: 90% of SA is in \"neutralized\" form.\n* At a pH of 5: about 99% is in \"neutralized\" form.\n\nHere is a free acid calculator (not only for BHA) at any pH level: [LabMuffin Beauty](https://labmuffin.com/free-acid-calculator-for-exfoliants-at-specific-ph-levels/). WIth this spreadsheet you can calculate how much Salicylic Acid will be in protonated form (not neutralized, free acid) under any pH.\n\n# Betaine\n\nDue to strict regulation of SA in Korea and high popularity of Korean skincare products, new ingredient has been researched and introduced as a gentler alternative to SA called **Betaine Salicylate**.\n\nBetaine forms a hydrogen-bonded complex with Salicylic Acid rather than a salt, which increases its solubility. Formulated with it at pH 3.0-3.5, with a 2:1 molar ratio (1.7g to 1g) of Betaine to Salicylic Acid and it remains relatively soluble. Betaine mixed with Salicylic Acid at the right proportion results in a liquid ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/do-sodium-citrate-or-betaine-react-with-salicylic-acid/)).\n\n# Surfactants\n\nGreat solubility in many surfactants, especially the ones that start with \"Sodium\" (Sodium Laureth Sulfate etc). That's why formulating a face wash or shampoo with Salicylic Acid is not a big problem and won't be covered here.\n\nAccording to [\"The solubilization of salicylic acid by a series of non-ionic surfactants\"](https://academic.oup.com/jpp/article-abstract/23/Supplement_1/241S/6200573) the likely mechanism is somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation.\n\nBased on [\"Solubilization of Salicylic Acid by Polysorbate 80 as Determined by Solubility Titration\"](https://jpharmsci.org/article/S0022-3549(15)33858-2/abstract), to completely solubilize SA in water the ratio between SA and:\n\n* **Polysorbate 80** should be 0.15\n* **Polysorbate 20** should be 0.13\n\nTherefore to solubilize 2% of SA in water required around 13.4% of Polysorbate 80 or around 15.4% of Polysorbate 20.\n\n# Ethanol (Alcohol)\n\nSalicylic Acid is highly soluble in **Ethanol**, that's why many companies use Ethanol as a main solvent or a co-solvent of the product.\n\nUnder normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg Ethanol, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Propylene glycol\n\n**Propylene Glycol** is often used as a solvent and penetration enhancer in skincare formulations. Solubility rate of SA in Propylene Glycol is 248.63 g/L or 257.64 g/kg Propylene Glycol, which means 25.76g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Propylene Glycol.\n\nSolubility is highly affected by presence of water.\n\n# Sodium Citrate and Sodium Lactate\n\n**Sodium Citrate** and **Sodium Lactate** are salts of weak Citric Acid and Lactic Acid respectfully. Since SA is a stronger acid, when mixed it can replace Citric or Lactic acid and gives **Sodium Salicylate**, which is highly soluble in water:\n\n>Sodium Citrate + Salicylic Acid -> Sodium Citrate + Sodium Salicylate + Citric Acid + Salicylic Acid\n\nMentioned salts are not usable as solubilization enhancers since they basically neutralize SA, but they are good buffering agents to prevent SA recrystallization in case of pH drift or temperature change.\n\nSuggested ratio of salt to SA is 1:10 ([Chemists Corner](https://chemistscorner.com/cosmeticsciencetalk/discussion/precipitation-and-gel-incompatibility-salicylic-acid-serum/)), meaning for 2% of Salicylic Acid include 0.2% of the buffer.\n\n# Mixed solvency approach\n\nAccording to [Hydrotropy, mixed hydrotropy, and mixed solvency as trending concept for solubilization of lipophilic drugs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128144558000050) and [\"Mixed-solvency approach\" - Boon for solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44298504_Mixed-solvency_approach_-_Boon_for_solubilization_of_poorly_water-soluble_drugs), a mix of different solvents usually gives better solubility than if one pure solvent is used of the same content. This allows to decrease the content of each individual solvent in the formula leading to a more elegant product.\n\nSolubility in mixes of Water, Propylene Glycol and Ethanol was studied in [Solubility prediction of Salicylic Acid in Water-Ethanol-Propylene Glycol mixtures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16649546/). The study defined a formula to determine how much Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in a custom mixture of this solvents and also proves mixed solvency approach.\n\nHere is a calculator spreadsheet that I made based on the study: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqJaMGAa1Wu3BKck55dkqUWt4ACU_FPo). Fill in percentage of Ethanol and Propylene Glycol in the mixture (water will be calculated automatically) and you'll see the solubility calculated.\n\n# Substitutions\n\nThere are alternative ingredients that are readily soluble in water and can be used to avoid the hassle with Salicylic Acid itself:\n\n* **Sodium Salicylate**. Salt of Salicylic Acid. Very soluble in water. There is a publication in cosmetic journal ([Exfoliation for sensitive skin with neutralized salicylic acid](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2494.2009.00501_2.x)) showing that Sodium Salicylate is as effective as actual Salicylic Acid in terms of exfoliation. But the methodology of studies are not disclosed and anti-acne effect is not tested. Used in [Revox Just Salicylic Acid 2% For Scalp](https://incidecoder.com/products/revox-just-salicylic-acid-2-for-scalp)  and [Keve Salicylic Acid 2% Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/keve-salicylic-acid-2-serum)\n* **WIllow Bark Extract**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Pyunkang Yul Acne Dressing Mask Pack](https://incidecoder.com/products/pyunkang-yul-acne-dressing-mask-pack);\n* **Betaine Salicylate**. Used in many Korean products, e.g. [COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cosrx-bha-blackhead-power-liquid-4) and [Cos De BAHA S2 Salicylic Acid BHA 2% Liquid](https://incidecoder.com/products/cos-de-baha-s2-salicylic-acid-bha-2-liquid);\n* **Salicylic Acid in Cocamidopropyl Dimethylamine** solution. Used in [The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution](https://incidecoder.com/products/the-ordinary-salicylic-acid-2-solution)  and [Revolution 2% Salicylic Acid Serum](https://incidecoder.com/products/revolution-2-salicylic-acid-serum);\n* Spray dried **Salicylic Acid with Acacia Senegal Gum**. Used in [Somethinc 2% BHA Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment](https://incidecoder.com/products/somethinc-2-bha-salicylic-acid-acne-treatment) and [Attivi Puri Salicylic Acid + Niacinamide Lotion](https://incidecoder.com/products/attivi-puri-salicylic-acid-niacinamide-lotion)\n\n# Formulation strategy\n\nBased on the data above, the strategy of formulating a stable SA serum is:\n\n1. Formulate with not more than 2% of Salicylic Acid to meet requirements for skincare products;\n2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. At this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed);\n3. Use several solvents (glycols, ethanol) for better solubility based on mixed solvency approach;\n4. Include some mild non-ionic surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to form micelles and encapsulate part of the acid;\n5. Use Betaine to convert part of SA to Betaine Salicylate and adjust the pH;\n6. Add some weak acid salt (Sodium Citrate, Sodium Lactate) to prevent precipitation in case of pH drift or temperature change;\n7. Since our target is low pH, maybe Ethanol content and maybe high salt content be sure to use a tolerant gelling agent. Sepimax Zen, Xanthan Gum, Hydroxyethylcellulose or HMW Hyaluronic acid are good choices, while Aristoflex, Carbomer, Lecigel won't thicken the solution.\n8. Avoid natural extracts (or add at 0.01% amount for marketing claims) and ingredients that in low pH will hydrolyze over time and shift the pH level up (Niacinamide, Urea etc).\n\n# Example of a commercial product\n\n[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water, **Ethanol**, *Salicylic Acid*, **Propylene Glycol**, **Betaine**, **Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol, **Polysorbate 20**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n* Used Ethanol and Propylene Glycol as solvents\n* Used Polysorbate 20 and PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil to boost solubility (but most likely to solubilize the extracts)\n* Used Betaine as a hydrotrope tp boost the solubility;\n* Used Sodium Lactate as a buffering salt.\n\n# Example of formulas\n\n# Very basic waterless solution\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Propylene Glycol|98%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n\nThe easiest and fastest approach is to dissolve Salicylic Acid directly in Propylene Glycol.\n\nPros:\n\n* No water - no solubility and recrystallization problems;\n* No water - no pH;\n* No water - no need for preservation;\n* Easy and fast to prepare;\n* Damn strong since whole SA content is in free acid form.\n\nCons:\n\n* Unpleasant to wear, PG has very oily texture (can be balanced with Ethanol to some degree);\n* Runny texture, hard to thicken;\n* Damn strong. Yes, it is not a typo, this can be both - advantage and disadvantage.\n\n# Basic one-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Optional: preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Propylene Glycol|50%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n5. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nPreservative is optional because the formula has a lot of humectant (Propylene Glycol) that binds water and also low pH.\n\nUsed much more PG as required because no other co-solvents or buffering agents used, so higher amount is required to maintain the stability and prevent recrystallization of SA.\n\n# Basic two-solvent serum\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Ethanol|20%|\n|Propylene Glycol|20%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Add the preservative of choice and stir until dissolved;\n5. Adjust pH to 3.5 with Lactic or Citric acid (to go down) or Sodium Hydroxide (to go up);\n6. Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nMix of 2 solvents allow to add less of it (40% total comparing to 50% of PG in previous formula). Also, Ethanol makes the serum less oily.\n\n# Advanced serum with surfactant and buffering agent\n\n|Ingredient|Content|\n|:-|:-|\n|Water|up to 100%|\n|Preservative|q.s.|\n|Xanthan Gum|0.3%|\n|Sodium Citrate|0.5%|\n|Polysorbate 80|5%|\n|Propylene Glycol|30%|\n|Salicylic Acid|2%|\n|Sodium Hydroxide (10% solution)|4.46|\n\nPreparation:\n\n1.

Sprinkle Xanthan Gum and leave overnight to gel.\n\nThis formula utilizes all the formulation suggestions I gathered from different sources. It has several glycols and Ethanol as a mix of solvents, uses surfactant and Betaine plus buffer with Sodium Lactate.\n\n# Formulas from YouTube bloggers\n\nExample of good formulas:\n\n1.

[TaraLee: DIY Paulas Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant](https://youtu.be/LIubTz7QIW8) \\- too little of solvents, too high pH (because lower pH will lead to more free acid and recrystallization due to lack of solvents).\n4. [Cosmateur: DIY Salicylic Acid 2% Serum | 4 ingredients](https://youtu.be/RFBUwxkrkaU) \\- although the amount of solvents seems right, the formula is written in volumes, which means SA content is higher than 2% allowed (ethanol is lighter than water). Also, part of the ethanol evaporates during extensive mixing, so the concentration gets even higher. Moreover, the pH is not adjusted at all.\n\n# Community formulas\n\n* [Cleansing pads](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/vywxmu/super_simple_salicylic_acid_cleansing_pads/)\n* [Paula's Choice dupe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYBeauty/comments/jav3qq/i_made_a_2_salicylic_acid_toner_loosely_based_on/)",

        "body": "A great comprehensive view! I have a few comments/corrections/additions. Feel free to disregard them :)\n\n>Under normal conditions the solubility is 291.3 g/L or 369.2 g/kg, which means 36.92g of Salicylic Acid can be dissolved in 100g of pure Ethanol.\n\nI would add \"**g/kg ethanol**\", otherwise this can be confused with g/kg solution (which is the more common use of the unit). \n\n>2. Formulate at pH 3.5 to meet FDA requirements for skincare products. Under this pH if you add 2% of Salicylic Acid only 0.46% will be in free form (and hence less solvents needed)\n\nAs you decrease pH, more acid will be in the free-acid form (that is, protonated). However, above pH 3.5, you'll reduce the amount of free acid (increase the ionized form). It should be updated to read \"**Above** this pH, if you add...\".\n\n>4. Include some mild surfactants (Polysorbate 20, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate etc) to decrease surface tension and boost the solubility;\n\nI don't see that the article comments on the mechanism of solubilization. However, the likely mechanism would be somewhere between incorporation into the micelles and encapsulation. Surfactants decreasing air-water interfacial surface tension is an intrinsic property of surfactants, and doesn't really pertain to boosting solubility. It's a nit-picky suggestion, but it's just because I work with surfactants.\n\n>[Dermarium \"Tricky Duet 2% Salicylic Acid\" toner](https://incidecoder.com/products/dermarium-tricky-duet-2-salicylic-acid-2):\n\n>INCI: Water,¬†**Ethanol**,¬†*Salicylic Acid*,¬†**Propylene Glycol**,¬†**Betaine**,¬†**Sodium Lactate**, Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil, Ethylhexylglycerin, Triethanolamine, Phenoxyethanol,¬†**Polysorbate 20**,¬†**PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, O-Cymen-5-Ol, Menthol, Methyl Lactate.\n\n>1.

However, triethanolamine is a pH adjuster, and will form a small amount of triethanolammonium salicylate (which does increase solubility, albeit by neutralization). \n\n  \nAll in all, a lot of great, helpful information!

I am a bit scared to use this,not gona lie, because of all the heavy ingredients, but winters tend to get very dry where my hostel is, hence I am going to go out on a limb and try this out. \n\n2. UV doux sunscreen-pretty self explanatory. This is one of the most raved about sunscreens right now. I am trying to hate pan my Lotus gloop (the damn thing refuses to finish wtf dude)\n\n3. Dermafique toner- i have checked out the ingredient list and it seems interesting (Aqua, Peg-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Glycerin, Panthenol, Allantoin, Pullulan, Decyl Glucoside, Sorbitol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycolic Acid, Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract, Xanthan Gum, Lecithin, Phenoxyethanol, Polysorbate-20, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Pca, Bht, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tocopherol, Propylene Glycol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Dmdm Hydantoin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene, Fragrance, Ci 74260). \n\nI am not big on toners, but seeing panthenol so high up on the ingredient list made me so happy. \n\n4. Aveeno dermexa emollient cream- although I have one body butter and a body lotion to finish up, I still want to go for this lotion solely for my hands and feet. My knuckles tend to get very dry(and sometimes bleed) during extreme dry winters and this looks like could help. \n\n5. Baidyanath/dabur almond oil- i always buy a bottle of almond oil before the winter begins. It is an amazing all purpose product. \n\n6. Sebamed foaming face wash- i am currently using cetaphil. I want to try out something else. No specific reason for choosing sebamed out of everything else. I am not fussy about facial cleansers. \n\n7. Fabindia charcoal face mask- I have used this one before and this cleared up my skin like no other. Fabindia's products are incredibly underrated. This is one Indian homegrown brand that I can fully get behind. I have used quite a few of their stuff and none disappointed me. \n\n8. Neutrogena lip balm with SPF15- no specific reason for choosing this one out of all. Just wanted to try out a lip balm with spf. \n\n9. Any one of nykaa's moi perfumes- I simply love perfumes. i have the one in black(can't remember the name). I want to try out more of their perfume line.

    "body": "Just a small review on a new little happy hitter in my pile! A few months ago I was buying some cream on iHerb and needed something to fill space for free shipping. At the time Coxir was on sale so I got it for $12.16. It had snail and that was enough to be a target. I kind of considered the brand to be a Cosrx knockoff, which it very well may be, or just have super similar packaging. But I absolutely did not take the purchase seriously and it sat on my shelf for a while. \n\nAbout a month ago I opened it and gave it a try. I‚Äôve used it on and off since then, never quite committing until recently. Here‚Äôs what changed and what I think about the product!\n\nWhat changed: on a lark I decided to smear half my face with Coxir and the other half with Missha‚Äôs Misa Cho Gong Jin Toner (bigger review for later). I was shocked by how the Coxir immediately dimmed the redness on its side. It was very visible. It soaked in and bam: calmer skin. I have mild rosacea so calm skin is my battle. Calm skin in summer is like a war. \n\nUsing it more and for me, it‚Äôs just a really nice product. It‚Äôs thin but thickened enough that it‚Äôs not so watery it flows off your hand immediately. You can easily layer it. It doesn‚Äôt feel heavy on my skin; it‚Äôs barely noticeable. I really enjoy the scent which is very powder fresh to my nose. It‚Äôs just a nice simple easy to layer non-offensive toner (for me). I didn‚Äôt even look at the ingredients until now but they‚Äôre nice: (and kudos to Coxir for having them easily available on their website)\n\nSnail Secretion Filtrate, Water, Betula Alba Juice, Butylene glycol, Methyl Gluceth-20, Sodium Hyaluronate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycoproteins, Betaine, Glycerin, Yeast Extract, Viola Mandshurica Flower Extract, Morus Alba Fruit Extract, Sea Water, Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Black Soybean Extract, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Extract, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Extract, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract, Panax Ginseng Berry Extract, Adenosine, Copper Tripeptide-1, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Parfum\n\nA lot of stuff I quite like and gravitate to normally. Because of this I‚Äôm going to be checking out some of their other stuff in the future. The Black Snail Collagen line has a few products and this has been more visibly valuable than several centella focused products I‚Äôve used over my AB journey.",

My feet really like it in particular and as someone else mentions, it is nice after shaving too. It also makes a good hair gel for flyaways. Use the tiniest dab, don't goop it on.

None of these products were sponsored ~ I purchased them myself.   I do have affiliate and referral links but disclose in my blogs  &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n [Cleansing Review](\nhttps://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/more-cleanser-reviews-cosrx-primary-raw-the-face-shop-doyouganic-cleansing-soap-plus-ciracle-revisited/)   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  \n\n\n\n\nI did four cleansers in here ~ all with really LONG names:  The Face Shop Calming Seed Bubble Foam Cleanser, Primary Raw doyouganic cleanser soap, cosRX Low pH Good Morning Gel cleanser and a revisit with Ciracle Anti-Blemish Tea Tree Wash.  I also did a quick,unscientific comparison between cosRX & Ciracle as they are made by the same \"company\" - cosRX is the parent of Ciracle.  Lots of pictures plus how they performed    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n\n\n\n[Makeup cosRX Make Me Lovely Cream & A'Pieu Doramon EyeShadow Palette #1 My Daily](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/instareview-cosrx-make-me-lovely-cream-apieu-doraemon-palette/)  \n\nswatches and all!    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I've been reading here about requests on where to get unusual masks and hard to find masks ~ I subscribe to MaskGenie since day 1 (janaury of this year) and I have been so happy with this subscription service.  She ships directly from Hong Kong. I am not affiliated with her, nor do I make any money from mentioning her service.  These are unboxings, which means that I just give information about the masks, ingredients, and I might try one or two of them by the time I do the unboxing - if I do, then I mention the scent, texture, how it worked..\n\n\n* [October's MaskGenie Unboxing](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/2015/10/28/unboxing-october-2015-maskgenie/)\n\n* [See all of my MaskGenie Unboxings here](https://beautyfindsforme.wordpress.com/category/monthly-boxes/maskgenie-monthly-boxes/)     \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \nAnd finally ~ I will be reviewing this product more in depth on my blog by mid november, along with Innisfree Green Tea & Mint Hair Scaler and La‚Äôdor Perfect Hair Filler, but when I asked about this initially, there was interest in this product right away.  So, I will give you a quick rundown on Holika Holika Hair Rinsing \nVinegar From Nature  in Camellia    \n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIngredients: Purified water, ethanol, vinegar, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, glycerin, Octyldodeceth-16, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Butylene Glycol, Cetrimonium Chloride, magnesium nitrate, magnesium chloride, Cyclohexasiloxane, silk amino acids, Ethylhexylglycerin, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, sodium benzoate , fragrance   \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n \n\n \nI can assure you that this does not smell like vinegar at ALL!!  It smells like camellia flowers and it is not overpowering at all.  At first, when looking at the ingredient list, I thought this would be a conditioner, despite the name rinse.  However, it is a rinse ~ it is a watery product and I even put a spray pump on it, as I didn't want to waste it by pouring it into my hand (it is just like water).   I have to use a conditioner, this is not in replacement of one.  I use this product after I use a conditioner and this would be a detox product for my hair to remove build up and also bring shine back into my hair.  I don't think this would be a daily routine item for me, but every few days.   \n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThis is just an initial impression and hopefully, I will have more by mid November. \n\n",

I slather it in my hands and then rub it on my damp face. In mx this is $88mxn-$108mxn (4.5 - 5.5 euro).\n\n[lasts a long time! I first purchased it in november and i still have and i use it daily in the mornings. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9vrp4jehxqa1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=387eb3c9c1b9118e522aa8d728ebe18f983dc1e2)\n\nTo target trouble areas, this is specifically for my seb dermatitis, my derm recommended me: **keroseb emulsion,** I'm pretty sure the brand is spanish HD cosmetic efficiency I think its called, this product was a bit more \"expensive\" but it lasts a long time, I purchased it in November and I think I still have a lot, it's a pump bottle so I don't know how much. It is heavily fragranced which confuses me given its for such sensitive skins, but I haven't had an issue (and fragranced tends to be an issue for me). I apply it after I cleanse on my trouble areas which for me are the sides of my nose and eyebrows and forehead. The ingredients are \\*Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Glycerin, Squalane, Cyclo- pentasiloxane, Pentylene Glycol, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Dimethicone, Piroctone Olamine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Biosaccharide Gum-2, Papain, Zinc Sulfate, Sodium Polyac- rylate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Proline, Alanine, Maltodextrin, Parfum (Fragrance), Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexylglycerin, Calcium Pantothenate, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Urea, Magnesium Lactate, Disodium EDTA, Potassium Lactate, Magnesium Chloride, Serine, Sodium Citrate.\\*Is not completely fungal acne safe, but I find that it really soothes my skin if I'm having a flareup, if my skin is compromised in those areas this product will sting a little, and itch a tiny bit (nothing like finacea gel) as it is absorbed into the skin, but by the end of that same day is so much better! A little goes a long way, texture is like a gel cream, I don't find that it pills, and it doesn't flare my perioral dermatitis either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kly322wv04ra1.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=312c2610e7c4a186e4e0988ba58b258c90063992\n\nFor the body: **Lactovit** another spanish brand, this is super cheap for me they have a cream that has a 10% complex of urea, lactic acid and retinol. It always kinda seems that the packaging comes half empty, but the package is just bigger, it's like 10 usd for 400ml, I use this for the body. It absorbs fast, it has fragrance but it smells nice to me, kind of powdery. They have a shower cleanser too which I use that really helps with ingrown hairs and KP.\n\n[version for the mex market](https://preview.redd.it/m80yerhqhxqa1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8e228928a277467cbc0243e88294c486cd0489)\n\nTo protect: for spf I use the **Cetaphil liposomal lotion** which in the EU is the exact same as the Daylong Protect and Care spf 50+ (or Daylong extreme spf), I find this to be an excellent primer for makeup, it doesn't pill, it doesn't break me out, it doesn't have fragrance, it feels like it lasts all day, and also calms my skin.\n\nThat's it. For facial moisturizer I use a small American brand named Malezia, I absolutely swear by them but the shipping price can be hefty in international orders and so not sharing them here.\n\n\\*\\*I find several products of this routine to be quite affordable given the price they have in the Mexican market, I hope that's the same case for EU.\\*\\*  \nxx  \nedit: to add the correct lactovit cream  \nedit2: to remove the malezia link the only american brand i mentioned because it gave the main image to the post and seemed misleading.

    "body": "While searching around for truly natural skincare products, I was amazed at how many products mislabel themselves as \"natural\" and/or \"clean\", only to look at the ingredients and realize it is not so.  Also, these are not cheap products.  One example is the **Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Toner by Fresh - $45 at Sephora.** The packaging is beautiful and with a brand name Fresh, you would assume that it is natural especially as Sephora marks it with their \"Clean at Sephora\" symbol which means \"**Clean at Sephora is formulated without a list of over 50 ingredients, including sulfates (SLS and SLES), parabens, phthalates, and more. For the full list, check out the Ingredients tab.\"**\n\nSounds good right?  Yes, compared to other brands which do contain these but when you look at the full ingredient list on this toner product, there are still some to be cautious of:\n\nWater, Glycerin, **Butylene Glycol**, Rosa Centifolia Flower, Rosa Damascena Flower Water, Rosa Multiflora Fruit Extract, Angelica Keiskei Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, **PEG-150**, **PPG-26-Buteth-26**, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Citrate, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, **BHT,** **Parfum** (Fragrance), **Phenoxyethanol**, Citronellol, Geraniol.\n\n*Butylene Glycol*  \\-  skin, lung and eye irritant; environmental toxin\n\n*Sodium hyaluronate* \\- naturally occurring but found in connective tissues such as cartilage, so if you are looking for a vegan product, this would be out!\n\n*PEG-150 -* polyethylene glycols are often contaminated with 1,4-Dioxane; suspected endocrine disruptor; linked to cancer in animals; skin and eye irritant.\n\n*PPG-26-Buteth-26 -* not much information on this one but another synthetic product I would rather not put on my skin, esp my face\n\n*PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil -* Pure castor oil is readily available, so why go for one that could be contaminated with toxins?\n\n*BHT* \\- synthetic preservative\n\n**Parfum** \\- this is actually the most concerning ingredient because not many people realize that the single word Parfum (or fragrance), is a mixture of synthetic chemicals (any combination of over 3000 chemicals used in the skincare industry to denote fragrance).  Of these chemicals, several are highly toxic.  Only choose a product that uses pure essential oils as additives, if you are truly looking for something natural.\n\n**Phenoxyethanol**¬†\\- a synthetic preservative found in almost all skincare products that is an endocrine disruptor and carcinogen in animals\n\nIf you do a quick search online, you can find several diy formulations for skincare care toners that use very simple ingredients such as rose water, glycerin, pure aloe vera, and pure skin oils.  \n\nHope this helps others who scrutinize labels like I do!",

It's very misleading.\n\nSephora's clean at sephora is made to avoid ingredients that could majorly cause irritation and which studies have proven to be wrong. All the ingredients mentioned are used within guidelines and the guidelines are usually more strict than required. Phenoxyethanol's endocrine disrupting abilities are so small, especially in the usage rates used to cosmetics. Even if you use several products with it, it is unlikely to cause an issue.\n\nIn preservatives, I actually prefer parabens which are the most widely researched and safest preservatives in cosmetics. And before you tell me they can cause cancer, please do your research. They do not cause cancer and the one paraben that they 'thought could cause cancer in the horribly done study that everyone cites was taken off the market ages ago.\n\nAlso, methylparaben naturally occurs in blueberries. It's just mass produced synthetically. There are also numerous natural ingredients that can cause irritation and cancer. \n\nas someone who use to be very big on natural skin care, I really hope you do some more research and read more scientific studies. I still love natural skincare, but there is so much misinformation it's scary. People with fungal acne can't use a lot of natural ingredients and ingredients like dimethicone, mct oil (caprylyl/capryl triglycerides) and mineral oil help them greatly.\n\nWhat is natural has very different meanings to different people. There is not a strict guideline. Minimal processing vs more processing? That's probably why sephora's guidelines are the way it is.",

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

Contains kaolin and petrolatum. Vegan.\n\n**Appearance:** Ivory color, thick, solid, matte in the jar below the top layer, contains a few tiny dark flecks throughout.\n\n**Fragrance:** This product comes in five different scents. They are (per Flagship's online store):\n\n* Orchid and Orange Blossom - neroli, bergamot, orchid, jasmine on a base of vetiver, patchouli and musk tallow. Fresh and light. Fragrance oil based.\n* Neroli black pepper - slightly spicy, fresh, and complex. Essential oil based.\n* Sandalwood Elite - coriander, cinnamon, sandalwood, juniper berry, rosemary, lavender, orange ginger, tonka bean, vanilla. Fragrance oil based.\n* Strawberry Mango - self explanatory, but doesn't say whether fragrance or essential oils are used to create it.\n* Viking - the one I have. Fragrance oil based. FS says it's \"spicy, peppery, and citrus. Great smell for all year round.\" To me it smells like Mysore Sandal Soap (which is my all-time favorite soap) but slightly more musky and complex. So I can definitely pick up a sandalwood note in it. My nose can't detect the citrus though. In the hair it's woodsy, a little spicy and floral, and an overall light, fresh scent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scoop:** Using my usual \"scrape with the back of my fingernail\" method, the product comes out of the jar easily. It's pretty solid but not as hard as American Gardens or Anarchist. It separates from the main mass of product in layers, sort of like shale.\n\n**Emulsification:** Takes effort to break down. Gets sticky and tacky immediately, with a few little hard bits that take a bit of elbow grease to disintegrate. The instructions on the jar suggest taking a dime-size scoop at a time, but I'd recommend taking less at a time and just layering it in.\n\n**Application:** In damp hair, applies smoothly with minimal tug and pull. Putting it in dry does have resistance but still not much tugging. Anything beyond three small scoops seems to oversaturate my hair, leaving a significant amount of product behind on my hands which is very sticky and needs washed off with soap.\n\n**Styles:**\n\n* Pompadour - With a name like \"Heavy Clay\", I wasn't expecting the best performance in terms of volume. It did give me more volume than I expected it to, and made my hair very responsive to styling. Great control. Got some nice \"comb lines\" in the front. Started out with 2 scoops and added a third around hour three. [https://imgur.com/a/46Qrpwd](https://imgur.com/a/46Qrpwd)\n* Side part - Works very well. 2 scoops gives nice texture accentuated with finger combing, however, beware of a dirty/greasy look the next day. With fingers: [https://imgur.com/a/gIq1ea9](https://imgur.com/a/gIq1ea9) With comb: [https://imgur.com/a/GEKRiU9](https://imgur.com/a/GEKRiU9)\n* Slickback - Also excels here. I decided to forgo the blowdryer and got really nice results with 3 scoops + airdrying. Comb lines are prominent and the unruly bits on the side are laying down like they should. [https://imgur.com/a/Zn8SUXc](https://imgur.com/a/Zn8SUXc)\n\n**Results:**\n\n* 1 hour - Shape and volume holding up well, but around hour 3 I felt a couple locks of hair fall down onto my forehead. I added a third scoop into my hair, which seemed to do the trick.\n* 8 hours - The style is deflating and looking a little raggedy, but nothing a quick hit with my dollar-store round brush can't fix. Scent is still pretty strong. [https://imgur.com/a/jTDWDFF](https://imgur.com/a/jTDWDFF)\n* 24 hours - Had to wet the back to get it to lay back down, and used blowdryer and my round brush to get the front neat again (especially on the right side). Looks very presentable. Can still smell it. [https://imgur.com/a/c5AL10L](https://imgur.com/a/c5AL10L)\n\n**Pairs well with:** N/A \\[will update if I find one later that works well\\]\n\n**Washout:** Washes off the hands with soap. I needed to shampoo twice to get it all out of my hair.\n\n**Final rating and thoughts: 8.5/10.** This is a versatile, high-quality heavy clay which has a learning curve to it and, once it's in the hair, performs similarly to American Gardens but scoops much easier and has a more lustrous finish to it. I don't think that I'm the target audience for heavy clays with my fine, straight hair, but the fact that I could figure out a way to use this one and it performed well for me is the mark of a well-formulated, well-thought-out product. Big props to Flagship on this one. Overall, one of the better products I've used. Has a low shine, which is exactly what it says on the jar. A strong hold... not so much, for me anyway. If we're using the scale light-medium-firm-strong, I'd peg it as a med-firm (2 scoops) to firm (3 scoops). Has a waxy feel, but not excessively greasy or sticky. Would highly recommend to someone with thick hair or stubborn waves/curls. Would also recommend for fine-haired people who want to try a less dry clay product. Smell is amazing and lasts a long time; I definitely will be ordering this product again just so I can try the Strawberry Mango (I'm a real sucker for fruity scents). I'm also very excited to try the Dead Sea Clay by Flagship from their handmade line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout me/background: 30s F of northern/eastern European background with type 1A fine, straight hair which I color with henna. I've suffered from TTM for the past 10 years so my hair is also rather thin... this has gotten better since I've started putting product in daily, as I can't run my fingers along the strands as easily as before. I prefer low shine to matte products, of which clays are a favorite. My pre-styling and washout routine for all products is a wash and condition with either Bearsville shampoo bar or Suave non-clarifying shampoo, and Herbal Essences conditioner. I apply most products before blowdrying, with a few exceptions. My styling tools consist of a cheap round brush, a rattail comb, and two sizes of Conair pick comb. All products reviewed are used by themselves (meaning no hairspray, mousse, etc.) unless specified. \n\nRating scale: 0-3.9 Bad, 4-5.9 OK, 6-7.9 Good, 8+ Excellent",

    "body": "After I found this sub, I had the idea to do in-depth written reviews on the products I own, as I don't do the video format. I'm aiming to get at least one of these out per week. I thought it was fitting to do my first review on the product that began my love affair with hair styling aids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brand**: Anarchist Soap Co.\n\n**Product name**: Matte Pomade\n\n**Made in**: Simi Valley, CA, USA\n\n**Container size(s)**: 4 oz glass jar\n\n**Price**: $24.99\n\n**Unit price**: $6.25/oz\n\n**Product type, hold, finish**: Clay pomade, firm hold, true matte finish.\n\n**Top 5 ingredients/other formulation notes**: Distilled water, rice bran wax, kaolin, beeswax, hydrogenated castor oil. Also contains avocado and coconut oils and bentonite further down the list. Final ingredient is \"love\". How sweet.\n\n**Appearance**: Off-white to tan, opaque, solid\n\n**Fragrance**: Anarchist has made this product in at least 5 scents, of which I own 3. They are:\n\n* Outlaw - whiskey, tobacco, leather, gunpowder. Very rich, musky, slightly sweet.\n* Viking - evergreen forest, mahogany, leather, amber, metal. Woody, a little herbaceous and musky, with a detectable metallic note.\n* Heretic - hickory, suede, patchouli. Hickory is definitely the dominant note in this one. Think drumsticks or an Amish-made hickory table. Light and woody.\n\nThe ones I don't have are Mobster (patchouli, orange peel, mandarin, coriander, star anise, tonka) and Arsonist (fire, embers, smoke, metal, sandalwood, the dark arts).\n\nAll that I've tried have been amazing, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be Outlaw. They are all strong in the jar and in the hair, and last all day. This product may not be the best choice for those sensitive to smells, or those who wear a cologne or perfume as the scents may clash.\n\n**Scoop**: Very firm. And I mean very. I have to push with the back of my fingernail to get it out of the jar.\n\n**Emulsification**: Takes a little more effort than others I've tried to break down. Tacky feel in the hands. I do one very small (pea-sized) scoop at a time to make breakdown easier.\n\n**Application**: This product is best used in damp hair, or else it will be near-impossible to spread evenly and will yank your hair out. I normally use two small scoops. The first goes in okay, but on the second there is a bit of tugging. I tend to lose a couple hairs but it's not too bad considering my very fine hair type. A brush or comb goes through easily to ensure it is evenly distributed.\n\n**Styles**:\n\n* Pompadour - Works very well for this. Two small scoops give my fine, thin hair incredible volume -- almost too much! See photos: [https://imgur.com/a/GMRzxaN](https://imgur.com/a/GMRzxaN)\n* Textured side part - Also works nicely. The strong hold keeps my fringe back and off my forehead. Can get a nice messy texture without it looking greasy and gross.\n* Slickback - Too matte of a finish for this style, in my opinion. I feel other products with a natural to low shine would look better, but hold-wise it would definitely work\n\n**Results**:\n\n* 1 hour - Looks exactly the same as when I first styled. Can feel the product in my hair, but no excessive dryness, greasiness, or waxiness. Doesn't have the grittiness that I've felt with some other clays.\n* 6 hours - Still going strong. Barely any volume deflation. Was listening to some Kreator and the shape mostly held despite some vigorous head motions. A quick hit with the pick got it back into place. [https://imgur.com/a/GxXvByM](https://imgur.com/a/GxXvByM)\n* 16 hours (next morning) - Slept with it in and was able to use just a round brush to get it back to where it was last night. No water or blow dryer required, except for a bit in the back that was sticking up due to how I slept. Still no greasiness -- which is impressive considering I've always had issues with my hair getting greasy fast.\n* 24 hours - Took a walk to the store in the wind and rain, came back in, brushed it, and it looks as good as when I first did it. The clays are doing a great job keeping the grease at bay. [https://imgur.com/a/pfUzVb7](https://imgur.com/a/pfUzVb7)\n\n**Pairs well with**: Smoothing serum, if you're prone to flyaways.\n\n**Washout**: Rinses off hands with cool water and completely out of the hair with one wash with a basic shampoo.\n\n**Final rating and thoughts**: **9/10**. This was the first clay pomade and homebrew product I've ever used, and I feel like it has spoiled me. It's what started my obsession with high-quality hair products. Honestly the only things keeping it from a perfect score are the difficult scoop, the price, and the spotty availability for the scents (as of the time of this writing, only Outlaw and Viking are in stock). The finish is truly matte, the volume it provides my fine and thinning hair is phenomenal, and the hold is quite good while still being pliable and receptive to combing/brushing. I highly recommend to anyone who likes matte styling products.\n\n**ETA**: Link to product: [https://www.etsy.com/listing/776425676/the-outlaw-matte-pomade?click\\_key=97181f2f228321925204c6679c39f7c97ebe28da%3A776425676&click\\_sum=c4689c91&ref=shop\\_home\\_active\\_2&crt=1](https://www.etsy.com/listing/776425676/the-outlaw-matte-pomade?click_key=97181f2f228321925204c6679c39f7c97ebe28da%3A776425676&click_sum=c4689c91&ref=shop_home_active_2&crt=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout me/background: 30s F of northern/eastern European background with type 1A fine, straight hair which I color with henna.

The ingredients are: Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(146,340mg), Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Dipropylene Glycol, Trehalose, Panthenol, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Sorghum Bicolor Stalk Juice, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance\n\nIs this price discrepancy due to marketing?

        "body": "because you're comparing fresh, a higher-end brand, to atrue, a more mid-tier brand. if sulwhasoo released a $65 black tea treatment essence, we wouldn't be having this conversation. but because a cheaper brand happened to release something like fresh, we draw a comparison, but since the brands aren't even on the same price point level within their respective markets, the comparison falls short from a money perspective.\n\nit just so happens that even cheaper korean brands like innisfree, nature republic, etc. happen to release products that are on par with the products released by higher-end western brands. in korean beauty, every brand is focused on having all of these fancy skincare products, whereas in western beauty, only higher end brands do that, while more affordable brands tend to stick with the basics. if cetaphil or cerave were releasing fermented essences or super complex-seeming miracle creams, it wouldn't seem like korean skincare is cheaper at all, but since drugstore brands tend to stick with the more basic niche, we start comparing cheap korean brands to luxury western brands.\n\nso basically, korean beauty isn't necessarily cheaper; korean brands as a whole are all going crazy with skincare, while in the west, only luxury brands tend to use these \"fancy\" ingredients and have these fancy claims. i guess it boils down to mindset. in the west, fancy skincare is a luxury, so brands only feel like it's worth delving into that realm if they know they're going to sell it for an expensive price (which is why you don't see cetaphil releasing an at-home 30% AHA facial with trendy pink packaging). if you want something cheap, you go with the basics. meanwhile, in korea, fancy skincare is kind of a standard i guess, so brands are all releasing products that fill the same niche, regardless of their price points.",

I have quite a bit of products that help with that and they do help don't get me wrong, but this baby? Whew~! It adds quite a glow to the skin regardless of how I use it. When I do use it as a mask or sleeping pack I do wake up with a bit more hydration than just slapping it on, but that is expected. As I stated, I've been using this since November and I've barely scratched the surface! Luckily I have 12 months to use this! I've soaked cottons in this and given them to my mom (she has super dull skin) and now she expects them every time I visit -.-\n\nI can't say much on anti-aging as I don't have really fine lines or wrinkles yet (YET), but I can say it definitely hydrates and brightens the skin. It definitely helps when I'm in such a rush to get out the door but don't want to leave my skin dry all day~! \n\nI also put mine in the fridge as I've mentioned and man oh man does it help to not only add a glow to my face but the cooling helps waken my tired eyes up!\n\n**Pros:**\n\nHydrates\n\nBrightens skin\n\nCan be used in quite a few ways\n\nTONS of product\n\nNo heavy scent\n\nFeels light on skin\n\n**Cons:**\n\n$40 could be a bit pricey to some\n\nOnly the ingredients are in English",

After awhile, it toddled it's way to the back burner of my mind. \n\nAfter reading your review, I've gone back to lusting after it. I mean, look at it, it's all cute and looks like actual honey in a jar. It's definitely going on my shopping list and will be hauled sometime in the future.

I started avoiding sun, and wearing the spf lip balm whenever exposed to sun and for the night I‚Äôd put on the vit A ointment which would first help a bit, but not much anymore. I stopped using the lip peeling as it was only making things worse. i drink a lot of water, have a balanced diet, take vit D daily.

Next to cleansing, this cream was basically our only skincare product and has been a holy grail for both of us (dry skin, but fairly smooth and calm).

Same problem.\n\nTurns out the formula of the newer tins are totally different than the old ones (see pics and ingredient list down below). Notice the newer formula list is almost twice as long. It went from a nostalgic powdery scent to a disgusting, rancid coconut-like smell which we just can't ignore. Unfortunately, our Nivea era might have just come to an end.

    "body": "*I started to talk about Sandalore in another post, but now that the information harvested is growing in number, I will organize my research here. Sandalore is still* ***not approved*** *for hair loss therapy, so I'm just speculating here. Please be responsible and don't take any stupid risk.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we know is that **Sandalore** **prolongs human hair growth** ex vivo **increasing production of the anagen-prolonging growth factor**. What we all **hope** is that it can be used as a hair loss therapy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sandalwood** and his derived products **have no similar effect to Sandalore**, Sandalore **is not** present in Sandalwood. So **no**, you **can NOT just rub your head with Sandalwood oil.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe tested safe quantity of Sandalore is **0.10518 gr** **~~in 1 l of solution~~** with **0.1% DMSO** as vehicle (500‚ÄâŒºM).\n\nA **high dose** (presumably 1000x, 500mM) of Sandalore **should inhibit** both **hair growth** and intrafollicularIGF-1 production, so **be precise and do the math**.\n\nThe Sandalore is **insoluble in water**: putting it in an already prepared water-alcohol solution (like liquid Rogain) risk to produce a **precipitate**, making it ineffective. The correct procedure is to first dissolve S. into the 100% solvent, then dilute the stock solution into the water.\n\nSince DMSO is a **\"universal\" solvent**, it's very important to operate in **the most aseptic environment as possible**: water should be \"pure\" and medically approved and **plastics** such as PVC, PS and polycarbonate **shouldn't be used** to contain the final solution.\n\nBefore each application, **it is very important to wash your head/hair** and leave no residual product (es. shampoo, soap) on your skin. Don't forget to wash and dry your hands too.\n\nDMSO half-life is 14 hours, so **1 application per day of 1-2 ml** of the final solution should be enough.\n\nWhen we say 0.1% of DMSO we are talking about 1.1 mg of DMSO per litre of the final solution. It's **not safe to use more than 5mg per litre** for this experiment. Again, **be precise and do the math**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause of the **natural hair's cycle of life**, **it's rather unlikely to see a miraculous result in a couple of days** of application. In in-vivo human trials, **3 months of treatment** are required to achieve a noticeable effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy expectation is that, since S. promote anagen and delay catagen phases, it should have a very similar effect to Minoxidil. Furthermore, because of that, S. can't prevent the DHT binding to the androgen receptors of the hair follicle.\n\n**52.59 mg of Sandalore, 1 g of DMSO and** **~~499 ml of water~~** **should be enough for 8 months** for a total cost of circa 8.30‚Ç¨, but it will require an initial investment of 92 ‚Ç¨ (for me in Europe)!!! **It's too expensive ATM for me** to start the experiment.\n\nRight now I'm looking for a substitute of DMSO that can be used as vehicle for topical usage of Sandalore.\n\nAny suggestion is well accepted, but try to keep the comments **as much scientific as possible**, thanks.\n\n**New idea**: we can even use a **syringe** to measure liquids. Those for **insulin injection** have a precision of 0.1 ml. Of course one should first properly convert the g in ml, only water has gram = milligram. This will make the experiment cheaper! **;)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:**\n\nFirst of all, we should keep in mind that five of the eight people who wrote the scientific paper we are talking about worked (in a research institute) for the company depositary of the patent for the anti-hairloss lotion with Sandalore.\n\nI'm not suggesting anything, just draw your own conclusions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis patent is important because it tells us that:\n\n1. Sandalore is used \"in a quantity between **0.1 and 10%** by weight (w/w %)\";\n2. Ethanol can be used in a quantity between **15% and 35%** by weight;\n3. The ethanol can be in the form of denatured alcohol (~~rubbing alcohol~~);\n4. A small amount of castor oil (0.5 - 3%) can be used too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNumber 1) is **very important** because using 0.1058 gr in 1 litre of water it's actually a quantity of 0.01% by weight. Even in the experiment in which Sandalore was used as an accelerant of wound healing, they tested 500 ŒºM of it but then they reported a final pharmaceutical formulation with a concentration from about 0.1 to about 0.5% by weight.\n\nMaybe my math has some errors, maybe there is a multiplicative factor because the skin could waste/block/use part of the Sandalore absorbed, BUT now we can say that we should use 0.1058gr of Sandalore, 0.11g of DMSO and 99.78482gr of distilled water that is equal to say\n\n**0.11739ml of Sandalore,0.1ml of DMSO,99.9942ml of d.water.**\n\nIf we want to use ethanol instead, we should use:\n\n0.10581g of Sandalore (**0.11739ml**),15g of Ethanol (**19.1ml**) (~~no way I'm going to use rubbing alcohol on my head, but it could be a good shampoo for hobo bald men~~ actually there is a form of denatured alcohol that is used by the perfume industry), water to **100 ml**.\n\nIf you plan to add the castor oil, be sure it's hydrogenated castor oil.\n\nUse a small syringe like those for insulin injection with a precision of 0.1 or 0.01 ml like [this](https://withdrawal.theinnercompass.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/Step18_350px_image3_400px_figurethree.jpg) so it will be easier to dose the ingredients.\n\nPut first the Sandalore into the DMSO or ethanol ([Read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/9rbf7b/sandalore_a_scientific_homemade_approch/eap2g3a/)), then this stock solution into the water. Shake it before every application, 1 or 2 ml should cover the scalp. The first time, apply it on your wrist and wait 1 hour to see if you have any bad reaction; if everything it's ok, let's take your own responsibility and apply it on your head once per day if you know what you are doing. Maybe after a couple of weeks, we can even try to apply it twice per day.\n\nGood luck (I don't think it will work, **Sandalore has been used in anti-dandruff and anti-itch lotions since 2003**, this means they made some test on hairs for sure, how they didn't notice it could regrow hairs? :D )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update 2**\n\nI bought 50g (too much, I know, my bad) of Sandalore from [PellWall](https://pellwall.com/product/sandalore/). The nice thing is it came with a free sample ( \\~ 5ml) of Sandalore at 10% of ethanol. The scent is not that bad as someone says and it's not strong at all but it's very persistent. ~~Maybe it's not so \"manly\"~~ It's not manly at all, but it will not be a problem to walk around wearing it. So many shampoo or shower gel smells like it, just like a classic ~~Badedas~~ Milf.\n\nI will update you when I will have my solvent too.\n\nAnyway, it's \"**approach**\", not ~~approch~~.\n\n**Update 3**I have prepared a solution with 1% of Sandalore and 20% of ethanol. Left it for 48h, shacked it a couple of time every day and then I added water. As soon as I added water, the solution turned white, milky. This is normal because sandalore is water insoluble but at least it didn't precipitate or separate. After 24h of rest, it was still milky. However, I will shake it before every application. It doesn't burn at all, it didn't give me any rash or flake like minoxidil, no strong smell. Yes, it evaporates very soon, maybe a hydrogenated oil or glycol should be added, but for this month I will keep using this solution.\n\nThe \"it works\" effect after a couple of days is given by the alcohol who clean and dry hairs, making them more \"visible\". The same thing happens with minoxidil, but it's not a miracle. Just bristly tiny hair.",

Fortunately, the ingredients are right on the package, so I'll list them here--there are a couple of red flags for the super-sensitive, but again, $3.33 for a box of ten at RRS!!!!!\n\nIngredients: Water, glycerin, butylene glycol, alcohol, xantham gum, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, sodium hyaluronate, panax ginseng root extract, panthenol, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, sodium citrate, disodium EDTA, allantoin, hydrolyzed collagen, portulaca oleracea extract, witch hazel extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, snail secretion filtrate, honey extract, ubiquinone, dipotassium glycyrrhizate, fragrance.\n\nSo not the best ingredient list for everyone, but far and away not the worst.  Again, a full 23ml of essence in each mask, substantial but soft and pliable mask material, and it really does smell very luxurious.  It's also very gentle (for me) on my skin, and **did I mention they're $3.33 for a pack of 10 on RRS???**\n\nThese masks are truly a hidden gem, and I will probably get every variety they make in my next haul!\n\nEdit: Holy crap, you guys.  I took this off after 40 minutes, and I look.....AMAZING!  My skin is radiant, fat, and SUUUPER calm.  I used the extra essence on my chest, and swear to snail, if you  put me in a corset right now, I could stop or start a war.  Maybe start one then stop it five minutes later, my bosom is so luminous.  I also would seriously consider buying this scent as a perfume, it's that pleasant.  For reference, I have combo/oily aging skin with PIH and--touch wood--no allergies or reactions so far.",

You can see the image of a jar spilling out the the cream to make the shape of a face or a face mask.\nThe back packaging has some some of its instructions printed in both Korean and also English with pictures on how to use the mask properly.\nThe ingredients were also stated at the back along with the expiration date.\n\nREVIEW:\nThe sheet itself was protected between two layers of film and divided into two parts, the upper part and lower part which was quite convenient to use.\nInstead of the clear essence/serum, it has a white gel-like cream with a thicker consistency than the typical essence in sheet masks.\nThis mask felt cooling on my skin and it did indeed soothe the redness and calming those zits on my face.\nThe after effect left my skin looking clear and moisturized. It gives me that healthy and radiant glow to my skin. I almost resisted putting on a moisturizer and night cream due to the moistness it provided to my face.\nHowever, the effect only lasted for 2-3 days but I'm sure with constant use, my skin will continue to improve.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis mask evened out my skin tone and made my face look plump. It also deeply moisturized my skin and provides a cooling sensation to it. The mask is good for pampering yourself after having a hectic day, preferably during night time. I recommend this mask to anyone with dry skin and also to those looking for a 2-in-1 mask (soothing+hydrating).\n\nRATING:\n8/10",

It smells like dried rose petal but it didn't bother me much. I didn't get any breakouts when I introduced it, so Yay!!!!\nI bought it when I saw 5 types of HA and  peptides in Limese Ad. Unfortunately, peptides are way below in the ingredients list. So can't expect anti- aging benefits from this toner. But I have to say it hydrates the skin really really well. It plumps up the skin whenever I do 3-skin method with this. It's a very good hydrating toner.\n\nHG status: WNRP I guess, not because it's a bad product or anything. It's just I bought it as I couldn't get Kikumasamune high moist lotion.",

I won't list the product here. (No changes in his medications)I'm listing the product ingredients and want to know what could possibly the reason for actual hairgrowth from people who know it better. There seems to be no Minox in there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: \"Skrzypovita Serum Pro\", because of all the downvotes here you have it holy xd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story is below the Ingredients. It's the same Ingredient order as on the package.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* Aqua, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Propanediol, Arginine, Lactic Acid, Glycine Soja Germ Extract, Triticum Vulgare Germ Extract, Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Glycerin, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf Extract, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Arnica Montana Flower Extract, Lamium Album Extract, Salvia Officinalis Leaf Extract, Pinus Sylvestris Bud Extract, Nasturtium Officinale Extract, Arctium Majus Root Extract, Citrus Limon Peel Extract, Hedera Helix Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Tropaeolum Majus Flower Extract, Urtica Dioica Leaf Extract, Betula Alba Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense Extract, Actinidia Chinensis Fruit Extract, Cucumis Sativus Fruit Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Biotin, Glycoproteins, Ethoxydiglycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Pyridoxine HCI, Panthenol, Zinc Chloride, Acetyl Cysteine, Glutamine, Methionine, Saccharomyces Lysate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylalycerin. Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Lactate\n\nSo my Dad is 90% bald on the top with little small hair in the crownarea and some on the front between the temples. Huge donorarea tho. He has been like this for the last 20 years. But somehow he just noticed like a year ago that he went bald lol when I complained about my own hair. Even his ID 10 years ago shows him being in the same state as he is now.So he bought some random shampoo's and gave up on them. But he keeps using a \"serum\" which is just advertised in my land. And two weeks ago he said, \"my hair is getting back\" and my Mom agreed that he is really growing some hairs.I ignored it knowing how hard it actually is to get it back after spending thousand of hours reading about hairloss.But I remember checking his scalp from time to time, just cuz fkit I'm balding and wanted to see what I will end up with ok xd. And he is getting more hairs, his crownarea is of course thin af, but there are more hairs then some months ago.The package of the product says the same thing that we know from Minox. \"Takes 2-4months of use to see any difference and that it puts hairs into the anagen phase and keeps them there for longer period of time. Reduces hairloss up to 60%\"But there is no minox in here so what could be the reason it's doing any work?\n\nI buzzed my hair yesterday, thinking to try it out cuz I've lost the fight anyway. But I don't want to put something up there when I've no idea what it is for the rest of my days.",

    "body": "A while back, I really wanted to simplify my haircare routine and tried cowashing, but didn't have much success with it. I read every how-to guide, tried a ton of different conditioners, and just eventually decided maybe it wasn't for me.\n\nFast forward to last weekend- I went out of town and just threw a couple of random shampoo and conditioner samples I had on hand into my bag. One of them was a [Sachajuan Hair Cleansing Cream](https://shop.sachajuan.com/products/hair-cleansing-cream)\n\nI got to the hotel, realized it wasn't a shampoo and decided to give it a shot according to the package directions. I had low expectations, but it was AMAZING. My hair looked great air dried with no product, and the wash lasted with just a little dry shampoo for a solid week.\n\nI looked into buying a bottle and it is really outside my budget. I am willing to pay for good quality hair products, and I can technically afford it, but we're trying to save up right now, so I'm hoping there is something close, even if not an exact dupe, available for less $$.\n\nThe ingredients are: AQUA (WATER),GLYCERIN, ISOPROPYL PALMITATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE,GLYCERYL STEARATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), HYDROLYZED RHODOPHYCEA (RED ALGAE) EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, DICAPRYLYL ETHER, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, LINALOOL, LIMONENE.\n\nI've searched the sub and read a lot about what different ingredients do, but I'm not sure what's most important here?\n\nSo my question: am I just looking for something with glycerin high up on the ingredients list? Is there some combination of these ingredients that's most important? Or should I just suck it up and buy the real thing?\n\nIf it matters, I have thick, wavy hair that tends to be oily. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!",

If you really really don‚Äôt want a cut at all ask for a wash and style so that you can have time to ask about products during your appointment. You will get a much better recommendation by making an appointment and they can even try out what you want to buy on you before you purchase and take it home! \nSide note: if you use a sulfate free shampoo always wash twice! They are so gentle once is usually not sufficient. Even washing twice you use less than a typical drugstore shampoo.",

    "body": "**Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence SPF 50+ PA+++**\n\nWell, I think it has finally happened‚Ä¶I‚Äôm officially out of my sunscreen rut LOL! I had such a good experience with the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence last month‚Ä¶and this product from Troiareuke is another really nice chemical (and a bit of physical) sunscreen.\n\nIf I thought the lightweight feel of the Soft Airy UV Essence was special‚Ä¶this sunscreen from Troiareuke goes a step further. This formula is one of the thinnest and most lightweight feeling sunscreens I have used! And, considering this is a denatured/drying alcohol free formula‚Ä¶it‚Äôs kind of incredible. I‚Äôve only felt this type of watery consistency with some Japanese sunscreens that are usually heavy on the Alcohol Denat. \n\nInactive ingredients include various texturizes, stabilizers, and silicones followed by fragrance (yeah‚Ä¶we will get there). Aloe Leaf Juice, Sodium Hyaluronate, and Centella Asiatica can also be found in this formula. Active ingredients include some fairly common chemical sunscreen filters (at least for K-Beauty)‚Ä¶but Titanium Dioxide in a rather small 1.49% makes an appearance as well. To be honest, the extracts and ingredients following fragrance were kind of lost on me. I didn‚Äôt see any soothing or exceptionally hydrating result from this product. But, I was really here for the feel and protection‚Ä¶so no hard feelings there. \n\nOkay, going back to the scent LOL! This product has a rather strong and slightly lingering clean/floral/powdery scent‚Ä¶and I do not like it. Similar to my one complaint about the Troiareuke ACSEN Pore Control Mask‚Ä¶I have no idea why the brand chose to add fragrance to a line geared towards acne prone/sensitive skin. Because of the texture and result this sunscreen still falls into my ‚Äúlove it‚Äù category. But, it would have been so much more amazing to me had Troiareuke omitted the scent.\n\nApplication of this product is pretty straightforward‚Ä¶just slather it on LOL! But, the silicones really help this sunscreen to spread around and distribute super evenly. I was never left worried that I missed a spot as everything glides and smoothes around the nose and chin. The little bit of Titanium Dioxide does leave behind the slightest of white-cast‚Ä¶but it absorbs/disappears within seconds and was actually helpful to see where I might need a bit more product. I never thought I would refer to physical filters in a sunscreen as being ‚Äúbeneficial‚Äù (at least for my darker skin tone)‚Ä¶but here we are LOL!\n\nOnce absorbed, this product leaves a VERY dewy and slightly shiny look behind. I know a lot of people (including my oily/combination skin peeps) might not like this ‚Äúnearly greasy‚Äù feel/look‚Ä¶but I really love the ultra-dewy result. It might not be something I appreciate as much in the hotter months. The high amount of silicones helped to create this effect without the literal ‚Äúgrease‚Äù feeling though. Plus, they are a decent occlusives and help to hold in the hydration from toners/essences/lotions. I‚Äôve used this product multiple times a day for the past couple fo weeks with no breakouts or excessively clogged pores.\n\nIn fact‚Ä¶this sunscreen provided a slight ‚Äúpore blurring‚Äù effect (thanks silicones) much like the ACSEN Pore Control Mask. In it‚Äôs ability to mask larger pores and create a more even looking texture‚Ä¶the ACSEN line from Troiareuke has really wowed me so far. \n\nProtection was just fine when using the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. Even though I am used to using products with a PA Rating of ‚Äú++++‚Äù‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt see any increase in redness or darkening of my skin with this PA+++ product. I feel like the Titanium Dioxide in this product helped to ‚Äúreflect‚Äù and dissipate a bit more rays causing me to feel slightly more cool/comfortable in the sun. This benefit was really minimal to be honest but it was something I did notice.\n\nSo, overall‚Ä¶a really good sunscreen. Aside, from the fragrance this product was a total win. But, it is most likely something I won‚Äôt be coming back to and would probably NEVER be a sunscreen I would recommend. GASP‚Ä¶such a change of heart. Here‚Äôs why‚Ä¶\n\nThe Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence‚Ä¶in all of it‚Äôs 50ml‚Ä¶is priced at $55.00 USD on Soko Glam as well as the majority of sellers I looked up. Rarely does this sunscreen go on sale and if so the discounts are minimal. To me, this is simply too expensive for a sunscreen of this size. \n\nIt honestly frustrates and saddens me to see a sunscreen product this good be priced at such a prohibitive price point. I am a firm believer that sunscreen is the number one most important step in an effective skincare routine‚Ä¶but something at this cost excludes so many potential buyers. I would hate for someone to take a look at this product and say ‚ÄúNope! I guess a good sunscreen is just too much for me‚Ä¶and the less expensive ones don‚Äôt work for me‚Ä¶so no sunscreen I guess!‚Äù\n\nI absolutely appreciate the elegant and super dewy finish as well as finally finding a part physical product that doesn‚Äôt make me look like a ghost (LOL)‚Ä¶I just cant see myself burning through 2 bottles a month (which is my current rate for 50ml sunscreens) and dropping $110 USD for them. IT MAKES NO SENSE LOL! I was lucky enough to find this sunscreen on Amazon for Buy 1 Get 1 Free‚Ä¶but it was a promotion that they forgot to remove from the site so I had to fight to get the deal. Outside of that (like I said earlier), I haven‚Äôt found them for much less than full price.\n\nRecently‚Ä¶I‚Äôve taken to calling products that have exceptionally potentially irritating ingredients lists and/or unreasonably high prices (in my opinion) ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù for me to recommend. This sunscreen from Troiareuke falls into that category‚Ä¶I just cant LOL!\n\nMaybe, just maybe‚Ä¶this could be a ‚Äúspecial occasion‚Äù sunscreen that you wear when that intense glow is super important. With the high amount of silicones in the formula‚Ä¶I could also see this product being excellent to wear under makeup as a primer/for that high sheen ‚Äúshow off that glow at the wedding‚Äù look. \n\nBut, for those that want the same protection, lack of white-cast, and a really nice dewy finish (although more watery and less shiny)‚Ä¶the Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence is your new BFF. I love that product for all the same reasons as the Troiareuke ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. However, the fragrance is so much more bearable and it comes in at less than half the cost. If purchasing at Wishtrend‚Ä¶you can get 160ml of the Klairs sunscreen and still have $9.00 USD in your pocket for the price of one ACSEN U.V Protector Essence. I mean‚Ä¶come on.\n\nIf you have the extra cash and want to go ‚Äúall out‚Äù with a sunscreen purchase‚Ä¶this is a worthy choice. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an affordable and well performing sunscreen. \n\nFull Ingredients List:\n\nWater, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Homosalate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Pentylene Glycol, Methylpropanediol, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Caprylyl Methicone, Titanium Dioxide, Isononyl Isononanoate, Ethylhexyl Triazone, Lauryl Methacrylate/Glycol Dimethacrylate Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Sodium Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Aluminum Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Fragrance, Allantoin, Polysorbate 80, Butylene Glycol, Sorbitan Oleate, Xanthan Gum, BHT, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Biosaccharide Gum-4, Sodium Hyaluronate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Ethylhexylglycerin, Propylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Extensin, Niacinamide, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, Centella Asiatica Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Glycerin, Cyanocobalamin, Biotin, Ascorbyl Glucoside, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Copper Tripeptide-1, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8\n\nWhere To Buy (Soko Glam $55.00 USD): [https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence](https://sokoglam.com/collections/troiareuke/products/troiareuke-acsen-uv-protector-essence)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kir0vv5f30x41.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0661e8956db35e86a155f8d487f1d6f8e3b752a9",

I'm always on the look out for fragrance-free milk and cream cleansers, and I don't like to spend a lot on them really, I'd rather drop the ¬£¬£ elsewhere in my routine. This one contains meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil and shea butter, which is nice because I always like a few oils in a second/AM cleanser to replace what's lost when you wash your face. It also contains a couple polymers, which apparently stop surfactants from penetrating too deeply and over cleansing your skin. The high oil content here might even mean that this cleanser can break down makeup and water resistant sunscreens, but I haven't tried it to find out yet!\n\nThe surfactants used don't look particularly interesting and seem few and far between, so perhaps this is a better option for those who use a washcloth or who like cleansers that leave a light emollient film, but I thought I'd share this on here since I've never really seen a cleanser this budget (¬£2 for 200ml!) with such a good INCI. Presumably it's pretty accessible too since it's Sainsbury's own brand, if it's sold in most stores then it'd be pretty easy just to pick up with your shop. It looks like a great budget option for anyone with dry or sensitive skin - isopropyl myristate can be an acne trigger for some so be mindful of that, but it‚Äôs in a good few of my favourite cleansers and despite being super acne prone it never breaks me out.\n\nThey also do a [foaming facial wash](https://incidecoder.com/products/source-of-nature-facial-wash) that looks pretty great too - I don't usually bother with foaming cleansers but the ingredients here look pretty promising and it's ¬£2 for 150ml. Come to think of it, it actually looks more interesting than the milk - lots of glycerin, two really great gentle surfactants, soybean oil, but sadly no polymers unlike the milk. They do a toner and a couple night creams (toner doesn't look up to much but the creams look nice), and an eye makeup remover that might be worth looking into too.

If you're interested in Lululun's products, I recommend picking up their weekly mask packs as a sort of trial period, if you will. I wish I did this. I'm not looking to fear monger or anything like that, either. \n\nIngredients: Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Alpha-Glucan Oligosaccharide, Honey, Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract, Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine) Peel Extract, Yeast Extract, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben \n\n[Source](https://www.lululunusa.com/lululun-face-mask-pink-36-sheets.html)\n\nType of skin: Combination (meaning it can be dry one day and oily the next)\n\nSensitive skin: Yes.\n\nSkin concerns: Minor uneven skin, lack of hydration, redness in some places along with some acne here and there.\n\nThe pros I can get into about these masks is that the mask itself fits pretty well on my face. The material also makes the application process quick and painless. I typically left it on for 10 minutes, sometimes a bit more. Afterwards, my face would feel plump to the touch and actually pretty smooth. I enjoyed how satisfying the experience of wearing it felt and how there would be this \"cooling\" sensation (probably due to the A/C in my home) I'd get from wearing them. I was going in the direction of mainly wearing these masks to the point where I bought more than just the singular box I've been using. Hindsight is 20x20, I wish I waited it out a bit more because of the cons that I experienced. \n\nAt some point in my experience of using the mask, I began to encounter some sort of skin irritation/burning on my upper cheeks around my nose, just a quarter inch below my eyes. Basically around where my cheekbones are located. I was a bit disheartened to find that yes, I was experiencing the issue many have mentioned in and outside of the subreddit. If I were to put it on a 1-10 scale of how intense the burning felt, I'd say it is about a 4, sometimes 5. At times, the sensation would go down to 2.5. I used this particular mask a few more times to see if it was just me. Now looking back, this was not a good idea. \n\nI tried it one more time tonight and I couldn't keep the mask on for more than 2 minutes because of the burning. I genuinely thought it was the product combination I used (Senka and Hada Labo products), but it turns out that it is the mask. I re-washed and everything so all is good. But the conclusion I've come to throughout all this is that I'm probably not going to be using Lululun products going forward because of how it affects me. Again, I'm not looking to fear monger or say that you shouldn't use their products but, even in their most recent formulation, skin irritation is still fairly present in at least the mask variant I used. Definitely try to get the 7 pc masks to try them out first. I can genuinely see why they are one of the best selling masks in Japan. \n\nMy skin personally didn't respond well to the mask at the end of the day. Everyone's skin is different. I'm going to be sticking to Kose mainly, but might try Senka's and Hada Labo's masks at some point for the heck of it. I'm going to try and cross reference the ingredients of the Kose mask I do have with Lululun's and see if there's just an ingredient I really should avoid going forward.\n\nEdit 08/19/2021\nAfter some light cross referencing, I came to the conclusion that a specific called citric acid is likely to have caused the irritation and burning. I'm not sure if this means the mask itself is too acidic for me, but I'm choosing to stay away from products that have citric acid in it. Which would mean doing away with the regular, precious, and over 45 line of Lululun. It is a shame because I loved these masks when they didn't affect me the way they do, but it's not worth skin irritation let alone burning to use them.",

The mask is quite transparent, so if you have acne or redness you should be able to see it underneath \n\nI will now type out the ingredients \n\nWater, Glycosy Trehalsoe/Hydrogenated Starch Hydrolysate (Trehalose), Xanthan gum, MethylParaben, Phenoxyethanol, Tranexamic Acd, D-Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Collagen, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Alpha-Arbutin, Allantoin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate, Hyaluronic acid, Frangrance (HAHA OATMEAL FRAGRANCE). \n\nSo. as we can see here This IS SOME PRETTY cheap stuff. \nI believe it's around $10 usd or 300 if you're in Taiwan. So would I buy this? NO haha my mom buys this for me and I am 100% appreciative. I think it's most effective for anyone who's skin is mildy oil with a few pimples at times. IF YOU have a bit of extreme acne (borderline cystic or pretty much cystic ;A;) it doesn't break me out. \n2/5 I use this when I run out of my vitamin c stuff (dr wu or dewytree) \n\nThank you for reading ;A; ",

    "body": "You may have heard of the Swiss brand, **La Prairie**. It is well-known for two reasons: history and price It's a really big name brand with a history, and **a price** point several times higher than many premium brands. In February, they released a new product **priced at $1,980**!!! Which is very expensive for 24 ml.  \n‚†Ä  \n**So, what's inside**? I reached out to La Prairie for the full list of ingredients in this cocktail. They kindly answered and sent the full list (I'll put it at the end)\n\nThis is a quite impressive cocktail. I was initially skeptical about it, as I am about most highly-priced products. It is clear from the ads how much money and effort is invested in the product.  \n‚†Ä  \nAs promised by the manufacturer, the product contains *a special mixture* of a couple of glycoproteins derived from yeast and *Lactobacillus*, *ginseng*, and *horsetail extracts*. It can be found in many La Prairie products. The distinctive component is *colloidal platinum*, and what‚Äôs even more interesting is the *mixture of growth factors* of plant origin. Plus, there‚Äôs a mixture of moisturizing ingredients (*amino acids, minerals, saccharides*). This is what a good anti-aging serum should look like.\n\nEven though the composition may look amazing, don‚Äôt let appearances be deceptive. The base of the composition is growth factors (plant) and good old Matrixil, and there are other cocktails containing this type of base which are as efficient, and much cheaper.\n\nLooking at the packaging of the product, it looks as if it‚Äôs worth even more than the 24ml product itself! \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt mind having this cocktail in my routine, but not at this price. Would you buy this product?\n\n\\---- The ingredients list ----\n\nWater (Aqua), Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Caprylic/Capric/Succinic Triglyceride, Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane, **Glycoproteins\\*, Panax Ginseng Root Extract\\*, Equisetum Arvense Extract\\*, Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Extract\\*, Lactobacillus Ferment\\*, Colloidal Platinum, Sodium Hyaluronate**, Argania Spinosa Extract, Lycium Barbarum Fruit Extract, Rosa Rugosa Leaf Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Extract, **Oligopeptide-6, Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4, Nicotiana Benthamiana Octapeptide-30 SH-Oligopeptide-2, Nicotiana Benthamiana Hexapeptide-40 SH-Oligopeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-10, Decapeptide-4**, Arginine, Threonine, Lysine HCL, Histidine, Serine, Glycine, Tryptophan, Soluble Collagen, Chitosan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Sodium Mannose Phosphate, Mannose, Folic Acid, Calcium Pantothenate, Propanediol, Cellulose, Isomalt, Phospholipids, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Glucose, Xanthan Gum, Tin Oxide, PPG-26-Buteth-26, Ethylhexylglycerin, Synthetic Fluorphlogopite, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Chloride, Magnesium Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Phosphate, Polysorbate 80, Sodium Oleate, Cysteine, Benzotriazolyl Dodecyl P-Cresol, Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Alcohol, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Dehydroacetate, Potassium Sorbate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Ext.

    "body": "I submitted a review for this sunscreen on SCA a week or two ago and I thought it'd be more appropriate for this sub :)\n\nQuick info about my sunscreen history: very sensitive, extremely acne prone, have tried over a dozen brand of sunscreens.  I really liked the Biore watery essence when I first purchased it but that sadly broke me out and had a really dry finish due to the alcohol.  I tried sunscreens from Shiseido, Eltamd, Nivea, various Japanese brands, Neutrogena, La Roche, etc.  I did recently purchase Missha All Around Safe Block Essence Sun because I've heard so many rave reviews about it and I am also eyeing Mentholatum Sunplay Skin Aqua but for now I am really happy with lookatme Jelly Sunscreen and I would like to share my thoughts on it with you guys :)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/YeV1n\n\nIt's made by a Korean cosmetic company called lookatme (http://lookatmecos.co.kr). The product is called a \"Jelly sunscreen\" with a SPF 50 and PA+++. Check out the ingredients list here:\n\n\nINGREDIENTS: Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Orchid Extract, Crinum Asiaticum Extract, Dendrobium Phalaenopsis Flower Extract, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, **Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate**, **Titanium Dioxide**, **Zinc Oxide**, Butylene Glycol, Betaine, Carbomer, Polyoxyethylene Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Allantoin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Collagen, **Hyaluronic Acid**, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, 1, 2 - Hexanediol, **Tocopheryl Acetate**, Morus Alba Bark Extract, Perfume\n\nThe formulation looked extremely promising to me before I went on ahead and purchased this. Now, by no means do I believe natural = always better for your skin, but I really liked the fact I could recognize most of the ingredients on the list. A quick search on cosdna showed that none of the ingredients were problematic. I went ahead and bought it. Three weeks later, I am so happy I did.\n\nThe fourth picture shows how the product looks like initially from the tube. It is opaque, watery, gel-like. The fifth picture shows how my skin appears immediately after rubbing in the product. The product goes on quite easily, just like rubbing in aloe vera gel. The scent is quite strong though, if you are familiar with Korean cosmetics, it has that citrus-y soapy smell. It doesn't bother me too much and it goes away with time. The sixth picture shows how my skin appears 10 minutes after application. The product does not leave you feeling sticky and absorbs quite well.\n\n\nMore importantly, I have not broken out since and it has given me great sun protection :D\n\nOverall, I give it a 9.5/10, the only thing I would change is the scent.\n\nHere is a link if you are interested: http://www.amazon.com/Sunscreen-Stickiness-Protection-Hyaluronic-Moisturizer/dp/B011YJICXW/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1441848238&sr=8-2-fkmr1&keywords=lookatme+jelly+sunscreen\n\nEdit: here's the page about it from the website if you Korean speaking ABers want to read more about it: http://m.lookatmecos.co.kr/product/detail.html?product_no=156&cate_no=1&display_group=2",

Maybe alcohol = bad for me or...\n\nSo basically this is me saying any ingredient in Canmake is totally fine with me. If y'all have any suggestions with these (list below) then it's A-Ok with me!

    "body": "Ladies and gents. Today was a great day. Today I received my Gudetama sheet masks in the mail.\n\nNow I will admit 100% I bought these because they're aodrable and I love Gudetama. The ingredients list isn't bad, but it's nothing exceptional either:\n\nWater, methylpropanediol, 1,2-hexanediol, butylene glycol, egg yolk extract, albumen extract, aloe vera leaf extract, green tea water, tea tree leaf water, cypress water, calendula officinalis Extract, Sodium hyaluronate, allantoin , panthenol, trehalose, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, carbomer, tromethamine, ammonium acryloyldimethyltaurate/ VP copolymer, xanthan gum, caprylyl glycol, disodium EDTA, ethylhexylglycerin, ethyl hexanediol, phenoxyethanol, perfume\n\nIt looks like a pretty standard moisturising mask, no fancy amazing ingredients. I also love that there's egg yolk in the ingredients! How sweet!\n\nOnto the actual performance!\n\nGuys. The fit on this is TERRIBLE. And the material it's made of is so thick and... unyielding? It's so hard to get it to sit right, it often hangs in places and won't really stay in the contours of your face. I don't know if anyone else feels this way but when the mask material itself isn't physically in contact with my face and instead sort of hangs off I feel like it might as well not be there in terms of effectiveness. This mask does that a lot. Also the amount of mask between the nose and lips is super long! Overall very uncomfortable to wear.\n\nI wouldn't say the mask is soaked in essence, but it's not super dry. I think the texture and thickness of the mask material makes is seem drier than it actually is. The mask has a sort of sweet floral scent, I personally don't think it's overpowering but I'm rarely bothered by fragrance in products. There's only a few dribbles left in the packet afterwards, so it's not one of those masks that seems like it has enough essence for two masks.\n\n[PICTURES!](http://i.imgur.com/sTMU97Y.jpg) It's so cute omg. Skincaretertainment at it's finest.\n\nI left it on about 30 minutes, the sheet felt quite dry but my face was still very wet with essence so I think it just felt dry because of the mask material. I patted in the remaining essence and it ends up with a nice, non-sticky finish. \n\n[My face immediately afterwards if this is useful?](http://i.imgur.com/vkuYzzQ.jpg) (sorry I didn't think to take a before) (also WARNING this is super high resolution, you can see all my pores and stray eyebrow hairs!) (also ignore the spot on my lashline lol)\n\nAs you can see I have a little PIE on my cheeks but nothing major, and no active pimples. My skin tends to lean normal nowadays, but is in the drier side. The mask wasn't super brightening or anything but it was very soothing and made the redness on my face less apparent. I wouldn't say it's HEAVY moisture, but it's quite nice and hydrating without being heavy. I think it would be really nice for the summer, very soothing and not too heavy - but there are probably better options for those with very dry skin or during harsh winter months. I think it would also be nice for people with oilier skin due to the non-heavy finish.\n\n**OVERALL:** I'd give this mask about 3/5. Firstly it's adorable, like Gudetama is hugging my face. I actually liked the effects, my skin tends to get flushed easily and it felt nice and soothing. It wasn't too heavy, most masks are really sticky afterwards and I liked that this wasn't, especially with the weather heating up. I just wish the fit and material were better! However, I will use up the rest of the ones I have.\n",

Holy moly, I will never use holika holika masks again. Money wasted. The smell to me is too over powering and it's very I'll fitting and thick. I'm sad because I also bought the cleansing tissue and sheet mask and I'm going to give it away because it's to irritating. I have tried nature republic, the face shop and tonymoly sheet masks and those never irritated me like this one. :(",
