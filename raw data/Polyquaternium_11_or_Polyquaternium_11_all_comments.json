The fourth ingredient is amodimethicone (following water, cetearyl alcohol, and behentrimonium chloride). I'd use it with a shampoo containing cocamidopropyl betaine. I saw a gentle shampoo from Cantu that looks like it could work really well, but for some reason the listed ingredients differ between websites. \n\nMy question is, would this conditioner work as a substitute for heat protectant spray? I flat iron on occasion. What if I were to use it as a leave-in? (This might be too heavy for my hair though). I'm not a huge fan of sprays because the spray usually gets on my face and can cause breakouts, and it's hard to get even coverage. \n\nEDIT: I also found this leave-in that supposedly only contains water-soluble silicones - [Bed Head Control Freak Serum](https://www.ulta.com/bed-head-control-freak-serum?productId=xlsImpprod4750119) - but it's a little pricey, and I also don't know if the water-soluble silicones are strong enough or high enough in the ingredient list to offer adequate heat protection.

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn‚Äôt have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat. This will give you an idea of how effective your product is working. \n Also with liquid sprays you can spray the product your hand and apply to avoid contact with your face. Hope this helps.",

    "body": "# Protecting Your Hair from Heat Damage\n\nProducts that claim to reduce damage to your hair when used during styling with heat tools like blow dryers, curling irons and flat irons are considered heat protection. They can come in the form of sprays, creams, lotions and/or serums. In this post, I break down how to think about the temperature of your heat styling tools and the product ingredients that are best for heat protection.‚Äã (This is the full blog beside a diagram of all the heats listed below, the post is a bit better organized on my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Effects of Heat Damage**The diagram below shows how hair reacts to different blowdryer temperatures. A good blowdryer can be judged by (1) how strong the air flow, or blow force, is from the device and (2) how hot that air can get. The cost of a blowdryer can range anywhere from $20 to $250+, with the more expensive brands often offering better quality tooling that produces those effects to a greater degree. Those factors matter because they can contribute to cutting your blowdry time in half,¬†which is a life saver when¬†you have an 8am meeting to get to. However, more powerful tools are only useful if you know how to use them. Often people mistakenly abuse a higher quality blowdryer by overheating areas of their hair, or by not concentrating on certain spots for long enough.  \n\n\nAt work and at home, I use a¬†[Dyson Supersonic](https://www.dyson.com/hair-care/hair-dryers/supersonic) blowdryer. I frequently use the \"fast drying and styling\" temperature (shown on the diagram below) on my own hair and with clients.¬† The \"cooler drying and diffusing\" setting is more commonly used on curly hair, while \"constant cold\" is for smoothing your blowdry with a blast of cool air right after it's done.  \n\n\nWhen considering the diagram below, imagine what a strand of hair looks like under a microscope (visual [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=hair+under+microscope&oq=hair+under+microscope&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i512l5j0i22i30l4.2387j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)). A healthy strand will appear smooth, while a damaged strand will appear rough and as though jagged shingles are coating the outside. Those jagged shingles are cracks in the hair's cuticle that are caused by overuse of heat and chemicals. I give an overview of the risks of different types of hair damage in my post [Hair Challenges: Part I](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---dry-hair.html) and [Part II](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---build-up.html). In general, with heat damage your hair is more likely to break, tangle, have unexpected reactions to color, and adopt casts of green or orange by soaking up minerals from your tap water. These conditions make it¬†harder to grow and maintain your hair over time.¬†\n\n**‚ÄãHeat Protection Ingredients**Now that we have a little insight on how heat affects hair, let's look at some ingredients that can help create a barrier from that heat. According to [L'Or√©al](https://www.lorealparisusa.com/beauty-magazine/hair-care/damaged-hair/heat-protectant-for-hair.aspx),¬†their products are \"often¬†formulated to protect hair from temperatures as high as 450 degrees\", which means some products are designed to protect from heat all the way up to the \"danger zone\". There is more to maintaining healthy hair than heat protection alone, but when that is top of mind for you below is a list of ingredients that will help, plus a few to avoid.\n\n**Protein:**¬†found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* P/DMAPA Acrylates Copolymer¬†\n* Protein polysiloxane copolymer\n* 2% glycerin (that is a lot for any formulation)¬†\n* Polyquaternium-55¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein¬†\n* Hydrolyzed vegetable protein PG-propyl silanetriol¬†\n* Hydrolyzed wheat protein PG-propyl silanetriol\n\n‚Äã  \n**Oils and Silicones:**¬†products that disperse heat, found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Sodium polystyrene sulfonate ([stable up to 576¬∞F](https://salonkhouri.com/blog/2018/04/10/whats-inside-killer-curls/))\n* Sodium laureth-40 maleate/styrene sulfonate copolymer¬†\n* Dimethicone\n* Amodimethicone\n\n**Conditioning Agents:**¬†not found to prevent cuticle cracking¬†\n\n* Polyquaternium-11\n* Cetrimonium chloride\n* Stearalkonium chloride\n* Quaternium 70 (Stearamidopropyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Triglycerides, silicones, mineral oils and petrolatum\n\n*Sources:* [*How Hot is Too Hot for Healthy Hair?*¬†](https://science-yhairblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/how-hot-is-too-hot-for-healthy-hair.html)*by the Science-y Hair Blog*  \n[*The Cracking of Human Hair Cuticles by Cyclical Thermal Stresses*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286849276_The_cracking_of_human_hair_cuticles_by_cyclical_thermal_stresses)*, Manuel Gamez-Garcia*",

Back then I didn't think it helped much with my hair, but I was also using some shampoos and conditioner with protein (and cones)\n\nAs of now I'm using Aubreys Honeysuckle rose conditioner or something, the protein free one. It's not super, but it's alright. I'm willing to use the whole bottle and maybe buy again.\n\nI am also currently using Kinky Curly Knot today, but to be honest it does little to nothing for my hair. If I use just a bit too much, my hair looks really weird and dirty, and it doesn't give any bounce to my hair.\n\nI've been using Head and shoulders the past three weeks as I think I might have Seborrheic dermatitis. The shampoo is drying my hair, but my scalp seems pretty satisfied (less sebum build up, no irritation, and my scalp is pretty sensitive to even good brands). I will not continue to use H&S, but maybe periodically if there seems to be a sebum issue again.\n\nIdeally I would not be using much shampoo. Maybe just ACV and baking soda rinse now and then.\n\nI'm waiting for a Giovanni shampoo bought on Iherb to bring out the colour of my blonde hair, which I will be using only now and then. (It's got cones, the one called amodimethicone (supposedly a \"good\" quality cone?)\n\nI'd prefer my hair would be cone free, and I will try to keep it fairly cone light atleast. I don't mind cones much, I just hate the build up on blonde hair and feeling like I rely on cones, haha. But mainly I want to stear clear from protein.\n\n\nMy hair is btw 2a/2b, mousey blonde during winters, thick and extremely coarse, and also very frizzy.\n\nThese are the ingredients in the KMS Tame Frizz creme. Can anyone tell me if there are any sort of proteins in it? I will try to only use a small amount of this just to see how my hair will respond now that I don't use the same shampoo/conditioner as I did last summer.\n\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetyl Acetate, VP/VA Copolymer, Isopropyl Myristate, Sorbitan Oleate, Lanolin Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Butyl Stearate, Lanolin Oil, Chitosan, Glycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Caryocar Brasiliense Fruit Oil, Acacia Seyal Gum Extract, Silicone Quaternium-22, Oleyl Acetate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Glycyl Glycine, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Acetamide MEA, Stearyl Acetate, Propylene Glycol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-11, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tetrasodium EDTA, PPG-3 Myristyl Ether, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance / Parfum.",

Also, the salicylic acid is only 0.5%, when usually we recommend 2%.  We also don't know if the pH is low enough to actually be effective.\n\nI'm personally just not a fan of benzoyl peroxide.

However, on your ingredients list I would put the 1% mark at Triethanolamine. TEA is primarily used in cosmetics as a pH adjustor, so it would be unusual for it to be present at greater than a 1% concentration. Just ahead of TEA on the ingredients list is the emulsifier Polysorbate 20, and it's a safe bet that's present at greater than 1%. So I would guess TEA and everything below it on the ingredients list is used at less than 1%. Note that anything present <1% may be listed in random order; that's permitted under US and EU labeling regulations.\n\nSome of these ingredients will probably not be available from suppliers that serve the DIY/maker market, so you may need to figure out substitutions. Again, I don't know much about hair products, but I know POI has lots of hair product formulas and advice, so you won't go wrong using it as a resource.",

Two of those Organix products you listed have Dimethicone, which is a silicone.  Can't tell if the shampoo is ok but I have checked a few Organix shampoos at my local drugstore and I found a few with sulfates.  \n\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo is also listed there but has sulfates.  I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.  There is also a product recommendation link at the sidebar in /r/haircarescience.  But before you buy, google the ingredients just in case the manufacturer changed ingredients",

I know that there was someone who mixed topical Finasteride with lipids to give it a higher molecular weight, but that still goes systematic. My other post was about a hydrophobic topical Finasteride which would be harder to do, but why not just mix topical Finasteride with something that physically cannot penetrate the scalp. Like the molecule pp405 is using. They claim that their solution will stay topical in the scalp. Why not use that molecule with topical Finasteride. \n\n I asked chat gpt for some other examples of bases and they gave me this: Polyquaternium-11 (or Polyquaternium-7):\n\t‚Ä¢\tPolyquaternium compounds are large-molecule, water-soluble polymers that are commonly used in hair and skin products. They form a thick, non-penetrating layer on the skin and hair. Polyquaternium-11, in particular, has a high molecular weight and is often used for conditioning, moisturizing, and forming protective barriers.\n\t‚Ä¢\tIt creates a flexible, smooth layer that doesn‚Äôt allow active ingredients or environmental elements to penetrate deeply.\nHydrolyzed Silk Protein:\n\t‚Ä¢\tSilk proteins have a high molecular weight and can help condition and protect the scalp without deep absorption. When hydrolyzed (broken into smaller fragments), they still have large molecular structures and stay on the surface, providing a smooth coating effect.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThese proteins also help improve the appearance of hair without penetrating deeply into the skin.\n\nWe quite literally have the mechanism that stops hairloss but 1-5% of people get sides from them (some think higher). Why is no company exploring a side effect free Finasteride?! Please someone poke holes into this argument. Not sure why a bunch of different bases with a topical Finasteride wasn‚Äôt tested or at the very least the molecule that pp405 is using can‚Äôt be used in topical Finasteride ",

    "body": "I've worn my ring for more than 2 years while doing dishes, taking a shower, cleaning the house with various cleaners.....  I don't use much for caustic cleaners or things that leave a lot of residue due to the number of pets we have so I rarely have to worry about damaging the ring and only occasionally take it off first.\n\nSomehow while giving the fluffy husky a bath I rather severely burnt my finger.  I don't have anything that can focus well enough to take a pic and my husband has not been interested in helping with his amazing quality phone camera.  The dog shampoo had not arrived yet so I used plain unscented dawn dish soap to get the worst dirt off and then human moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  The problem happened before I applied the new dog specific after bath coat conditioner for helping her excess fluff slide out and that was a spray I didn't really get on myself so everything I used was the same as I have repeatedly in other situations.  \n\n\nInitially I thought the flexible plastic brush with it's hand strap and finger loop were merely pushing the bulky ring into my finger.  I have very small hands and this is the widest and sharpest edged ring I've ever worn.  So I assumed despite trying to keep my finger farther back and avoid pushing on the ring the occasional times it did were the reason for the mild discomfort and red line on the back of my finger.  \n\n\nThe next morning that red line was a huge raised red welt in a strip as wide a the ring with larger areas that matched the spacing of the electrodes.  I decided it was most definitely not just from the ring digging in.  I moved my ring to my other hand.  It's continued to work as normal.  By evening I had 3 large blisters that broke and scabbed over.  While those healed during the next several days little itchy blisters appeared along the edges of the still large raised red welt across the back of my finger.  I heal fast so it was slightly concerning that this wound showed practically no sign of improving.  \n\n\nFinally over a week later new blisters stopped forming, the raised area suddenly went down practically overnight, and the damaged skin is peeling off.  I've always had a tendency to find ways to burn myself while cooking, fireworks(even sparklers), and once I melted some fine copper wire strands to the side of my finger in a rewiring oopsy on a low voltage device.  I'm pretty sure I have never managed to get a burn this severe.    \n\n\nUnfortunately I can't really tell you what the catalyst was given I've used all the same products in other situations and rinsed each one off thoroughly before the next.  The only unique thing in this incident was dog fur.  Doing dishes for hours, taking long showers with soaps, scrubbing the dogs with dry shampoo spray or wipes, wiping off the kitchen counters with mild chlorine based disinfectant (not at all similar to bleach), dusting with pledge, and mopping the floor with an oura ring on has not resulted in any problems.    \n\n\nMaybe soap covered dog fur can short out an oura ring?  Don't know but of all the things you do while wearing an oura ring apparently don't wash the dog. :P   \n\n\n  \n\n\nShampoo and conditioner used:  \n OGX coconut milk nourishing shampoo- Active Ingredients: Aqua (Water); Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate;  Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine; Parfum; Glycol  Distearate; Dimethicone Copolyol; Cetyl Alcohol; Cocamide DEA; Guar  Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; Polyquaternium-11; DMDM Hydantoin;  Panthenol; Silk Amino Acids; Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract; Albumen;  Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil; Hydrolyzed Milk Protein; Tocopheryl  Acetate (Vitamin E); Coumarin \n\n&#x200B;\n\nogx coconut milk conditioner- Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride,  Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit  Extract, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl  Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Citric Acid,  Cyclopentasiloxane, Panthenol, Ovum (Egg Powder), Propylene Glycol,  Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone, Fragrance (Parfum).",

Sometimes I like to flat iron my hair so make it straighter, sometimes I use a curling iron to add more waves. \n\nThe conditioner I was looking at is Garnier [Whole Blends Repairing Conditioner](https://www.garnierusa.com/about-our-brands/whole-blends/honey-treasures-repairing/repairing-conditioner-honey-treasures). The fourth ingredient is amodimethicone (following water, cetearyl alcohol, and behentrimonium chloride). I'd use it with a shampoo containing cocamidopropyl betaine. I saw a gentle shampoo from Cantu that looks like it could work really well, but for some reason the listed ingredients differ between websites. \n\nWould this conditioner work as a substitute for heat protectant spray? What if I were to use it as a leave-in? (This might be too heavy for my hair though). I'm not a huge fan of sprays because the spray usually gets on my face and can cause breakouts, and it's hard to get even coverage. I would love to find a conditioner or leave in with water-soluble silicones to replace heat protectant spray, but finding any product (conditioners, sprays, leave-ins, you name it) that has water-soluble silicones *only*, and *high up in the ingredient list* has been nearly impossible... So I've kind of given up on that. \n\nEDIT: I did find this leave-in that supposedly only contains water-soluble silicones - [Bed Head Control Freak Serum](https://www.ulta.com/bed-head-control-freak-serum?productId=xlsImpprod4750119) - but it's a little pricey, and I also don't know if the water-soluble silicones are strong enough or high enough in the ingredient list to offer adequate heat protection.

The products are advertised for dry hair and contain ingredients such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate, typically used as humectants in skincare.\n\nMy understanding of glycerin and sodium hyaluronate is that they are water-based ingredients, so I was sceptical if this is just marketing and if they'd do anything meaningful or simply be washed out.\n\nThe formula does include silicones, so perhaps the active ingredients could be trapped underneath that, but on the other hand, perhaps the silicones would be stopping them from penetrating the hair? (I'm not sure if the glycerol or hyaluronate are the right molecular size to enter the hair shaft in the first place.)\n\nSuppose they could bypass the cuticle would they provide any benefit?\n\nI've been looking at diagrams of hair anatomy and can't tell if dry healthy hair is meant to contain a certain amount of water. Assuming it is, and that a damaged cuticle leads to a reduction of this as water is escaping, leaving hair feeling \"dry\", would such ingredients be able to increase the water content in hair?\n\nIf so, is there such a thing as too much water, where this could help damaged hair, but make healthy hair limp or fragile? \n\n\"Dry\" hair is fragile too, ie. inflexible and prone to snapping, but it's not clear if increasing water content can alleviate this if oils and silicones haven't been enough.\n\nMy understanding of humectants in skincare is that they work by either drawing in water from the air or pulling it up from the skin surface, but neither of those seem to apply here, so are hair humectants doing anything, particularly when used with silicones? Would it maybe make sense to apply silicones afterwards?\n\nThe hair range also includes a leave-in product with a lot more hyaluronate, and oil instead of silicone, but I don't know about penetration when it comes to applying this on dry hair (presumably on a layer of silicones from the conditioner).\n\nI'd love if someone could weigh in on the science here.\n\n--\n\nList of the ingredients in this range for reference:\n\nShampoo:  \nAQUA / WATER¬†‚Ä¢¬†SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE¬†‚Ä¢¬†GLYCOL DISTEARATE¬†‚Ä¢¬†SODIUM CHLORIDE¬†‚Ä¢¬†COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE¬†‚Ä¢¬†DIMETHICONE¬†‚Ä¢ CI 60730 / EXT.

HYA and glycerin won‚Äôt remain on your hair when washed out, but in a conditioner, they may linger a bit, as most conditioners leave behind a film by design.  It is good to have humectants in a formulation for many reasons.  But not every ingredient in a formulation is going to perform independently as it would if you were using separately.  In other words, in a formulation it does one thing, while if you were put a HYA serum directly on your hair, it would do something else (or have a different effect rather).  \n\nFwiw, you can always a drop or two of HYA or glycerin to your leave-in conditioner if you want more humectants in your hair.",

        "body": "The relationship between hair and water is complicated.  When most people talk about \"moisturizing\" or \"hydrating\" their hair, they're really talking about the benefits of using conditioner, which mostly forms a coating of conditioning agents on the hair that make it softer and smoother rather than adding water.  It's a mis-application of skincare concepts to hair.  Hair is quite different from skin.  If there's too much water in the hair, it actually feels more dry, which is what the moisture bot that this comment will trigger says.  Porous hair, especially if there is chemical or heat or sun or chlorine damage, will usually allow too much water into the hair shaft, so conditioners offer the benefit of decreasing (but not completely blocking) the amount of water that passes through.\n\nHowever there has been a bit of an overcorrection of this idea in some hair science circles to give the impression that hair doesn't benefit from any water at all, and that's not true either.  [This video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1qFlgNSgLp/) is information-dense and just scratches the surface of the topic, and I wish I had additional resources to share but that's all I've found that's made for a general audience.\n\nIn your situation, your hair feels dry (rough/brittle) to you, so it may actually have too much water in it and would benefit from products with oils, silicones and other polymers that help reduce water passing through.  L'Oreal has a big budget for product development and testing, so I trust that their products are good for the hair type they say they are, but exactly how & why may not match what the label says, that's just marketing that is aimed to appeal to customer's *perceptions*, not reflect scientific reality.  It could be the silicones in the product and other ingredients you're not familiar with that offer a lot of the benefits that the product promises.  You might find some of the [LabMuffin Beauty articles/videos on silicones](https://labmuffin.com/?s=silicones) useful, it's important to understand that they don't create an impermeable barrier on the hair to block anything from getting through.\n\nI share the skepticism of the other commenter that humectants in a shampoo would do much for hair, since it's meant to remove stuff from the hair and then is rinsed out.  Conditioners are formulated to stick to the hair, however it's still very possible that the hyaluronic acid is featured mainly for marketing purposes.  There has been a recent fad in marketing to highlight skincare actives in the products, but hair and skin are very different and those actives don't necessarily behave the same way for hair or help hair at all.  Glycerin may be useful if the product leaves it on the hair, but people's experiences with glycerin in hair products vary wildly, because it depends a lot on your local climate and the humidity level of the air around your hair.  It's also possible that glycerin was added to the product to change the product consistency rather than its effect on the hair, or simply because people *associate* it with moisture/hydration even though that's not the role it plays in the product.",

I want to understand why so I can avoid that happening again when I get new CG approved products.\n\nShampoo disaster- In August 2019 I unintentionally tried a CG approved shampoo according to isitcg: Soapbox Coconut Oil Shampoo (see ingredients  below). The first two times were okay, but every time since then my hair has a terrible reaction. It makes my hair ridiculously tangled and matted, almost gummy? Yet simultaneously dry as straw at the bottom? No amount of conditioner helps. It makes it terribly difficult to brush/comb and consequently I lose a bunch of hair. \n\nWhy might this have happened? It is very confusing and makes me very nervous to switch to a CG shampoo, despite the non-CG one I am currently using causing some other smaller issues.  \n\nSomeone else suggested maybe my hair doesn‚Äôt like coconut oil, but I‚Äôve always used products with it since 2012. They also said it sounds like protein overload, which it does sound like that, but the Soapbox shampoo does not have protein as far as I can tell...?  \n\nFor context, I think I have 2A-2B wavy hair that has low porosity at the top and maybe medium at the bottom. I have very thick, fine hair that gets very frizzy in humidity. Where I live has 90% humidity most of the time. It basically doesn‚Äôt grow beyond my shoulders and just breaks off. It‚Äôs very prone to oil and grease at the top, but always dry at the bottom. Products cause nasty build up at the top, and sometimes are absorbed a little at the bottom and it is gross. It takes at least 2.5 hours to air dry, usually closer to 4. I live in a mostly hot, very humid climate. CG approved shampoo I unintentionally used in the past had a lot of protein and glycerin in it. Sometimes glycerin was the second ingredient.\n\n\nSoapbox Coconut Shampoo Ingredients:\n\nWater (Aqua), Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Glycerin, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Panthenol, Polyquaternium-11, Polyquaternium-7, Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Juice, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Sodium Chloride, Citric Acid, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzyl Alcohol",

    "body": "Hi curlies! \n\nI've been playing around with the CG method for the last few weeks and I'm loving it. I'm aiming to be low-poo for the time being, as I am a bit of a shampoo addict. Microfibre towel and wide toothed comb have changed my life though, as has Lush's 'R'n'B' hair moisturiser.\n\nA number of forums and websites have recommended Organix Renewing Argan Oil Shampoo (OGX in the UK) as being CG-friendly. I've been using it followed by a no-cone conditioner (Superdrug extracts) and enjoying the results but I'm still unsure if it is truly suitable for a low-poo approach? Does anyone have any thoughts on this? \n\nI know some sulfates are less problematic than others and the one that sticks out on the ingredients list is Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfate. Full ingredients posted below. Any advice appreciated!\n\nAqua (Water)\nDisodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate\nSodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate\nCocamidopropyl Betaine\nCocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine\nDimethicone Copolyol\nCocamide DEA\nGlycol Distearate\nArgania Spinoza (Argan) Kernel Oil\nTheobroma Cacao (Cocoa Butter) Extract\nParfum\nCocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\nPersea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil\nAloe Barbadensis (Aloe) Leaf Extract\nPanthenol\nPolyquaternium-11\nCetyl Alcohol\nGuar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride\nPEG-23M\nDMDM Hydantoin\nCI 16035 (Red 40)\nCI 19140 (Yellow 5)\nBenzyl Benzoate\nLimonene\nLinalool\n",

So I'm upset it didn't work for me. \n\nThe next day my hair was a dry ratty mess. It was so frizzy, tangled, and knotty. And detangling in the shower with conditioner was just awful, I could barely get the brush through it even with lots of conditioner. I was trying not to rip my hair out. My hair felt terrible. \n\nMy hair is fine and high porosity because it's been balayaged, so the roots are virgin but the lengths are blonde. \n\nI really want this product to work for me!  One thing I will note is that I did not shampoo it out with a clarifying shampoo, I used the Curlsmith purple protein one (can't remember the name). Maybe that was not cleansing enough to get the gel out? I tried using the gel with the Curlsmith protein curl cream, then tried again with the weightless leave in air dry cream. \n\n  \nAny suggestions as to why this didn't work for my hair or how to make it work?
