I've shared about this at length in my post [\"Fungal-safe\" skincare: unscientific BS?](https://reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/s/IxvbUdN1jv) The TLDR of that post: there is no scientific proof showing that the ingredients excluded as not \"fungal-safe\"  actually cause problems for those with malassezia-related conditions. The concept of \"fungal-safe\" is something created purely based on the personal experiences of people on the internet. It is 100% anecdotal. I will no longer be perpetuating the concept of \"fungal-safe\" skincare, and all previous or future posts by me should not be considered advice, but merely recountings of my personal experience. **These are simply techniques and product choices that have worked for me, personally.**\n\n‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è\n\nIt's been over a year since I first made a list of fungal-safe products, for anyone dealing with malassezia follicutlitis (fungal acne), seb derm (seborrheic dermatitis) or similar conditions. Since then, more products have come on the market, reformulations have happened, I've used more products - plus I figured having just a list would be handy reference, since my first post was... really long üòÇ\n\n[My first list of fungal-safe products](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), with an in-depth guide to how I made my first fungal-safe skincare routine, and practical tips. Notable point is, since that post, I've learned that cetearyl alcohol is not fungal-safe, and switched to using https://folliculitisscout.com as an ingredient checker since I find it up to date, with that ingredient flagged. if any of you want to check if a product is fungal-safe - that's the website I personally use ‚ò∫Ô∏è If you want a detailed rundown of how and why these ingredients affect our skin, I highly reccomend the SimpleSkincareScience website - [Their Fungal Acne Treatment Bible post](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/) is very thorough and cites sources ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n[My current routine in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/uwmvkk/my_current_2022_fungalsafe_skincare_routine_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (more or less) with some haircare.\n\nThese are not recommendations, they're just useful information - some products have reviews linked, but please do use ‚ú®Ô∏èthe search bar‚ú®Ô∏è as well as other sources to check out other reviews, and make an informed purchase  ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n**Disclaimer:** These products are not guaranteed to suit anybody. It's just that ingredients that are known triggers for seb derm or fungal acne - like plant oils, esters, fatty acids, etc. - are absent in these products. They may not suit your skin for other reasons. YMMV.\n\n**They will not treat malassezia related conditions**, they're intended as options for those who want to use a fungal-safe routine, to prevent flare-ups and maintain their skin.\n\nIF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MAY BE SUFFERING FROM ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL GUIDANCE FROM A DERMATOLOGIST. These products are not a substitute for medical treatment.\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è First cleansers/makeup removers\n\n+ Solimo Micellar Water\n\n+ Garnier Naturals Micellar Water (the pink one)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil (plain pink original formula - does not emulsify, but can be used to dissolve and wipe off sunscreen/makeup, and followed up with a foaming cleanser)\n\n#‚ú®Ô∏è Foaming cleansers\n\n+ Sebamed Clear Face Cleansing Foam\n\n+ Simple Kind to Skin Refreshing Face Wash\n\n+ Kaya Clinic Soothing Cleansing Gel\n\n+ Deconstruct Niacinamide Brightening Face Wash - 2% Niacinamide+2% Liquorice Root Extract\n\n+ Deconstruct Salicylic Acid Oil Control Face Wash - 0.5% Salicylic Acid +1% Niacinamide [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/y3ynhi/review_deconstruct_salicylic_acid_oil_control/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=2&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Deconstruct Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Wash - 0.5% Amino Acids + 0.1% Hyaluronic Acid\n\n+ Body Cupid Deep Clarifying Face Wash (with Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E) \n\n+ Body Cupid Tea Tree and Neem Anti Acne Face Wash (with Tea Tree Oil & Neem Extract) \n\n+ Body Cupid Vitamin C Brightening Face Wash (with Fruit Extract of Kakadu Plums) \n\nAll the Body Cupid face washes appear to be fungal-safe, but the ones I left out have \"menthol crystals\" and \"strawberry microbeads\" in, respectively, so... wouldn't recommend, even in theory ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n+ Bliscent Lychee & Sea Buckthorn Face Wash\n\n+ Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash (tube, not foaming pump)\n\n+ Himalaya Tan Removal Orange Face Wash (not the scrub)\n\n+ DermaCo 2% Cica-Glow Daily Face Wash with Tranexamic Acid & Licorice Extract (contains something called \"Gillet-C\", which I cannot find as an ingredient anywhere, but seems to have something to do with vitamin C?)\n\n+ Mamaearth Charcoal Face Wash (with activated charcoal and coffee)\n\n+ Clean & Clear Natural Bright Face Wash\n\n+ Re'equil Fruit AHA Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/ibff5e/fungal_safe_products_and_routine/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Rejusure 2% Salicylic Acid Face Wash [(my review here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianSkincareAddicts/comments/th4u4s/review_rejusure_2_salicylic_acid_face_wash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n+ Zitclin Zitcare Foam Face Wash (2% salicylic acid in a \"gel base q.s. containing aloe vera\".

Sugarcane squalane is considered fungal-safe. Olive squalane is variable - some people with malassezia use it with zero issues, some find it aggravates their condition. I've mentioned the source of the squalane in these products whenever I've been able to find that info.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you are dealing with active seb derm/fungal acne and want to be on the safe side, best to avoid products containing mineral oil, liquid paraffin or Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather - even too much MCT oil - can lead to oil and heat building up and cause flare-ups. Less is more.\n\n+ Body Cupid 99% Pure Aloe Vera Gel (OG Aloe gel for me.

People have asked me how I choose one, and having looked at the available brands on Amazon, I can say that the brands Sharrets, Carbamide Forte and Growfit appear to be C8+C10 only, so they're suitable. \n\nThe brands Laurin and Kayos, for example, also contain C12, which is lauric acid - NOT fungal-safe. The brand Simyl is available in chemists and very cheap, but it's meant to be a weight gain supplement for infants, and is not fungal-safe. That's about all there is to look out for when purchasing, the rest is trial, even for me ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n+ Aiwo MCT C8 Oil (unfortunately the only C8 oil I can find, only available  in a 500ml bottle for around 2000 bucks)\n\n+ Johnson's Baby Oil with Vitamin E (the original, plain one) - just mineral oil with vitamin E and added fragrance\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Mineral oil is considered \"mostly\" safe, but apparently [can lead to growth of malssezia, albeit very slowly](https://simpleskincarescience.com/pityrosporum-folliculitis-treatment-malassezia-cure/#2Mineral_Oil). If you want to be on the safe side, best to avoid mineral oil, liquid paraffin and Vaseline/white petroleum altogether. Using anything heavy in humid/hot weather, even too much MCT oil, can lead to oil and heat building and cause flare-ups. Less is more, and if using mineral oil, a literal drop or two may be enough.\n\n+ Plain mineral oil/liquid paraffin - available at chemists. Not sure if it's less refined than the baby oil, but it's far cheaper (as it should be baby products are marked up like crazy) and has no fragrance\n\n+ Boroline/Boroline Night Repair Cream (waterless balm - same ingredients list, contains lanolin - not vegan - which may not suit some people's skin)\n\n+ Good old plain Vaseline \n\n+ Minimalist 100% Squalane (olive squalane, which works for some people with fungal issues and breaks some people out üôÉ)\n\n+ Indulgeo Quench ‚Äì 100% Sugarcane Squalane\n\n+ Indulgeo Squalane (70% olive, 30% sugarcane)\n\n+ PURITO Plainet Squalane Oil (sugarcane squalane, which is fungal-safe for sure. Will definitely be purchasing this myself, thank you u/imnumo!)\n\n+ The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane [Edit: may be derived from different sources in different locations, will update if I find out details.

    "body": "I‚Äôm about to drop a lot of information here, but please read! I learned a lot about how to properly use sulfates and silicones, so I want to share!! \n\nSo here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from Sarah Tran, who has thigh length hair. \n\nEdit: People have brought up genetics. Of course genetics is a huge factor in hair length, but the point of this post is to maintain *healthy* hair, so that it will grow with minimal breakage and split ends. I bring up her length because it is *healthy* as well as long. \n\nAlso note: silicones and sulfates won‚Äôt directly contribute to hair growth, but will make your hair stronger and less likely to break and fall out, indirectly resulting in longer fuller hair\n\nFirst off, silicones and sulfates are NOT bad. In fact, if she didn‚Äôt use silicones, she couldn‚Äôt protect her hair and have such long hair without split ends. The way most people USE silicones is bad though. \n\nThink about it like this: If you have a pair of high heels that are comfortable and you love them, but your friend asks you to go jogging, the shoes are not the problem, the *use* is.\n\nSilicones do the following: \n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair which makes it easier to detangle \n\n-Provides UV protection\n\n-Seals in moisture to prevent dryness\n\n-Makes hair look shiny\n\n-Reduces frizz and adds definition to curls\n\n-Softens and smooths cuticle\n\nSilicones do all these amazing things!!!! However, there are 4 types: airy, friendly (easy to wash out), resilient, and NO GO silicones\n\n*\n#Airy silicones: \nThese evaporate out of the hair after 10 minutes to a few hours. These do not have any negative effect on hair:\n\n-Cyclomethicone \n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n*\n#Friendly silicones:\nThese wash out of the hair with sulfate free shampoos:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone) \n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate) \n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n*\n#Resilient Silicones:\nThese do NOT build up on the strand, but are non soluble and *require a sulfate* to remove:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then No-Go Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone -Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient) \n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n*\n#NO GO Silicones:\nThese require multiple washes with sulfate shampoo to remove.

Get a good sulfate free shampoo\n\n2. Get a good shampoo that HAS sulfates\n\n3. Use airy and friendly silicones ALL the time\n\n4. Use resilient silicones once or twice a month. This will protect your hair more than friendly silicones. Resilient silicones must be washed out with a SULFATE shampoo at the max FIVE DAYS AFTER APPLICATION\n\n*\n#And one last thing!!!

        "body": "Hi! Guys please do your research and don't trust everything you hear. Having thigh length hair is a great achievement but it doesn't make someone a science expert, so posting this on a science sub is so misleading. \n\nI'm seeing some red flags. First off, no scientific sources. Second, commonly demonized ingredients in the push for \"clean\" beauty are again demonized here without proper given cause. And third, there are a few things that stuck out to me as glaringly false from what research I've done. Lastly, fourth, the phrasing at all of \"no go silicones\" and just the incorrect categorization of silicones that assigns them value (better to look at the truer category names: volatile, amine-modified, etc.)\n\nMost ingredients on that \"blacklist\" have little or absolutely no evidence of being bad. \n\nAnd the thing that strikes me as absolutely false is the list of cationic surfactabts as static causing, when most research and literature says the exact opposite - that they're anti static ingredients. Give me a minute and I'll add a few sources for the anti-static claim for cationic surfactants.\n\n> The widely used cationic surfactant docosyltrimethylammonium chloride was overall well performing, especially when it came to reduction of friction force and reduction of flyaway hair during combing. It was superior to the other cationic surfactant tested regarding reduction of frizz. This study suggests that the silicones and protein derivatives showed less promising results regarding the overall manageability. Preliminary data has implications that the efficiency of anti-frizz is correlated with cationic charge and high hydrophobicity of the conditioning agent. \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DYduaceeTnvMJ \n\n> Behentrimonium¬†chloride¬†and Cetrimonium¬†chloride¬†are known to be very effective hair conditioners with detangling,¬†anti-frizz, and¬†anti-static¬† \n\nhttps://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=behentrimonium+chloride+anti+static&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3D0FbAuscGO8AJ",

No product will ever make my shoulder blade-length hair thigh-length, and have it be healthy (as much as I would love that).

    "body": "**Background**  \n\nIn August my favorite shampoo, Hask Argan Oil Repairing Shampoo, got reformulated with ingredients I'm allergic to, so I decided it was high time to try out some AB shampoos.  One of the things I really liked about the Hask shampoo was that it cleansed thoroughly but gently, so I knew I wanted a shampoo that shared some (if not all) of the same surfactants as they can make a huge difference in the harshness of the shampoo.  I also wanted a sulfate/silicone free shampoo that had a few oils like the Hask shampoo as well.  After many nights scouring cosdna for ingredients lists, I settled on Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo.  \n\n**Product Claims/Ingredients**  \n\nMoist Diane's [website](http://www.moist-diane.jp/en/products/extra-damage.html) claims the purpose of this line is to \"restore extremely damaged hair ends and roughness\", as well as repairing hair damage when heat is applied due to the line's unique \"nano repair matrix\".  I don't heat treat my hair, nor is it permed, bleached, etc so I wasn't really drawn in by these claims. \n\nMy main draw was the [ingredients list](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_63e4326873.html):\n\n>Water, **Olefin (C14-16) sodium sulphonate**, **Cocamidopropyl betaine**, **Cocamidomethyl MEA**, Cocoyl glutamic acid TEA, Potassium cocoyl hydrolyzed keratin, PEG-7 glyceryl cocoate, Myristamine oxide, Sodium cocoamphoacetate, Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, Gamma-docosalactone, Quaternium-18, Quaternium-33, **Cholesterol**, **Ceramide EOP**, **Ceramide NG**, **Ceramide NP**, **Ceramide AG**, **Ceramide AP**, Propylene glycol, Hydrolyzed keratin, **Argania spinosa kernel oil**, Mango seed oil, Theobroma grandiflorum seed butter, Prune seed extract, Carapa guaianensis seed oil, Sclerocarya birrea seed oil, **Baobab seed oil**, Opuntia Ficus-Indica seed oil, Steardimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed keratin, Pouteria sapota seed oil, Keratin, Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin, Alanine, Hydroxyproline, Sodium-PCA, Cetearamidoethyl diethonium hydrolyzed rice protein, **Sodium Hyaluronate**, Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate, **Hydrolyzed hyaluronate**, **Hydrolyzed honey protein**, Malus domestica fruit cell culture extract, Argania spinosa sprout cell extract, Rhododendron ferrugineum leaf cell culture extract, **Collagen**, Hydrolyzed conchiolin, Bis-ethoxydiglycol cyclohexane 1,4-dicarboxylate, Propanediol, Dipropylene glycol, Butylene glycol, Isomalt, Polyquaternium-10, Isononyl isononanoate, Soybean sterols, Sodium chloride, Xanthan gum, Lecithin, Behentrimonium chloride, Glycerin, Citric acid, **Lactic acid**, Tocopherol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Aroma, Caramel \n\nBold indicates ingredients that my face likes or surfactants that are the same (or very similar) to the Hask shampoo.  Wow.  Five ceramides plus cholesterol, some nice oils (including baobab!!!), and some HA and collagen thrown in?  Yeah.  I like it.  \n\n**Performance**\n\nThis shampoo is a dream.  It lathers richly, which feels great, and it also has a mild fragrance (generic bubble bath scent) that is noticeable while using it but fades very quickly.  It comes in a large pump bottle, which is genius for shampoo and so much easier than fiddling with a squeeze tube.\n\nI have a naturally oily scalp that needs daily washing.  My scalp gets flaky if I use a shampoo that's too harsh, or if it gets super dry in the winter.  I've had no problems with flakiness since starting this shampoo and my scalp overall feels more hydrated and strong.  My hair also feels stronger and is glossier than it has been in a while.  I used to use Hask's argan oil hair mask 2-3x weekly, but I haven't felt the need to do so since starting this shampoo. \n\nI've also used this as a body wash since I ran out a month ago and thought why not share the goodness of this shampoo with all of my body skin. My skin is hydrated and appreciates the extra pampering.  \n\nFor curiosity's sake, I tested the pH with my aquarium drop test kit.  It's a narrow range test kit so it only shows 6.0 to 7.5, with anything below or above those values showing as a 6 or 7.5 respectively.  However, I'm not going to use anything above a 6.5 so it works for my purposes.  Moist Diane Perfect Beauty Extra Damage Repair Shampoo comes in at a 6.0 or below, which is awesome so I'm considering testing it on my face because YOLO.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nI have been using this shampoo daily since September and I will continue using it for my hair and body until they reformulate it or discontinue it. **HG**\n\n**Where to find it**\n\nI bought mine off Amazon prime for $15, although it's no longer available on Prime.  You can also find it and the refill pouches for a similar price on Ebay or Amazon Japan. Edit: and Dokodemo",

    "body": "Hey there! So I have extremely damaged hair that is breaking off every time I brush it (got a straight perm when my hair was bleached). In an effort to save my hair, I have learned so much about hair care through research and hair care classes and I wanted to share all the information I‚Äôve gathered!\n\n#Understanding Ingredients in Hair Care:\n\n##Surfactants:\nSurfactants are the main cleansing agents in shampoos. They often end in -ate or ‚Äúglucoside‚Äù.\n\nFor example, potassium cocoate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sulfates, decyl glucoside, etc.\n\n##Cationic ingredients:\nCationic ingredients are anti-static for the hair. They are the main component of conditioners. They reduce static and are conditioning to the hair. They often end in -entrimonium chloride, -quaternium, or ‚Äúmethosulfate‚Äù (note: if an ingredient says methosulfate after a word, it is an **anti-static** NOT a sulfate).\nAnti-static ingredient examples: Behentrimonium chloride, Cetrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-17, quaternium-22, Behentrimonium methosulfate, etc.\n\n##Ingredients to use with caution:\n**Note: this is NOT a list of ingredients to avoid, but to rather use with caution.**\n\nThat being said, there are some ingredients which I do try to avoid, such as formaldehyde releasing preservatives (Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate, DMDM Hydantoin, and Diazolidinyl Urea).\n\nCocomidopropyl betaine impurities may cause scalp irritation: https://www.healthline.com/health/cocamidopropyl-betaine#how-to-avoid\n\nCoco-Betaine to be used with caution (pg.6-12): https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/alkbet032014final_0.pdf\n\nCocomide DEA and cancer: https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/cocamide-diethanolamine-cocamide-dea-coconut-oil-diethanolamine-condensate\n\nSoyamide DEA irritates unless formulated to be non irritating (21): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1091581813486300\n\nIsopropyl alcohol or SD alcohol (Volatile alcohols drying in high concentrations): https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/good-alcohols-vs-bad-alcohols\n\nWitch hazel can be drying: https://www.healthline.com/health/witch-hazel-for-hair#safety\n\nTriclosan not recognized as generally safe by FDA: https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-triclosan\n\nTriethanolamine toxicity: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/706639-TRIETHANOLAMINE-TRIETHANOLAMINE/\n\nPVP/VA mild skin irritation (15-16): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/10915818309140719\n\nIsopropyl palmitate mild skin irritation: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Isopropyl-palmitate#section=EPA-Safer-Chemical\n\nQuaternium-15 formaldehyde releasing: https://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/quaternium-15/\n\nIodopropynyl butylcarbamate only safe in low concentrations: https://www.cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/butylcarbamate_rr.pdf\n\nDMDM Hydantoin and formaldehyde: https://www.chemscape.com/blog/DMDM-hydantoin-shampoo\n(This is the ingredient that OGX got sued over)\n\nDiazolidinyl Urea and formaldehyde: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/701923-DIAZOLIDINYL_UREA/\n\nPolyvinyl acetate insufficient evidence of safety in cosmetic products: https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/705158-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE-POLYVINYL_ACETATE/\n\n#How to use Silicones and Sulfates Properly:\n\nSilicones are great, as they do the following for hair:\n\n-Coat and lubricate the hair shaft, making hair easier to brush and detangle\n\n-Great heat and UV protectant\n\n-Seals in moisture, prevents dryness\n\n-Gives hair a shiny appearance\n\n-Softens and smooths the cuticle\n\n##Silicones to use only if using a strong sulfate shampoo regularly:\n\nThese are very difficult to wash out of hair, even with a sulfate surfactant:\n\n-Behenoxy dimethicone\n\n-Bis-Phenylpropyl Dimethicone\n\n-Cetearyl methicone\n\n-Cetyl dimethicone\n\n-Dimethiconol hydroxystearate \n\n-Polysilicone-18\n\n-Cetyl Phosphate\n\n-Propyl Dimethicone\n\n-Stearoxy dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl dimethicone\n\n-Stearyl methicone \n\n-Trimethylsiloxyamodimethicone -Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n##Volatile silicones:\nThese evaporate after 10 minutes to a few hours after application. (Volatile just means they evaporate quickly):\n\n-Cyclomethicone\n\n-Cyclo-....-siloxane ingredients \n\n-Decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane \n\n-Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane \n\n-Hexamethyldisiloxane \n\n-Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane\n\n##Easy to remove silicones:\nThese condition the hair, provide UV protection, and wash out with sulfate free surfactants:\n\n-Dimethicone\n\n-Dimethicone copolyol\n\n-Dimethiconol\n\n-Diphenyl Dimethicone\n\n-Disiloxane\n\n-Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane\n\n-Lauryl methicone copolyol\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then Resilient Silicone)\n\n-Phenyltrimethicone\n\n-Silica\n\n-Silicone resin\n\n-Siloxysilicates\n(i.e. ingredients that end with the word Siloxysilicate)\n\n-Silsequioxanes\n\n-Trisiloxane\n\n##Resilient silicones:\nThese silicones can be removed with a sulfate AND some sulfate-free surfactants:\n\n-Aminopropyl Dimethicone\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane\n(unless in the presence of a cationic ingredient then very resilient Silicone)\n\n-Amodimethicone\n\n-Anything ending in -dimethylsiloxane\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Bis-aminopropyl Dimethicone \n\n-Dimethicone crosspolymer\n\n-Methicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Dimethicone with PEG/PPG in the name\n(only in the presence of a cationic ingredient)\n\n-Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer\n\n##Cationic ingredients List:\n(Anti-static ingredients)\nThese ingredients usually end in ‚Äú-imonium chloride‚Äù. These are in basically every conditioner to reduce static in hair:\n\n-Behentrimonium chloride\n\n-Behentrimonium methosulfate (this is NOT a sulfate, it‚Äôs an anti-static)\n\n-Cetrimonium chloride\n\n-Cetrimonium bromide\n\n-Cinnamidopropyltrimonium chloride\n\n-Cocotrimonium chloride\n\n-Dicetyldimonium chloride\n\n-Dicocodimonium chloride\n\n-Hydrogenated Palm Trimethylammonium chloride\n\n-Isostearamidopropyl dimethylamine\n\n-Polyquaternium-xx\n\n-Quaternium-22\n\n-Stearalkonium chloride\n\n-Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine (lactate, citrate, propionate)\n\n#Sulfates:\n\n##Mild Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are best used to remove volatile and easy to remove silicones. They can only remove resilient silicones with multiple washes, unless paired with many different sulfate free surfactants (a shampoo that has 3-4 or these in their ingredients list):\n\n-Decyl Glucoside\n\n-Coco Glucoside\n\n-Lauryl Glucoside\n\n-Sodium Cocoate\n\n-Potassium Cocoate\n\n##Sulfate free surfactants that can remove resilient silicones:\n\nThese can remove resilient silicones, but not on their own, so usually a shampoo will use a combination of 2-3 of these:\n\n-Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfoacetate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl Sarcosinate\n\n-Sodium lauroyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium cocoyl glutamate\n\n-Sodium methyl cocoyl taurate\n\n-Disodium laureth sulfosuccinate\n\n##High Strength Sulfate-Free Surfactants:\n\nThese are technically sulfate free, but they are **just** as thoroughly cleansing as sulfates, so they can still strip hair dye. Best used for removing resilient silicones\n\n-C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium C14-16 Olefin sulfonate\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n##Sulfates that remove resilient silicones:\n\nStrong sulfates are best used to remove resilient silicones. Do not use if you have colored hair, as it will fade your color\n\n-Ammonium laureth sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Ammonium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-TEA lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium lauryl sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium Myreth Sulfate (Strong)\n\n-Sodium carboxylate (soap)\n\n-Sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate\n\n-Lauryl hydroxysultaine\n\n-Sodium cocoamphoacetate\n\n-Sodium Lauroamphoacetate\n\n-Ethyl PEG-15 Cocamine Sulfate (Mild)\n\n-Sodium coco sulfate (Mild)\n\n#Understanding Protein in Hair:\n\nHair is made of protein, proteins are made of amino acids and peptides. Hair contains the following amino acids:\n\n-Cysteine\n\n-Serine\n\n-Proline\n\n-Glutamic Acid\n\n-Valine\n\n-Glycine\n\n-Threonine\n\n-Leucine\n\n-Arginine\n\n-Aspartic Acid\n\n-Isoleucine\n\n##Proteins in hair products have different sizes:\n\nThe smaller the size of the protein, the more it can penetrate past the cuticle. The larger the protein, the more it will fill in the gaps of damaged parts of the cuticle and form a protective film over the hair strand\n\n##Amino acids and peptides \nare the smallest and will agree with most hair types: fine, medium, coarse, low porosity, high porosity.\n\n##Hydrolyzed silk, keratin, and collagen \nwill also agree with most hair types as the sizes of these proteins are small to medium\n\n##Hydrolyzed wheat, oat, quinoa, corn, soy, lupine and other plant or vegetable proteins \nare medium to large in size and are best for porous hair, fine and medium hair, damaged hair, and chemically treated hair.\n\n##Gelatin \nis medium to large in size and is best used for very damaged and porous hair (look up diy Gelatin treatments)\n\nThe Aphogee 2 step protein treatment is also a gelatin treatment with other proteins as well and can help strengthen extremely damaged hair.\n\nNOTE: Most Other DIY protein treatments do not penetrate or do anything for the hair. For example, a DIY egg or yogurt hair mask will not do anything for hair because the proteins in them are too large and is not formulated to penetrate or form a film over the hair.\n\n##Amino acid content of different proteins:\n\nIt‚Äôs best to stick to proteins that have similar amino acid makeup to the makeup of hair:\n\nFor example, hydrolyzed collagen has the same amounts of proline and glycine to the natural makeup of hair, while silk has more glycine than natural hair and less serine than natural hair. So collagen is better for your hair, but silk and other proteins will still be beneficial.\n\n##Description for proteins:\n\n-Collagen is one of the few proteins to provide a lot of Proline, one of the more abundant amino acids in the cuticle - good for improving elasticity in hair that snaps and breaks easily and feels mushy when wet. It is a hydrating protein, small to medium size and substantive. Collagen amino acids are smaller still.\n\n-Gelatin is partly hydrolyzed collagen and therefore contains medium to large protein constituents and is both hydrating and film-forming.\n\n-Wheat provides abundant Cystine - but it is not necessarily the same Cystine as in hair. If it can function similarly to the cystine in hair, wheat protein is superb. Hydrolyzed wheat protein is fairly large and therefore more of a film-forming, porosity-filling protein.\n\n-Oat protein is both hydrating and conditioning and also film forming and porosity-filling. Some versions of hydrolyzed oats are engineered to be medium-sized, but you cannot always know if that is what is in your product.\n\n-Soy protein, although it is a medium-size protein, it may not have the hydrating power of the other proteins. It's amino acid complement is more abundant in amino acids which are not as abundant in human hair. Soy protein is a small-medium size for conditioning\n\n-Corn protein is often combined with other proteins. Corn protein has small-medium size for conditioning and hydrating.\n\n-Keratin is a small-to-medium protein so it has hydrating and conditioning potential and 6 amino acids naturally abundant in the cuticle of your hair\n\n-Silk protein is a smaller protein and mostly hydrating and conditioning\n\n##Protein Overload Myth:\n\nThere are no scientific studies that have tested using too much protein on hair. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that too much protein deposited on hair leads to breakage and dryness.\n\n**This myth seems to stem from protein products not containing enough *hydrating and conditioning* ingredients.**\n\nTo avoid the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of protein overload, make sure to use enough hydrating conditioners in addition to protein containing products because this ‚Äúprotein overload‚Äù is really just moisture deficiency.\n\n##Moisture:\n\nTo improve moisture to balance out protein in hair, use a sealant on towel dried hair. This just means putting a light weight oil on towel dried hair. I use the OGX coconut milk serum oil as my sealant:\n\nhttps://www.ulta.com/p/coconut-milk-anti-breakage-serum-xlsImpprod2960061\n\n##Protein Products:\n\n**-Hask Keratin Protein Deep Conditioning

Hydrolyzed collagen, hydrolyzed wheat protein (5th and 6th ingredient)\n\n##I‚Äôve included this product list more for myself because it is very hard to find products with varying protein types and sizes.\n\n##The above information about protein and sulfates was found on Science-y Hair Blog!\n\n#Ingredients for Scalp Health:\n\n##Aloe Vera Gel:\n\nAloe is a great natural scalp soother and also helps detangle the hair.\n\nIt is also a **humectant** which attracts water and hydrates the scalp and hair.\n\nThis is also great for helping dry scalp and dandruff, as shown in this study:\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/09546639909055904\n\n##Rosemary oil:\n\nRosemary promotes hair growth in follicles that are in the resting phase of the hair growth cycle.\n\nThis study found that Rosemary oil applied to the scalp was just as effective at promoting hair growth as minoxidil. (Rosemary oil diluted with another oil, not applied directly. Direct application could be irritating, as essential oils are very strong)\n\nThe study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/\n\n##Rosemary oil products:\n\nMielle Rosemary Scalp Oil:\n\nhttps://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-care/shop-by-product/hair-treatments/rosemary-mint-scalp-and-hair-strengthening-oil/SBS-001489.html\n\n#Hair Damage Prevention:\n\n##Water Damage:\n\nWhen hair is wet, it is very fragile. In addition to this, even just the cuticle of the hair swelling when it‚Äôs wet is damaging.\n\nIn order to reduce damage from the cuticle swelling, make sure that your wet to dry time is around 1 hour\n\nWet to dry time is the total amount of time your hair takes to go from wet to dry. This starts from the moment your hair gets wet in the shower\n\nWaiting for hair to dry naturally usually takes a few hours. To speed this up, use an extra absorbent towel such as a microfiber towel or use a blow dryer.\n\nTo drastically reduce heat damage from a blow dryer, hold the blow dryer at least 6 inches away from your hair and blow dry with continuous motion\n\nThis study shows that blow drying in this fashion is less damaging than air drying because the damage from the cuticle swelling is reduced:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229938/\n\n##Physical damage:\n\nOther factors that lead to hair damage are physical:\n\n**Brushing:**\n\nIn order to reduce damage from brushing, start brushing the very end of your hair and then work your way up.\n\n**Brush types:**\n\n-Wooden brushes help distribute oil in your hair. Most wooden brushes also have bristles that are far apart which reduce hair breakage due to the hair not getting snagged as easily with far apart bristles.\n\n-Brushes with flexible bristles are beneficial because they also reduce hair breakage due to hair not getting snagged as easily on them.\n\n-Boar bristle brushes also help distribute oil very well, but they have extremely close bristles, so these should only be used after fully detangling the hair with a more suitable detangling brush.\n\n#Friction Damage:\n\n**Sleep friction:**\nA lot of damage happens when you sleep due to your hair rubbing against your pillow.\nSleep on a silk or satin pillowcase or sleep in a silk or satin bonnet to greatly reduce this friction\nThis has made the biggest difference in my frizz and makes my hair so much easier to detangle in the morning!!! (I use a silk bonnet)\n\n**UV Damage:**\nUV rays damages hair significantly. Wear a hat or use hair UV protection (raspberry oil mixed with water is a great and cheap hair UV protectant)\n\n**Wind:**\nif you are planning on going outside for a prolonged period of time when it is windy, wear a protective hairstyle like a braid or a bun",

After having benefited so much from reading SkincareAddiction for the past year or so, I thought it was time I gave back to the community; here‚Äôs a looong review post of many of the products I‚Äôve used over the past year and a half (some not pictured). \n\n**First a couple of things about me:** I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, Fitzpatrick scale II, untanned so very pale, northern European. I have normal skin, it used to be a little dry (dry patches on upper cheek, etc.) and a little bit sensitive, and I have to occasional tiny pimple, but I think I can only describe it as normal at this point in time. I also have a lot of pores, though on the smaller side, some blackheads, and a little bit of redness in my skin (but that could be because my current paleness hides nothing). I don‚Äôt wear makeup on a daily ‚Äì or even weekly ‚Äì basis. I‚Äôve had a Visia scan, and turns out that I‚Äôm in the \\~50% when it comes to UV damage. \\*screams into the void\\* Which means that I‚Äôm average in terms of accumulation of permanent UV damage, for my skin tone and age, despite me never having purposely tanned since I was 14-15. FML. I‚Äôve been wearing various SPF products daily for the past year and a half (since the spring of 2018). \n\n**Onto the reviews!**\n\n**NAME:** NIVEA DOUBLE EFFECT EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Eye make-up remover.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Isododecane, Isopropyl Palmitate, Dimethicone, Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil, Centaurea Cyanus Flower Extract, Sodium Chloride, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Trisodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Benzethonium Chloride, CI 60725, CI 61565  **SIZE:** 125 ml  **REVIEW:** It does the job! When I do wear eye makeup every blue moon or so, I want to remove it with as little tugging and mess as possible, and this does just that. Shake the bottle thoroughly before use, apply it to a cotton pad, hold it over your closed eyes, wait, move the cotton pad back and forth gently‚Ä¶ boom all the makeup is off. Note: this is not a leave on product, so rinse with water and use a facial cleanser afterwards. Could be bad for sensitive skin. Never remove makeup while wearing contact lenses.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!    \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA/WATER, GLYCERIN, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, PHENOXYETHANOL, STEARYL ALCOHOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, PEG-40 STEARATE, BEHENTRIMONIUM METHOSULFATE, GLYCERYL STEARATE, POLYSORBATE 20, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, DISODIUM EDTA, DIPOTASSIUM PHOSPHATE, SODIUM LAUROYL LACTYLATE, CERAMIDE NP, CERAMIDE AP, PHYTOSPHINGOSINE, CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM HYALURONATE, XANTHAN GUM, CARBOMER, TOCOPHEROL, CERAMIDE EOP. F.I.L.  **SIZE:** 472 ml  **REVIEW:** I mean, it‚Äôs fine. This is many people‚Äôs holy grail (HG) cleanser, and I see why, kind of. It‚Äôs affordable, nice pump, doesn‚Äôt try out your skin, removes some makeup (not all, this is not a makeup remover), it removes sunscreen and grime, etc. I don‚Äôt love it personally because of the texture: clear gel. It is hydrating and gentle, but there are products that are even more so. It‚Äôs standing in my shower, and I use it occasionally. Suitable for sensitive skin. Not a leave on product, so rinse with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Meh, maybe?\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo-Cleanser **\\[**HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial cleanser.   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Dipropylene Glycol, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Capryl Glycol.  **SIZE:** 200 ml  **REVIEW:** This is my HG cleanser! I love it so much. It doesn‚Äôt remove all makeup, it‚Äôs as effective as the CeraVe I would say, but the texture is so nice. There are no surfactants, so you could technically leave it on. It has a watery white lotion texture ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt feel like a cleanser. It makes me look forward to cleaning my face every night! Suitable for sensitive skin. I rinse it off with lukewarm water.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! This is my second bottle already. \n\n**NAME:** Simple Kind to Skin Micellar Cleansing Water    **PRODUCT TYPE:** Micellar water, makeup remover, facial cleanser.  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Hexylene Glycol, Glycerin, Niacinamide, Panthenol, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Butylene Glycol, Pantolactone, Cetrimonium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Citric Acid, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate  **SIZE:** 400 ml   **REVIEW:** It works the same way as every other micellar water. It also has niacinamide and panthenol, which is beneficial to the skin. However, I don‚Äôt leave micellar water on, even though some sources says that‚Äôs fine, so I don‚Äôt know how beneficial those two actives are. It removes makeup beautifully, but I prefer removing makeup with the Nivea listed above. I use it daily: I apply a large amount to one cotton pad, run it over my skin, then cleanse with a facial cleanser. So a double cleanse of sorts. I think it‚Äôs important to rinse your face with water after using micellar water, so that you make sure the product not only has moved your old makeup and grime around your face. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup! It can, however, be replaced by another micellar water (they‚Äôre pretty similar).\n\n**NAME:** PAULA'S CHOICE CALM SOOTHING TONER (NORMAL TO DRY SKIN)  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Toner, essence (maybe)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin (hydration / skin replenishing), Cyclopentasiloxane (hydration), Glycereth-26 (emollient), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Genistein (antioxidant), Carnosine (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Epigallocatechin Gallate (antioxidant), Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract (skin-soothing), Boerhavia Diffusa Root Extract (antioxidant / skin-soothing), Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride (skin replenishing / emollient), Dimethiconol (hydration), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration / skin replenishing), Oleic Acid (skin replenishing), Linolenic Acid (skin replenishing), Palmitic Acid (skin replenishing), Linoleic Acid (skin replenishing), Phospholipids (skin replenishing), Epilobium Angustifolium (Willow Herb) Flower / Leaf / Stem Extract (skin-soothing), Polysorbate 20 (texture-enhancing), Hydrogenated Lecithin (skin replenishing), Acrylates / C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer (texture-enhancing), Xanthan Gum (texture-enhancing), Laureth-4 (texture-enhancing), Laureth-23 (texture-enhancing), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Disodium EDTA (stabilizer), Ethylhexylglycerin (preservative), Phenoxyethanol (preservative)  **SIZE:** 118 ml   **REVIEW:** Why did I buy this again? I mean, it‚Äôs a fine product, but no one really needs a toner. Having wet and hydrated skin can help other actives penetrate deeper, but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, for some reason. If it did, I might have liked it more, but then Paula‚Äôs Choice wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sell their Niacinamide serum, I guess. Little bit weird smell, sinks into the skin completely, never used it as a make-up remover, okay allantoin product. I don‚Äôt think I have anything more to say. Suitable for sensitive skin, leave on product.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NIOD Superoxide Dismutase Saccharide Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Antioxidant product, facial mist  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Superoxide Dismutase, Malachite Extract, Pseudoalteromonas Exopolysaccharides, Mirabilis Jalapa Extract, Polypodium Vulgare Rhizome Extract, Cetraria Islandica Thallus Extract, Sphagnum Magellanicum Extract, Arginine, Propanediol, Glycerin, Pentylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Salicylate, Gellan Gum, Sodium Chloride, PPG-26-Buteth-26, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Citric Acid, Tromethamine, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 240 ml  **REVIEW:** I bought it for the superoxide dismutase (SOD). It‚Äôs an antioxidant and enzyme that naturally occurs in our cells that are exposed to oxygen. It fights the superoxide radical, which is one of the most damaging radicals there is. Mice genetically altered to not produce SOD, die. We don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs very beneficial when applied topically to our skin, however. We just don‚Äôt have the data. I hope it is, though. I‚Äôm also worried that it‚Äôll denaturate if I apply a vitamin C serum afterwards, and stuff like that. How sensitive is this enzyme? The spay applicator sucks, so I just spray it into my hand and apply it onto my face. Water-like texture. I have not noticed a weird smell, but some people say they have. It really stings your eyes, so beware. Seriously. It‚Äôs one of my more pricier products, but it lasts a looong time‚Ä¶ And it says it expires in six months, so make sure you use it day and night! Probably suitable for sensitive skin, but always patch test.       **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure!\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Flash Defence Anti-Pollution Mist  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial mist, anti-pollution  **INGREDIENT LIST:** AQUA (WATER), UNDARIA PINNTIFIDA EXTRACT, PROPANEDIOL, CAPRYLYL/ CAPRYL GLUCOSIDE, HYDROLYZED CANDIDA SAITOANA EXTRACT, LACTIC ACID, PARFUM\\* (FRAGRANCE), POLYGLYCERYL5 OLEATE, SODIUM COCOYL GLUTAMATE, BIOSACCHARIDE GUM4, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, CITRIC ACID, PHENOXYETHANOL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FLOWER EXTRACT, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE, SODIUM BENZOATE, POTASSIUM SORBATE, ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN, BENZYL SALICYLATE, CITRONELLOL, LINALOOL \\*100% NATURAL FRAGRANCE PARFUM 100% NATUREL  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It was a gift. It says that it works as a shield against pollution by forming a biosaccharide barrier. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs impossible to test that as a consumer, unless, I apply to half of my face for the next ten years and do a side by side comparison. So, yeah. It contains perfume like most of REN‚Äôs products, so beware. Just because it says it‚Äôs natural fragrance, doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt mess with your skin. The word ‚Äúnatural‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a regulated term, and the most toxic molecules we‚Äôve found we‚Äôre all from mother nature herself: google Belcher's sea snake, for example. The citrus-like scent is pleasant, you can use it as a last step or on top of your makeup. Probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Watery texture, dries down completely. Nice applicator.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** No.\n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Niacinamide, Pentylene Glycol, Zinc PCA, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Tamarindus Indica Seed Gum, Xanthan gum, Isoceteth-20, Ethoxydiglycol, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** It‚Äôs a solid niacinamide serum. It gets the job done. The texture is kind of like spit, dare I say. A little bit tacky, so I wouldn‚Äôt use it during the daytime. I‚Äôm not currently using it, because I‚Äôm trying to use fewer products in my routine, and my skin doesn‚Äôt really need all that much niacinamide. Great for acne, hyperpigmentation, weak skin barrier, anti-aging. I don‚Äôt know if the zinc does anything, tbh. I think everything has already been said about every The Ordinary product, actually. Suitable for sensitive skin but do a patch test.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Granactive Retioid 2% Emulsion  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid, serum, emulsion  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycerin, Ethyl Linoleate, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethyl Isosorbide, Cetearyl Isononanoate, Bisabolol, Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate, Retinol, Tasmannia Lanceolata Fruit/Leaf Extract, Inulin Lauryl Carbamate, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth-12, Ceteareth-20, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carrageenan, Xanthan gum, Acacia Senegal Gum, Cetyl Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Polysorbate 20, Isoceteth-20, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Disodium EDTA, Dehydroacetic Acid, Benzoic Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** Hmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to feel about the ingredient: granactive retionoid (AKA Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate), because there is so little data about it. How does it measure up to good ol‚Äô retinol, or the gold standard: tretinoin? The manufacturer of granactive retiod hasn‚Äôt released their data to the public (last time I checked), so there is no way for me, a consumer, to know if it truly works, and how effectively. And since it takes months for retinoids to show results on your skin, it‚Äôs even more difficult for a single person to measure its effectiveness. So, I don‚Äôt know. I think I‚Äôll wait a while longer to see if there‚Äôs any new data and studies on second generation retinoids before I start using one again. The texture is really light weight, but it doesn‚Äôt really sink into your skin as fast as you might think. Note that it also contains encapsulated retinol. Thread carefully if you have sensitive skin, always patch test. Since it‚Äôs a retinoid, I would wait 72 hours after the patch test before applying to face.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** A-Derma Exomega Control Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser   **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Niacinamide, 10-Hydroxydecenoic Acid, Avena Sativa (Oat) Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oenothera Biennis (Evening Primrose) Oil, Peg-100 Stearate, Polyacrylate-13, Polyisobutene, Polysorbate 20, Sorbitan Isostearate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a heavy-duty moisturiser. Perfect for a broken skin barrier and really sensitive skin. It has a slightly oily finish, and never seems to sink completely into my facial skin, unless I use very little. It contains niacinamide (5th ingredient) and oat extracts, both are great for angry and needy skin. It is sterile with an air tight opening, and thus doesn‚Äôt contain any preservatives. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend as a daily moisturiser for most skin types, however, because of the texture, but nice to have in your drawer for when you skin is in need of a little bit more lovin‚Äô. Would recommend for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure.\n\n**NAME:** A-Creme Oparfymerad  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, PEG-32, PEG-6, Glycerin, Canola Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Triethanolamine, Sodium Cetearyl Sulfate, Methylparaben, Citric.Acid, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol .  **SIZE:** 120 ml  **REVIEW:** You‚Äôve probably only ever seen this moisturiser if you‚Äôre from Northern Europe. Anyway, it‚Äôs a no-nonsense thick moisturiser which absorbs completely into your skin. I think it‚Äôs great as a facial moisturiser for older and drier skin types in need of a heavier moisturiser, but don‚Äôt want an oily finish (like the A-Derma, for example). It‚Äôs called a-cream because it contains a little bit of retinyl palmitate, but this retinoid has zero to none antiaging benefits. This version also contains parabens, so if you‚Äôre allergic to those, choose the non-paraben option. If you‚Äôre allergic/sensitive to phenoxyethanol, then this is a great choice. Suitable for most skin types. I use it as a hand cream and sometimes as a facial moisturiser in the winter.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Sure. \n\n**NAME:** PUCA - PURE & CARE DAY CREAM  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Day moisturiser, gel-like moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua, Glycerin, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Carbonate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Isopropyl Myristate, Butyrospermum Parkii Oil, Hydrogenated Polybutene, Rosa Gallica Flower Extract, Palmitic Acid, Corn Gluten Amino Acids, Stearic Acid, Sodium Polyglutamate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Polyacrylate, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Yeast Ferment Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Portulaca Oleracea Extract, 1,2-Hexanediol, Hexylene Glycol, Hydroxyacetophenone, Cellulose Gum  **SIZE:** 50 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a Danish brand, so good luck finding it outside Nothern Europe. This is such a lovely gel-like moisturiser. At first it seems like a thick cream, but then it melts upon skin contact into a watery, but still nourishing texture. It‚Äôs my favourite moisturiser to put on my skin after a long hot shower (when I‚Äôm too tired to do a whole routine), because it has that perfect balance between watery and nourishing. If it contained niacinamide, it would have been a HG product for me. Probably suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yup!\n\n**NAME:** La Roche-Posay Cicaplast B5 gel  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Gel moisturiser, ointment, cicaplast product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** aqua/water, glycerin, dimethicone, panthenol, pentylene glycol, c30-45 alkyl dimethicone, polybutene, sodium citrate, peg/ppg-18/18 dimethicone, zinc gluconate, madecassoside, dimethiconol, manganese gluconate, sodium hyaluronate, copper gluconate, caprylyl glycol, citric acid, polysorbate 20, tocopherol  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** I strongly dislike this product. It has the texture of melted plastic. It‚Äôs gel-like, but it doesn‚Äôt melt into your skin, neither does it form a sturdy film, like some silicones do, it also doesn‚Äôt seem to evaporate. Like, what is this? You have to spread it very thinly on your skin for it to stay on, which is counter productive since many people buy it to use it as an ointment for dry patches, small burns, etc. 0/10. Buy the baume version instead, even though that also doesn‚Äôt sink into your skin a whole lot either. Or just use Vaseline. Just don‚Äôt buy this.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Never. \n\n**NAME:** COSRX Rice Overnight Spa Mask \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Oryza sativa (rice) extract (65%), butylene glycol, glycerin, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, betaine, niacinamide, dimethicone, 1,2-hexanediol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, guineensis (palm) kernel oil, hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer, cetearyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, arginine, carbomer, allantoin, xanthan gum  **SIZE:** 60 ml  **REVIEW:** It a HG product in my book and for many others. Perfect for most skin types, but maybe not if you have really dry skin. It contains 2% niacinamide, which is the perfect daily amount for me. I love the texture: watery, but nourishing. There really isn‚Äôt all that much more to say. Should be suitable for sensitive skin. Even though it‚Äôs called a night mask, it‚Äôs a leave on product: use it as a moisturiser.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\n**NAME:** CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Purified Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides, Niacinamide, Behentrimonium Methosulfate and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceramide 3, Ceramide 6-II, Ceramide 1, Phytosphingosine, Hyaluronic Acid, Cholesterol, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Potassium Phosphate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum  **SIZE:** 52 ml  **REVIEW:** When I look at the ingredient list, I think to myself: I must like this‚Ä¶ right? So, this is one of the products where I feel like I should like it in theory, but in practice I just don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not crazy about the texture, and I think it might have made my skin feel a little bit warm, too. I don‚Äôt know. My skin is normal, so I don‚Äôt really need all the ceramides and the cholesterol, and all that jazz. Maybe I‚Äôd appreciate it more if I were older or if my skin was still on the drier side? (But if I had dry skin, I think I would go with a thicker and more occlusive moisturiser.) Should be suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Probably not. \n\n**NAME:** First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Colloidal Oatmeal, Water, Stearic Acid, Glycerin, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetearyl Alcohol, Caprylyl Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Squalane, Allantoin, Sodium Hydroxide, Dimethicone, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chrysanthemum Parthenium (Feverfew) Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract, Ceramide 3.  **SIZE:** 56.7g  **REVIEW:** I like it. It has a thicker consistency, but it completely sinks into your skin (matte, skin-like finish), so you can totally use it day night. It smells of eucalyptus, and I‚Äôve read that this could cause a reaction for some people. It doesn‚Äôt contain niacinamide, but it contains oatmeal extract and a ceramide, and allantoin. Phenoxyethanol is really high up on the ingredient list for some reason. Should be okay for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, I don‚Äôt really feel like I need it atm.\n\n**NAME:** REN CLEAN SKINCARE Wake Wonderful Night-Time Facial  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (glycolic/lactic)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua Water , Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Butyrospermum Parkii Shea Butter, Glycerin, Oleyl Alcohol, Polyglycery- 6 Distearate, Myristyl Myristate, Microcrystalline Wax, Oryza Sativa Rice Bran Oil, Oryza Sativa Rice Germ Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Lauryl Laurate, Jojoba Esters, Oryzanol, Ribes Nigrum Black Currant Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon cranberry Seed Oil, Cellulose Gum, Cetyl Alcohol, Polyglyceryl- 3 Beeswax, Mannitol, Protease, Subtilisin, Behenyl Alcohol, Faex Yeast Extract, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopherol, Citrus Medica Limonum Lemon Fruit Extract, Alcohol Denat., Ananas Sativus Pineapple Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Passiflora Quadrangularis Fruit Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Vitis Vinifera Grape Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Grandis Grapefruit Peel Oil, Parfum\\* fragrance , Glycogen, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Citrus Aurantium Amara Bitter Orange Flower Water Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia Bergamot Fruit Extract, Helianthus Annuus Sunflower Seed Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis Rosemary Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulfite, Limonene, Linalool \\*100% Natural Fragrance Parfum 100% Nature  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** (Also a gift.) Okay, there are so many potentially irritating ingredients in this chemical exfoliant, but I must also mention‚Ä¶ It smells really really nice. This is why people still want fragrance in their skincare, even though it‚Äôs bad for your skin. Anyway, it‚Äôs an AHA chemical exfoliant, mostly lactic acid. The texture is really nice. Would not recommend, though, because‚Ä¶ I mean look at that ingredient list. Come on. Maybe I‚Äôll use it on my body. Seriously though, it smells so nice: citrus, clementine. Could this be a perfume instead?   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream 10 AHA \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser with chemical exfoliant: AHA (10% glycolic acid)  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Aqua (Water), Glycolic Acid, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Decyl Oleate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Isocetyl Stearate, Ammonium Hydroxide, Arginine, Isostearic Acid, Dimethicone, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Dicetyl Phosphate, Ceteth-10 Phosphate, Shea Butter (Butyrospermum Parkii), Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin, Methylparaben.  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This is a really nice chemical exfoliant. Even though it‚Äôs 10% glycolic acid it‚Äôs still very gentle, and that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs in a cream vehicle. I only use it once a week, though, and I haven‚Äôt used it recently because I‚Äôm using retinoids now. Most exfoliating products come in a watery vehicle, which isn‚Äôt ideal, because the products you put beneath and on top could in theory mess with its pH and make it less effective. When I use this product, I use it alone, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. When I wake up the next day, my skin is glowing and soft. Since I have normal skin and I‚Äôm quite young, using a chemical exfoliant is kind of overkill, however, so you definitely don‚Äôt need one, I‚Äôm just so extra. It‚Äôs a HG product for me, because it‚Äôs the perfect AHA exfoliant and moisturiser. Not suitable for sensitive skin and you have to bring your A game, sunscreen wise, if you start using retinoids and chemical exfoliants.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely! \n\n**NAME:** The Ordinary. Vitamin C Suspension 30% in Silicone  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Vitamin C product  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Dimethicone, Ascorbic Acid, Polysilicone-11, PEG-10 Dimethicone.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** I think it‚Äôs great if you have sturdy skin, and you‚Äôre lazy, or just busy. Because ascorbic acid is such a finnicky ingredient in skincare. At least in this formulation it won‚Äôt oxidise. The texture of the suspension feels kind of‚Ä¶ dry? You might wake up with an orange pillow. I like it, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone. My skin can take a lot of vitamin c, too, btw. Not suitable for sensitive skin.    **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe. \n\n**NAME:** Timeless 20% VITAMIN C + E FERULIC ACID SERUM \\[HG status\\] \\[not pictured\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Serum, vitamin c  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Water, Ethoxydiglycol, L-Ascorbic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Alpha Tocopherol, Polysorbate 80, Panthenol, Ferulic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, Benzylalcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** This is the serum to buy if you‚Äôre looking for a vitamin c product. It‚Äôs perfect. It was actually Skinceuticals that discovered that ferulic acid and vitamin e stabilises vitamin c and makes it even more effective. They patented the formulation, but now that the patent is no longer in effect, there are many dupes on the market, and this is one of them. It has more vitamin c, and it won‚Äôt cost you an arm and a leg. It has a water-like texture, that sinks completely into your skin. Mine lasted for over a month, but there was no noticeable oxidation happening. And I did not keep it in my fridge. It also didn‚Äôt make my incredibly pale skin orange in any way (at least not what I noticed).  Not suitable for sensitive skin, as it contains a whopping 20% vitamin c. Patch test as always.     **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Yes!!\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Cold Cream   **PRODUCT TYPE:** Moisturiser  **INGREDIENT LIST:** PARAFFINUM LIQUIDUM (MINERAL OIL), AVENE AQUA, CERA ALBA (BEESWAX), GLYCERYL STEARATE, CETYL ALCOHOL, BHT, C20-40 PARETH-10, CETYL PHOSPHATE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), METHYLPARABEN, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, TRIETHANOLAMINE  **SIZE:** 40 ml  **REVIEW:** This also falls into the category of: ‚Ä¶why did I buy this again? Cold creams do not protect your skin from the cold, first and foremost. It might actually do the opposite. This is a very occlusive moisturiser, it does not sink into the skin or dry down. Could be used on try patches, I guess. It contains perfume, so there‚Äôs that. I would just buy Vaseline instead, honestly.   **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Nope. \n\n**NAME:** BYBI BAKUCHIOL BOOSTER  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Facial oil, retinoid alternative  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Squalane (Olive), Bakuchiol  **SIZE:** 15 ml  **REVIEW:** This little cutie is 99% squalene oil derived from olives, and 1% bakuchiol (not to be confused with bakuchi oil of which it is derived from). Bakuchiol is the new skincare ingredient kid on the block. Some research suggests it works the same way retinol (or retinoids in general) work, but without the irritation, and it is also suitable for pregnancy/breastfeeding. I haven‚Äôt seen any noticeable changes in my skin, but I haven‚Äôt been using it long enough or regularly enough to know if it works for my skin or not. Plus I have young skin. I think this product is perfect for those of you who like facial oils (I don‚Äôt particularly like them), or if you want to buy squalene oil, you might as well buy this one. I mix two drops with my nightly moisturiser. Should be suitable for sensitive skin.  **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Maybe, but I‚Äôll probably spend an eternity finishing one bottle, so‚Ä¶\n\n**NAME:** Av√®ne Ysth√©al intense anti-wrinkle skin renewal concentrate \\[HG status\\]  **PRODUCT TYPE:** Retinoid: retinaldehyde  **INGREDIENT LIST:** Avene Thermal Spring Water (Avene, Aqua), Triethylhexanoin, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Ceteareth-20, Polymethyl Methacrylate, Ceteareth-33, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyl Dimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Benzoix Acid, Bht, Caramel, Disodium Edta, Mica, Oenothera Biennis (Evenin Primrose) Oil (Oenothera Biennis Oil), Oleoyl Dipeptide-15, Oleyl Tetrapeptide-31, Phenoxyethanol, Red33 (CI17200), Retinal, Silica, Sodium Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide (CI77891), Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Glucoside.  **SIZE:** 30 ml  **REVIEW:** (NOTE: This is the same product as ‚ÄúAv√®ne RetrinAL 0.1 Intensive Cream‚Äù, but the one sold in Europe, not America.) This is a retinoid product, specifically a retinaldehyde (AKA retinal) product. If you don‚Äôt know what retinaldehyde is, well, it‚Äôs one step closer to tretinoin (retinoic acid) than retinol. Your skin has to, theoretically speaking, convert: retinol √† retinaldehyde √† retinoic acid. Only retinoic acid has skin benefits. This formulation contains 0.1% retinaldehyde, and it is Av√®ne‚Äôs lab that has conducted the studies on the effectiveness of retinaldehyde, so they should know how to package and formulate it. All the retinoids are very light sensitive, so that has been a worry of mine, when buying over the counter retinoid products. This is the highest concentration you can find on the market. I have had no irritation, but I did one day feel almost sunburned (no visible change), after having used three pumps of product over a few days. I think I over exfoliated via the retinaldehyde. No noticeable purging, but I also don‚Äôt have acne, only the occasional tiny pimple. I‚Äôm only 22 years old, so I have no visible aging yet, so I use this an age preventative product, not as an anti-aging product. I‚Äôve done a lot of research on when the appropriate time to start using a retinoid is, and frankly, there is no one-fits-all-answer. It depends on which dermatologist you ask. Most say you can start when you‚Äôre 25-30 years old, especially if you have pale skin. Tretinoin was primarily used on teenagers and they grew up to have above average younger looking skin, so it definitely doesn‚Äôt seem to hurt starting before you turn 25, or before you have wrinkles and sun spots. I think it has also helped my blackheads, btw. They‚Äôve added colour to the formulation, and I wonder if that is to protect the retinaldehyde from light. I use 2-3 pumps of product on my face, neck, and hands above a light weight moisturiser. It has the consistency of a medium thick moisturiser. No perfume. Airtight bottle. Definitely patch test, probably not suitable for sensitive skin. Do not use if you‚Äôre pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or breastfeeding. Note that this is a lot more affordable than Medik8‚Äôs retinaldehyde products, plus it was Av√®ne that conducted the research on retinaldehyde.      **WOULD REPURCHASE?** Definitely. \n\nAfter having spent a solid three hours writing these reviews, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôll post the sunscreen/SPF review separately (and a little bit later). Feel free to ask me about the products in the comments, btw!",

Hair is so hard so photograph properly, If I get more accurate pictures, I'll edit to add.\n\nSo life's pretty bad right now, so I'm not able to do the elaborate hair care routine I used to. Nowadays, I don't even get time to oil my hair and if you've read any of my old posts, I'd have mentioned how I never ever wash my hair without oiling. But hey life changes :(\n\n# \n\n# Step 0 : Hair Mask\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI work around not being able to oil my hair by using a hair mask before shampooing But I don't do this all the time, once every 4 or 5 washes.\n\n\\*Product: Plum Avocado Nourish-up Hair Mask\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Glyceryl Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/glyceryl-stearate), [PEG-100 Stearate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-100-stearate), [Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/butyrospermum-parkii-butter), [Cetearyl Alcohol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cetearyl-alcohol), [Behentrimonium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/behentrimonium-chloride), [Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/helianthus-annuus-seed-oil), [Propanediol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propanediol), [Ethylhexyl Palmitate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexyl-palmitate), [Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/persea-gratissima-oil), [Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/argania-spinosa-kernel-oil), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Ethylhexylglycerin](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ethylhexylglycerin), [Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/pentaerythrityl-tetra-di-t-butyl-hydroxyhydrocinnamate), [Fragrance](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [Sodium Gluconate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-gluconate)\n\nUsage timeline: Around a year? Though it definitely took me a few months to figure how best to use this.\n\nConsistency: White Cream\n\nUsage : I take scoop up 2 Tsp worth of this, spread it between my fingers and run it through my hair, from shoulder length till ends. Once all the strands are more or less covered, I put it up in a bun and wipe off the rest on the hair on my scalp (just the top, not near roots). I leave it in for avg 30 minutes (minimum I've left it on for is 15 minutes, it still works, but I like effects better with 30 minutes). Then I wash it off with a shampoo.\n\nI have used this as a regular conditioner and results were very sub-par compared to Matrix Biolage purple cap. If you check my post history, I would have actually criticized this (UNFAIRLY) because it didn't work as a conditioner. Using it as per the brand instructions is the best way to go with this product.\n\nReview: Normally when I skip oiling, my hair feels very dry, rough. But with this it doesn't. So why this instead of oiling? Time crunch. I simply don't feel like my hair absorbs oil in 30 minutes, the hair stays greasy, I end up using extra shampoo to remove the oil, I end up over-shampooing and ending up with dry hair anyway. This is just more convenient, less messy.\n\nThe only part yet to be seen is hair growth, I used to use hair oils with all the usual healthy haircare ingredients like bringraj and what not. While I haven't oiled my hair in like a month, even though frequency was low, I still randomly oiled.  I want to stop oiling for some more time, to see wihether oils actually help or whether derms are right and it's unnecessary. I've always felt it helped, so I want to see if its placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* All the benefits of oiling, without the messiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 1: Shampoo\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Product: Scalpe pro\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Purified Water](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Coco Amide Propyl Betaine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/cocamidopropyl-betaine), [Propylene Glycol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylene-glycol), [Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-cocoyl-glutamate), [**Zinc Pyrithione**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pyrithione), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Perfume](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [**Piroctone Olamine**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine)**,** [**Climbazole**](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/climbazole), [Amodimethicone](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/amodimethicone), [Acrylates/‚ÄãVinyl Neodecanoate Crosspolymer](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/acrylates-vinyl-neodecanoate-crosspolymer), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Menthyl Lactate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthyl-lactate), [Polyquaternium-10](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-10), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-7), [Imidurea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/imidazolidinyl-urea), [C12-14 Sec-Pareth-5](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/c12-14-sec-pareth-5), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Butylated Hydroxytoluene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/bht), [Disodium Edetate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-edta), [Sunset Yellow Fcf](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sunset-yellow-fcf)\n\nPrice: MRP Rs.185 for 100 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 4+ months\n\nConsistency :\n\nUsage: I take a coin sized amount, add some water, lather it up and apply on scalp only.

Kept dandruff well under control, lasted a long time WRP if necessary. Only thing stopping me is the price), Scalpe+ (Ketoconazole based, extremely harsh and drying but also wasn't as good Bioderma in dandruff control), Selsun green cap (this did nothing. I couldn't wait for this to get over, so that I can move on to something else. Which was quite shocking because was a cult favourite and my dandruff is mild to barely there).  In my case, dandruff is barely visible, I  keep track of how well a shampoo is working by keeping an eye on my forehead. I cant get horrible CCs if I don't regularly use an anti-dandruff shampoo for maintenance. Since I've started using this no CC outbreak. Scalp is clarified, no dandruff. As good as Bioderma at 1/10th the price.\n\nThe only con is the size. Wish it was available in bigger bottles.

I've raved about Alpecin before, I think (I'll add a mini-review below, anyway) But this gives me exact same reuslts at a lower price and higher quantity. I suspect the reason is because of Polyquarternium 7 (if you guys remember, there was this amazing post on moisturising body washes that spoke about this ingredient). It does have a little bit of wheat protein, so this may not work for low-porosity hair, and because of that I don't use it below shoulders if I'm planning to use a protein conditioner. But in a pinch, I can just use this and skip conditioner and even ends look halfway decent, not the best, but it'll look fine for some time, if I use a serum.  And because of the presence of Piroctine Olamine, I don't have to use Scalpe pro every wash.\n\nAbout hair-fall control? No clue. I'm having a normal amount of hairfall but I genuinely do not believe that a shampoo can reduce hairfall. unless you were using a shampoo that caused your hairfall in the first place and switched to something else. I'm completely going to disregard the hairfall controll claims.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG Forever Repurchase\\* barring reformulations, in which case I'll fall back on Alpecin\n\nEDIT on 23/10/2022: CHANGING STATUS TO WNRP\n\nRemember that little bit of wheat protein? It really messed up the balance of my products. It's too little for it to give the effect Plum Olive and Macadamia hair mask gives, but too much to actually use that Plum. So when I used the Plum I got protein overload and then had to overdo moisture to counterbalance it and then that got too much and ....well the delicate balance was lost. The bad effects slowly built up over time and 6 months after I started using this, I'm done. I got really fed up one day because my hair was either frizzy or crackly and ordered Alpecin again and single wash and my hair got sleek again. Second wash and the shinyness is back. Yea, I'm losing volume but this just looks so much better. So I'm just going to suck it up and pay more for Alpecin in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Alpecin Double Effect Caffeine Shampoo\\*\n\nIngredients:  [Aqua](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/water), [Sodium Laureth Sulfate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-laureth-sulfate), [Laureth-2](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/laureth-2), [Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/disodium-laureth-sulfosuccinate), [Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-lauroyl-glutamate), [Panthenol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/panthenol), [Caffeine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/caffeine), [Parfum](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/parfum), [PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/peg-120-methyl-glucose-dioleate), [Hydrolysed Wheat Protein](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydrolyzed-wheat-protein), [Salicylic Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/salicylic-acid), [Sodium Chloride](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-chloride), [Sodium Citrate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-citrate), [Piroctone Olamine](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/piroctone-olamine), [Potassium Sorbate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/potassium-sorbate), [Citric Acid](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/citric-acid), [Polyquaternium-7](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/polyquaternium-7), [Menthol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/menthol), [Sodium Benzoate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/sodium-benzoate), [Zinc Pca](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/zinc-pca), [Niacinamide](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/niacinamide), [Limonene](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/limonene), [Tetrasodium Etidronate](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/tetrasodium-etidronate), [Phenoxyethanol](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/phenoxyethanol), [Methylparaben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/methylparaben), [Propyl Paraben](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/propylparaben), [Ci 60730](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/ci-60730)\n\nPrice: MRP 699 for 200 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: Don't remember.

I use ross scalp massager to spread this all over my scalp.\n\nReview: This shampoo was the first in my life, that showed my what an excellent shampoo is capable of. I've used shampoos I liked and repurchased before, but the effects this gave, blew my mind. I had such sleek, shiny hair. Since I have very fine hair, even though volume is medium, my hair tends to stick to my head making it look thin. This didn't exactly make it look voluminous but it looked normal while still looking sleek and frizz-free. This shampoo was a revelation. (All of this is applicable to the re'equil hairfall control shampoo too). Only reason I switched was because SO loved this and kept stealing my bottle, so I looked for something cheaper. And is clear there are enough similarities in the ingredients list of Alpecin and Re'equil for me to give it a try.\n\nAnd about Hair-fall control, I bought this when I was having major hairfall due to hormonal and health issues. I've posted about my haircare journey before and this was a try out of desperation. Alpecin had funded studies that proved their claims (BIASED) but Dr.Renita Rajan on Instagram had also kept recommending this in the weekly Q&As, so I bought it. It didn't really help. No visible or drastic reduction. I eventually turned my health around and moved to my old place, where water suits my hair. When I moved, there was visible reduction in hairfall. Now it's quite normal, I'd say but I just cannot credit either this or re'equil for it. Maybe it'll work for other,s but since my hairfall had underlying causes, this didn't help me. SO also has hairfall issues (genetic, not health related) and claims he DOES see hairfall control and he likes the way it makes his hair look/feel so he still uses only this. His claims are dubious because while he's observant, he's not actually been tracking, so it could be placebo.\n\nBottomline: \\*WRP\\* if Re'equil does any reformulations.\n\nI have this superb video showcasing exactly what alpecin does, unfortunately my face is too visible. If anyone can tell how to blur my face or something, I'll share that.\\\\\n\nEDITED on 23/10/2022:  STATUS CHANGED TO HG for reasons mentioned above.

Will update soon.\n\nPrice: MRP 449 for 300 ml\n\nUsage Timeline: 2+ years and I'm only done with half the bottle\n\nConsistency: Normal Shampoo\n\nUsage: I take a lot and apply it from shoulders to ends, if I've not oiled my hair.\n\nReview: I literally had to go and check what the name of this product was to type this review and I've been using it for 2+ years. I think that says it all. This is gentle. So gentle, it doesn't remove oil. I have to use copious amounts of this to even attempt oil removal and even then hair remains a little bit oily. I use it more often now, that I don't have time to oil. It's does nothing great, I'm using it only for the sake of finishing it and once I'm done, I'll probably forget I ever used it. It might suit people who wash their hair everyday and don't want a shampoo that actually cleanses, but even that's suspect.\n\nBottomline: Trash. \\*WNRP\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Step 3: Condition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a MoIsTuRisINg conditoner and a protein-heavy conditioner.

If hair is starting to lack protein, this can fix it in a single use. If you have left it too long, then it might take a couple of uses BUT it will definitely fix it. Solid, Dependable product.  The reason this is a mask and is called mega moisturising mask, is because people mistake lack of protein for dryness and expect moisturising will fix it. A product like this will receive polar extreme reviews because when people who need protein use it, it shines. But when people with low porosity who only need conditioning use it, it can cause protein overload and you will end up with straw like hair. The key to using this and loving it, is knowing your own hair and it's needs.\n\nBottomline: \\*HG\\* Forever Repurchase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tips on figuring out whether your hair needs Protein or Conditioning\n\n\\*This is applicable only to my hair type. I've not experimented on  other hair types\\*\n\n* 1A hair should feel soft, when you run your fingers through your hair. Even if you have tangles, it should detangle pretty easily with just your fingers.\n* Comb your hair. If after combing it's shiny but feels dry (Kinda static-y) and is prone to (more than usual) tangles - CONDITION\n* If you hair feels dry and strawlike.  Very Rough. Brittle in a sense. It's lost lustre - ADD PROTEIN\n* Use the feel of well conditioned hair (immediately after application) to judge. You know that smooth feeling you get when you run your fingers through your hair after rinsing off conditioner? That must be there after every single conditioning. If you have used a moisturising conditioner and hair still feels rough while rinsing your hair, you hair needs protein, take a little bit of protein conditioner and condition again. And vice versa.\n* How often you need protein depends on your hair porosity. High porosity hair needs it more frequently and low porosity hair can go months without needing it. It's not a simple switch every wash kind of thing.  It's important to keep the balance right.\n* I know some experts call both moisture fatigue and protein overload myths but guys I've 100% had protein overload and it's very difficult to deal with problem, because beyond a point all you can do is wait for your hair to lose protein in the normal wear and tear while conditioning and you just have to deal with straw hair meanwhile. So I'm not going to discount the anecdotal evidence (mainly mine).\n* When I was young and willing to try NaTCHuRal things above all else, I used to use a banana + egg or banana + mayo hair mask, when my hair felt dry. And it always worked. Immediate and visible difference after hair dried. I later realised the reason it helped must have been because my hair needed protein. Though someone on here told me egg protein is too large to penetrate. Either way it was not placebo, because I used it for years when I was a teen. So maybe you could try that too if you suspect your hair needs protein. But be very sure, before you try it out. Maybe try it out on a chunk of hair first and then you can compare it with the non-conditioned chunk.",

        "body": "The \"Bio-Protein Care and infused with Glutamic Amino Serum\" is not doing anything in the formula except giving their marketing people something to talk about.\n\nThe shampoo is also not having much effect on frizz as the only ingredients that might last through rinse-off include the Guar (cationic polymer) and maybe the dimethiconol (silicone).  Although in reality, the dimethiconol mostly gets rinsed away too.\n\nIn the conditioner, the ingredients that are having the greatest impact include the Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dimethiconol/Silsesquioxane Copolymer, and Behentrimonium Chloride.\n\nThese are all ingredients you can find in other formulas. \n\nThe idea that the smoothing performance is unlike anything on the market is debatable. There are likely lots of products that can give you the smoothing effect of these products. However, using a combination of very good formulas (these are), an appealing fragrance, and solid marketing, you can come to believe it is the best you've ever used.  Just know that you haven't used everything and there are lots of products that you would be happy with if only you could test them on a blinded basis.",

    "body": "I am a hairdresser and have been doing Brazilian hair blow-drying in a salon for years. Evaporation of the product during blow-drying burns my eyes, my throat burns, sometimes I feel a burning sensation in my chest, I get headaches and sometimes migraines (I have had migraines for many years, but I noticed that I get them more often when I do more Brazilian treatments) , even some customers shed tears and have to keep their eyes closed while blow-drying. \n\n   \nI‚Äôve never thought too much about the toxicity of the product, so I googled a bit and found a few articles that write about the dangers of the contents of Brazilian treatment products, so I decided to share with you some of the substances found in CHOCOCOCO  and their side effects: \n\n* **Stearic Acid** \\- Inhalation may cause chemical pneumonitis  \n* **Behentrimonium chloride**  is considered toxic in concentrations of 0.1% and above and is suspected to cause skin and eye irritation. \n* **Phenoxyethanol** is actually very harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin, especially for breastfeeding or infants, It can also have an effect on the brain and central nervous system. If you are exposed to the product several times a day, every day, it can accumulate and probably have a bad effect on you. The American Cancer Society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen. This means it can cause cancer or help cancer grow. Formaldehyde can also trigger other side effects. May be toxic in concentrations of 1% or less. Tests show that keratin treatments contain unsafe levels of formaldehyde and other chemicals. The FDA has received dozens of product complaints. One hairdresser, for example, said her treatments caused her migraines, blurred vision, sore throat, nausea and loss of smell. \n* **Glycolic acid**  shows some inhalation toxicity and can cause damage to the respiratory system, thymus and liver if they are present at very high levels over a long period of time. \n* **Coumarin**  is moderately toxic to the liver and kidneys. \n* **Benzyl benzoate** side effects: irritations of the skin, eyes, nose and throat that can cause severe symptoms such as burning, nausea, vomiting and damage to the liver and kidneys. \n\n Some manufacturers claim that their keratin treatment does not contain **formaldehyde**, although there are studies that state the opposite. \n\nI would just like to briefly explain the process of Brazilian blow-drying for those who do not know: \n\n1. Hair is washed with a special shampoo (from the manufacturer, of course) \n2. The product is applied to dry hair, after 20 min it is blow-dried  \n3. Blow-drying causes a strong and visible evaporation of the product, the steam of which goes straight into my face (after blow-drying, the whole salon stinks of it, and is in the fog)  \n4. Hair is ironed at 220'C (which causes evaporation, but not in such quantities)  \n5. After the treatment, the hair is washed with special shampoos (Again, from the manufacturer, of course) \n\nI just want to state that I am not a chemist nor am I knowledgeable in chemistry in any way so I hope if someone is educated in this field I would be grateful if you would leave an opinion, also I do not know the percentage of these substances because their website does not state it.  \n\nHere is a list of all the ingredients in their product: \n\n Aqua, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Keratin / Hydrolysed Keratin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Beta Vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark / Leaf / Twig Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Anthemis Nobilis (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Behentrimonium Chloride, Caprylic / Capric Triglyceride, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii, Shea Butothera Evening Primrose) Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides Oil, Chondrus Crispus (Carrageenan) Extract, Maris Sal (Dead Sea Salt), Dehydroacetic Acid, Aloe (Vera) Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Squalane, Ascorbic Acid Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Fragrance, Retinyl Palmitate, Phenoxyethanol, Glycolic Acid, Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Benzyl Salicylate  \n\nThanks for reading and I will be grateful for any information and opinions <3",

        "body": "Hmm looking at that ingredients list I have to say it looks very innocent imo! I would have expected to see some hard core stuff in such product. Looking at Kerastase and Redken ingredients lists are generally way more frightening. I can‚Äôt see any really nasty things in the list- the nastiest ones are Coumarin, Linalool, Limonene, Alpha- isomethyl ionone and benzoyl salicylate. These are fragrances that are more allergenic than when the list just says fragrance or perfume ( the manufacturer has to write the most allergenic fragrances separately in the list). But again- all of these will be found in almost any salon hair products with fragrance- and in a lot of ‚Äú natural‚Äù products as well. Phenoxyethanol is in basically every product you buy for hair, body or face. It acts as a stabilizer or as a preservative in products and became highly popular when parabens got unpopular. It is generally considered safe in small concentrations ( under 1%) for adults. It‚Äôs not considered safe for children under age 3 and should not be used if you‚Äôre pregnant or breastfeeding. It has nothing to do with Formaldehyde as far as I know. Again- phenoxyethanol is in almost any product, even in the most sensitive no perfume no color brands. If you have to avoid it I think you would be limited to raw oils and the baby products.\nOverall I think that the list looks very descent. With some quite good stuff in it as well.\nAlso FYI I‚Äôm not educated in this, so I‚Äôm by no means an expert- it‚Äôs just a weird hobbyüòÖ\n\nEdit: I would also recommend wearing a mask and glasses when using. It looks safe when applying normally to hair but it‚Äôs not meant to be inhaled/ go in the eyes of course.",

        "body": "While you‚Äôre not wrong that the traditional Brazilian blowout is very toxic and releases formaldehyde when heat is applied to the hair the initial time at the salon, I am not reading anything specifically in those ingredients you listed that would cause this process. Glycolic acid would be suspected if it were high on the list, because glyxolic acid and ingredients with similar names may consist of one of the first ingredients in a ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù Brazilian blowout (which still releases formaldehyde, they tend to just be sneakier about their product claims). The ingredient list you posted doesn‚Äôt have those ingredients, from what I can tell (but hey, I‚Äôm not a chemist, so if anyone is an expert in that field, please chime in). \n\nBehentrimonium chloride is an extremely popular ingredient in many hair conditioners, both drugstore branded and professional. I haven‚Äôt heard any recent research regarding controversy with the ingredient, but it very well could only be toxic under certain circumstances of which I can‚Äôt attest to (such as applying heat and keratin with it). \n\nThe first ingredient is water, the next is a harmless emulsifier (which allows the cream to keep it from separating), the third ingredient is an animal protein that comes from animal hair/hooves/horns. It‚Äôs not a scary ingredient, it‚Äôs just a cheap protein compared to keratin. Then keratin, followed by a lot of essential oils (which I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they were the culprit here). Fragrances, especially ones as volatile as essential oils, *especially* when you mix a buttload of them, generally do not play well with being heated against the hair at 450F. The rest of the ingredients are comprised of ingredients that make up less than ~1%, like tiny fragrance ingredients (linalool, limonine), and preservatives to keep it from spoilage (benzyl salicylate). \n\nI would definitely discontinue that brand, especially because unless there are extra ingredients/steps in the treatment aside from that ingredient list, I‚Äôm not sure I understand how they are meant to last for 3-6 months on anyone. None of the ingredients to form any sort of lasting keratin bond to the hair appear to be in that ingredient list, and the ones that could potentially play any role are in such minutes qualities to almost be meaningless. The glycolic acid being near the end of the ingredient list suggests it‚Äôs much more likely that it was a minor pH adjustment to the formula, not any life-changing chemical reaction. It seems as if your salon is getting ripped off by whoever is promoting their line of keratin treatments to you. The Cezanne line is one of the better ingredient lists out there, but I‚Äôve only been doing a deep dive (as a current stylist) on this treatment since right before I did one on myself. I did the long lasting Cezanne treatment and there is absolutely no smell at any point in the process. You just have to make sure when you rinse the product, you don‚Äôt rinse too much of it out before you pat-dry and blow dry or there won‚Äôt be enough keratin still on the hair to bond correctly.",

    "body": "You want to know if it worked...I'm burying the lede here. Stay with me though.\n\nI have not had a chance to read the papers K18's team wrote in the last 10 years, so I decided to do this \"part 1\" with current results, then a part 2 with paper/patent comments plus how my hair fared in an upcoming bleaching service.\n\nK18 is a post-wash leave-in treatment applied on towel-dried hair. The claim is \"...molecular breakthrough clinically proven to reverse hair damage in 4 minutes\" from bleach, dyeing, heat, other chemical services like perms.\n\nAnd\n\n>Traveling into the inner-most layers of hair to reach the core polypeptide chains (keratin chains), our revolutionary K18Peptide‚Ñ¢ is just the right size and makeup to fit in and reconnect broken chains.\n\nIngredients as of this writing:\n\nWater, Alcohol Denat., Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Dicaprylyl Ether, Cetyl Esters, Behentrimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 20, sh-Oligopeptide-78 (K18Peptide‚Ñ¢), Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Wheat Starch, Isopropyl Alcohol, Tocopherol, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Fragrance, Geraniol, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Benzyl Alcohol.\n\nIt is sold in 5 ml sample sizes or 50 ml full size. The pump pushes out about 1ml of product and anywhere from 1 to 4+ pumps is needed for the treatment depending on hair length, volume, & strand thickness. The lotion goes over clean but not conditioned towel-dried hair. Once applied, it needs to sit on hair for 4 minutes before using any other product.\n\nThe instructions are to use every time you wash your hair for 4 to 6 washes. If using a lot of product (no explanation on how 'heavy product use' is defined), the website text recommends a clarifying shampoo before application. After the initial 4-6 applications, the rate is 1 application every 3 to 4 washes.\n\nPros (and DOES IT WORK?):\n\nK18 improved the look and feel of my bleached hair ends, and the hair ends curled with no coaxing needed and felt soft/shiny again. The time my hair takes to dry without products shortened by 1.5 hours. Frizz diminished. Squishing my hair after washing produced less water. And I got to day 4 curly hair, which had not happened to me, ever.\n\nI saw significant change after application #4. I had committed to doing 6 washes/applications, so I continued. Areas of my hair that had been bleached more than the rest showed improvement last.\n\nLike Olaplex, K18 does something good, but I cannot state that it does what it claims (insert peptide chain in cortex, have peptide chain chemically link up bits and pieces in cortex). I did not test elasticity.\n\nK18 significantly improved hydrophobicity. Based on the list of ingredients I bet there is heavy adsorbtion of cationics going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess pro, but not cons:\n\n1. The amount to apply is tiny, and spreading it throughout the hair is challenging because one cannot see where product has been applied versus where it has not, plus the product is all over your palms, so cannot feel, either. For my hair I needed 4-5 pumps (4-5 ml), so I applied in sections, ends first, and hoped for the best.\n2. For people whose curly hair routine includes putting styling products in sopping wet hair, or not touching curls, using K18 requires rethinking all that as it is applied on clean towel dried hair, and must  be applied before any other hair product.\n3. If you co-wash, I would suggest using a shampoo that does not deposit much of anything on the hair prior to using K18\n4. The dosing chart is hidden on the product page (you must select the accordion chevron--the arrow pointing down-- to the right of \"how to use\"  to see the text)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssorted: If buying the 50 ml product in the US, your cost is $1.50/pump. The 5 ml sample cost is $2.40/pump. Also, their customer service answered my questions pretty fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill I buy again? \n\nEDITED 5 /8 / 2022: Link to Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18\\_my\\_experience\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/ule42z/k18_my_experience_part_2/)",

I wanted a shampoo that would cleanse without making my hair dry . So that‚Äôs when BA ultra smoothening shampoo came into play & it‚Äôs been the only one I have been using since back then . The ultra smoothening hair mask is also my HG if u have ultra rough + fine hair . Probably not the best for thicker hair types . I have seen considerable improvement in my scalp health cz the shampoo would cleanse without stripping moisture . Also , if you sweat a lot or use lot of products & theres buildup on ur scalp , this won‚Äôt be enough. You might have to add a clarifying shampoo once in 2 weeks or a month . I have used their smoothening hair serum but unfortunately that didn‚Äôt work . Their hair growth serum seemed promising cz it did reduce my hair fall considerably. Their anti-dandruff range is bad , my brother used it & got more dandruff instead .",

Your moisture barrier is shot and you're dreading spring hayfever?\nI'm here to help, thanks to far too many hours spent shopping for products that my skin will tolerate.\nEvery product here is:\n\n* Vegan\n* Cruelty-free\n* Completely fragrance-free: no masking fragrances, \"natural\" fragrances, or essential oils\n* Free of irritating and sensitizing plant oils like lavender, thyme, citrus, and eucalyptus\n* Ragweed allergy safe: free of chamomile, feverfew, echinacea, calendula, and other ragweed flowers\n* Retinol-free\n\n**Warning for the highly ragweed sensitive:** Certain non-ragweed ingredients can cause cross-reactions in some people with ragweed allergies. These ingredients include sunflower oil, safflower oil, watermelon seed oil, and cucumber fruit extract. Also, bisabolol/levonemol is often derived from chamomile and could cause reactions. I noted the products that contain these ingredients.\n\n**Products may contain other allergens, such as soy and nuts. If you have any severe allergies, read all ingredient lists carefully! No product can be safe for every allergy!**\n\nThis list is US-centric; products from other regions are marked with their country of sale. The list is sorted alphabetically. (The price-per-ounce column was falling out of date too quickly with rapid price fluctuations; please see the [outdated 2024 version of the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganBeauty/comments/18wh8k1/bland_fragrancefree_nonirritating_moisturizer/) for the most recent version sorted by price.)\nFeedback and corrections are always welcome!

Is it down to the pH of a product, a single ingredient, an interaction between two of more ingredients? ü§î\n\nHere's the ingredient list of a clear gloss by dpHUE:\n\n- Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone, Polyquaternium-10, Triethanolamine, ParfÙè∞Äum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.\n\nAnd here's the ingredient list of a clear gloss by an Indian company called 2.Oh!:\n\n- Aqua (Water, Eau), Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-30, Isodecyl Oleate, Synthetic Beeswax, Cetrimonium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Undecane, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Tridecane, Sodium Hydroxide, Parfum (Fragrance).\n\nIs this beyond a layperson reading of ingredients lists/ just impossible to tell without using the product? \n\nThe ingredients just read like a conditioner to me. I was told that it would extend the life of a semi-permanent hair colour... does it form a coating that wears away rather than the colour that's deposited?

It's at about mid/upper back in length, and the only color I have is very very grown out highlights that are near the ends. I'm pretty oily at the roots, I wash my hair every 2 days or so, and cannot go longer than that despite my many attempts to try the hair training myth.\n\n**The goals I set with my subscription:** Oil Control, shine, volume, moisture\n\n**The ‚Äúfactors‚Äù they included based on my zip code:** UV protection, humidity, water hardness, pollution, wind. (who knows how much of this they actually factor in but whatever lol.)\n\n**Full Ingredients lists:**\n\n*Shampoo:*  Water, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Polyglyceryl-4 Caprate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Decyl- Glucoside, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Sodium Methyl Oleoyl Taurate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glycerin, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Jasmin Flower Water, Propanediol Dicaprylate, Fragrance, 1,2-Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Tocopherol, PPG-Caprylyl Ether, Pyridoxine, Panthenol, Jujube Bark Extract, Peppermint Leaf Extract, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Polyquaternium-10, Tropolone, Hydrolyzed Quinoa, Kale Leaf Extract, Citric Acid, Spirulina Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Yucca Stem Extract, Arginine, Cannabidiol, Cocamidopropyl PG- dimonium Chloride, Grape Seed Extract\n\n*Conditioner:* Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Octyldodecanol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Fragrance, Cetrimonium Chloride, Birch Juice, Caprylyl Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-7 Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Laureth-7, Polyquaternium-10, Tocopherol, Polysorbate 20, Poppy Seed Oil, Plum Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Cocamidopropyl PG-dimonium Chloride, Potassium Sorbate\n\n**(These lists look pretty basic to me. But I am curious on your thoughts on them.)**\n\n**The story:** I received the first order of Prose a few months ago. I genuinely liked the idea of customized haircare, so I was hopeful. Like many other people, they were *all over* my fucking IG ads, and this annoyed me but I (unfortunately) love trying new products way too much to ignore them üôÑ. The set was good. I loved the scent, I loved how my hair looked, and it felt healthy & clean with each wash. It was spring at the time, and there was enough humidity in the air for my hair to have some volume in addition to these other perks. As the weather got cooler, I noticed that the formula seemed almost too conditioning for winter where humidity was much lower. This lead me to believe they did not in fact update it based on the weather in my area. My hair was very flat and limp, and occasionally felt weighed down. There was absolutely no help with the sebum control, but that was to be expected.\n\n**Flash forward to yesterday's post-** I read that the OP had very similar experiences to me *but* experienced more shedding with this product. Andddd I got to thinking. ***I, in fact, was noticing a lot more shedding than I was used to.*** I can't really recall when this increase in shedding started, because my hair was shorter when I first started using it (tiny past shoulder length)- so less hair showed in my shower drain cover. Now, my ponytail just feels a bit less thick. I can't see any bald spots or anything like that, and it is not something very severe- but the combo of seeing a lot of shedding in the shower and this less dense feeling in my ponytail made me feel just a little off. Like something just wasn't quite right. \n\nToday I decided to wash my hair with a different shampoo, a higher end drugstore one from Target called ‚ÄúOdele Volumizing Shampoo‚Äù which I used before Prose. And yall‚Ä¶ The shedding was much less. Like, MUCH less. I am still shocked.\n\n\\***Let me just say\\*:**\n\n* ***I know that it is not common that a product alone causes more hairfall, and that usually there is a different or underlying reason.***\n* ***I recently had bloods and a physical and all is well with my health***\n* I highly doubt this product is actually harmful, so I am guessing that it simply caused more breakage to happen and that‚Äôs what I was seeing in the shower. But I will never really know.\n* ***This product caused no irritation or visible signs of it not agreeing with me, or I would have stopped using it.***\n* I normally would not jump to conclusions, but after seeing such a consistent amount of hairfall each time, it was too different of a result for me to not take into account. I am going to continue to use the regular shampoo and see if anything changes.\n\n**What's my point?:** Prose is ultimately a gimmick. They have very convincing ads that pray on people's fears about cosmetics and their hair health. My hair *looks* great with it, but I shed more for whatever reason and I'm not into that. I'm not sure I trust they are real chemists, either. \n\nThank you for reading!",

Since curly hair is perpetually moisture-starved, I got this leave-in a few weeks after it came out.\n\n**Ingredients:** \n\nWater, Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Cetyl Esters, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Behentrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-6, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Limonene, Isopropyl Alcohol, Citric Acid, Cetrimonium Chloride, Coumarin, Parfum/‚ÄãFragrance\n\n**Initial Uses:**\n\nFor the first 3 times I used this, I did as they recommended, i.e. applied it on clean, dry hair at night. It feels a little sticky to touch after application, but that goes away by the morning. After the first use, I did not rinse it off the next morning. It hydrated my hair *very,* my hair was extremely soft. However the amodimethicone in it made my hair kind off frizzy and difficult to manage. For the next 2 washes, I decided to rinse it off in the morning without any shampoo. That ended up working better for me.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. Intensely hydrates.\n2. Has some slip, you could potentially use it as a styling product if you have fine or wavy hair that doesn't like heavy products.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. It has fragrance. Heavy fragrance. *Almost-gave-me-a-headache* fragrance. C*ould-probably-be-used-as-a-perfume-if-you-tried-hard-enough* fragrance.\n\n**How I use it now:**\n\n1. I apply it on wash days as pre-poo. I leave it on for an hour and then wash off.\n2. Also I accidentally spilled some on my forearm once, and turns out it works fine as a lotion lol. So now sometimes I just put some on my arms if they're feeling extra dry. Probably a waste of product to use it like this, but it feels better than just leaving it on the shelf.\n\nAll in all, if you are okay with silicones and fragrance, I would recommend this. However I WNRP myself.",

The issue is that there are thousands of these compounds with different names - no ingredient list will have \"quaternary ammonia\" listed. It will be \"behentrimonium chloride\" (looking at you CeraVe) or \"benzalkonium chloride\" (busted, WaterWipes). They won't always have chloride in the name, but -ium is a tip. \n\nI wanted to share with all you awesome moms out there that you can use chatgpt (or whatever multimodal ai you prefer) to snap a picture of ingredients and ask \"are there quats in this?\" In nerd circles, \"quats\" is a common term for quaternary compounds. \n\nThe paper wasn't a smoking gun to health impacts, but scary enough for me (a molecular biologist) to think of these compounds as guilty until proven innocent.

    "body": "About my hair- 2a/2b dry coarse low porosity hair which is a little longer than my waist.\nI have always had a tough time finding a conditioner / mask , any mask loaded with silicones make my hair not clump to form waves and puff out. Matrix hydrasource mask was the only thing that has even come close to my hg but unfortunately they stopped selling the mask on retail basis and it is intended only for saloon purpose and with the pandemic I don't think I will be stepping into a salon anytime soon. So I was looking for an affordable alternative and someone in this sub mentioned this one. Now the coming to ingredients \n\nMatrix biolage hydrasource mask- \nAqua , Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, stearyl alcohol,Cetyl Esters, fragrance,  Phenoxyethanol, Isopropyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis / Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride , sodium citrate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Coumarin, Linalool, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Benzyl Alcohol, Hydroxycitronellal, Amyl Cinnamal. \n\n Loreal total repair 5 masque - \nWater, cetearyl alcohol, mineral oil, dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulphate, cetyl esters, lactic acid, phenoxyethanol , trideceth-6 , chlorhexidine digluconate, limonene, benzyl salicylate, amodimethacone, 2-oleamido-1,3-octadecanediol, fragrance,cetrimonium chloride, butylphenyl methylpropional , Hexyl cinnamal.(they have reformulated since the last time I used it about 2 years ago)\n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\n     Now coming to texture , the loreal one is tad bit thicker than the matrix mask and the slip provided is also lesser than the matrix mask. So I needed about 1.5 times  the amount as matrix one . The shine provided by both are same .They both act similarly when it come to making my waves form and hold. The loreal one is not as moisturising as the Matrix mask , and the frizz is also a little more than matrix mask.  So overall I would say  loreal total repair mask comes close to matrix by about 85%  . And it is costlier than the matrix biolage hydrasource mask, so I will again start my search once this one gets over.",

I used their conditioner as well, and for a while, it made my hair nice and soft.  \n\nThen all of a sudden, my hair started to get extremely dry and tangled all the time. I am talking self dread locking, small animal around the nape of my neck tangled.  I first chalked it up to being winter and my jacket/scarf being the culprit, but as we moved into and through summer, same problem.\n\nI started changing conditioners, trying different ones, but nothing seemed to help.  I tried protien treatments and that seemed to help. Then I realized, it was not the protien treatment that was helping but the aphogee shampoo for damaged hair which had SLS in it. \n\n I have been experimenting with this theory and it appears that whenever I shampoo with the aphogee and my regular conditioner its fine.  If I use the SLS free shampoos I have, tangled, dry mess. I am thinking that the more natural shampoos just dont cut it (literally), I think there is junk left on my hair, which means that the moisture from my conditioner isn't penetrating in there and also that junk likes to stick to junk, causing tangling.\n\nIs there any rhyme to my reason or am I totally off base here?

At first, its was wonderful, felt super nice in my hair and for the first time in my life, my frizziness was gone just after using the shampoo and conditioner.\n\nI thought I'd found a shampoo that was perfect for my hair finally, but just recently, it hasn't been so great. For the first 2 weeks, all my frizziness was completely gone, but it seems it comes back more and more with each wash, and I've been getting little tiny flakes of either dandruff or product buildup. I always make sure to scrub my scalp with the pads of my fingers and work the lather down, and the conditioner absorbs so well  into my strands that there's barely anything to wash out after waiting a couple minutes. On top of that, my hair has been getting greasy on my second day, which never happened on any shampoo I've ever used (Suave, Tresseme, RegisDesignline, Big & Sexy, Paul Mitchell). I don't use any heat products or any other kinds of products to set my hair, so I don't think that it's because of damage or product buildup, unless it's somehow the shampoo itself. \n\nI'm really at a loss at this point and not sure if I should try a different line within Shea moisture, to give this one a bit more time, or to try a different brand.\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Shampoo**\n\nWater (Aqua), Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin (Vegetable), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Trichilia Emetica Seed Butter, Ficus Carica (Fig) Extract, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Stearamide AMP, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopherol, Honey\n\n\n**Shea Moisture Mafuka Honey Conditioner**\n\nWater (Aqua), Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Butyropermum Parkii (Shea) Butter *, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Trichliav Emetica Seed Butter, Behentrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Cellulose, Glycerin (Vegetable), Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Dicaprylyl Ether, Honey, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend) Tocopherol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG Propyl Silanrtriol, Caprylyl Glycol, Ficus (Fig) Extract",

It smelled SO lovely and it had been recommended to me by my sister who has defined ringlets so I thought I'd give it a go. I have 2c hair and oh man this stuff was a disaster for me. The top of my scalp was always so so waxy. Yes, I do mean waxy, not greasy. It had turned the hair on the top of my scalp into a straight (no longer wavy) waxy mess. I was full of dandruff, my head was also itchy (which made the dandruff even worse, and god I mean it was *insane* how itchy I was!!!) so I figured I should use more shampoo and really get it sudsing to wash it out. It made my situation worse. I was not using any product in my hair and going to work on the daily so it was always in a bun and I let it air dry almost every night, I was treating it right so I couldn't understand wtf was happening. \nAbout that time I decided I needed a hair cut and apologized in advance to the hair stylist and told her my woes (I'd never seen her before) and once I told her I was using this line of shampoo and conditioner she told me immediately to stop using it. The shampoo I had been using was full of too many oils and I wasn't clarifying my hair in any way. I was kinda drowning my hair in oil. The conditioner didn't really help much either. \nI haven't used their products since cause I was so upset from what it did to me. I know I used a different shampoo but there's something about this line that could never groove with my hair. I stole a pump from my sister's styling cream and it gave me a headache all day from the scent and my hair didn't take to it, either. \nI tossed my bottles in the end. You could try another one of their products that may actually wash your hair better and you can avoid all the dandruff but my experience has been bad with this line.",

    "body": "Looks like we are receiving more scalp-targeted skin care products which is very exciting! There are little scalp focused products (although there are more lately in the form of scalp acids).\n\nThis line also has a shampoo but the treatment/conditioner is what I would really like to discuss. What's different, from just a glance, is that it's more \"dermatologically\" proven. It claims that the ingredients used are \"certified by Korean ministry of food and drug safety\" and it is also \"certified as low irritation through a rigorous skin patch test by Korean dermatology research institute.\"\n\nThis product REALLY caught my eye because I am constantly looking for more scalp-care products. It is my understanding that conditioner shouldn't touch the scalp, (especially if you are acne prone). I have a sensitive scalp prone to inflammation which is why I am very interested in scalp care. If this product is everything the marketing for it claims then this might just be a holy grail for scalp-focused skin-carers.\n\nPY's approach is interesting because most conditioner seem to be formulated as a hair conditioner first and skin conditioner second. In my experience, products formulated like this tends to leave an irritating residue as the consideration for the scalp is secondary. Their testing seems to be addressing this.\n\nI don't pay much attention to the hair loss claim in itself (only in terms of how much it improves scalp health which obviously affects hair health in the long term).\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR:This hair conditioner is designed with scalp-contact in mind making this product stand out from most other I've seen on the market (something like a wash off scalp mask + hair conditioner)\\*\\*\n\nIt seems like a pretty new product (so long shot asking if anyone has used it) but this is product really caught my eye so I will try it out and report back.\n\nif this seems like an ad for this brand, it's not. I'm just really passionate about scalp health lmfao (check my posting history and rifle through the housewives and university posts)\n\nany thoughts on this product's formulation or comments on scalp-care asian products in general?

    "body": "I did bury the company name somewhat, but if you made it here, you'll find it. Everything I say here is my opinion based solely on their website content, and I've never tried their products or even heard of them before today. Part of the reason that I am so specifically critical of this brand is that they also sell an expensive oral supplement for hair, which I think is inappropriate for any cosmetics brand to do, but it is especially worrisome from a tiny one that is so loose with their claims for other products.\n\nOn the other hand, seldom does a company make it this easy to read their labels with some kind of confidence, so I thought it might be interesting to share. On the website product pages they do a couple of bullet-point type \"contains X% of Y\" that I call advertising claims for ingredients, but when compared to the full ingredients list it becomes obvious just how far they're stretching. In one case it is obvious that the claim percent is probably how much of the material as supplied they use, the rest are less clear.\n\nI want to say that despite the cleanwashing and the painfully bad sciencewashing this brand does, these may not be bad products to use, though they all range between somewhat and ridiculously overpriced. However, they are pushing the limits of language use in advertising/marketing to the flimsiest edge of reason and legality, and their \"science\" is a mish-mash of misleading puffery, long debunked fearmongering misinformation, and some other stuff I think they pulled out of thin air. Given all of the aroma chemicals in some their ingredients lists, I'd love to know how they would define \"synthetic\" in relationship to fragrance.\n\nThey have filed a patent application both World and US for stirring ingredients together at room temperature to make their products, which has got to be some troll level BS, or maybe a shady sidestep attempt to patent protect the cosmetic products ingredients lists or formulas without actually doing anything patentable. They are not Skinceuticals making a breakthrough with C E Ferulic. I mostly skimmed these because reading such patent apps is a good treatment for insomnia.\n\nWorld patent app here: https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2019165115A1/en\n\nUS here: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200375877A1/en\n\nThe US version removes claims 8-17 as compared to the World version.\n\nNo idea where the hyperbaric chamber nonsense fits into this, but I laughed very hard at what seems to be a cut & paste definition of a pressure chamber from somewhere else. The patent app doesn't mention needing a hyperbaric chamber, despite the website claims.\n\nLast thing that I can't let go of: A quick lab test is not a clinical trial. In this case it \"proves\" that the 3 main products used in sequence will clean some synthetic sebum out of standardized hair samples in a lab.\n\nOh, and they've registered a trademark for Cold Processed. Yeah. https://uspto.report/company/Act-Acre-Inc\n\nAnyway. Enough of my judgemental rambling. On to the real reason for this: the labels!\n\nThey start as expected, but everything under 1% is listed alphabetically for most of their products. There are a few I didn't include here. I've formatted them to italics at the point where they go alphabetical to make it more obvious.\n\n**Act+Acre Stem Cell Serum** (for the scalp)\n\nAdvertising claim amounts: 2% apple stem cells, 2% bamboo and pea extract\n\nIngredients list as of April 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (ALOE), Bambusa Vulgaris Leaf/Stem Extract (BAMBOO), Caprylyl Glycol, Carbomer, Citric Acid, Plant-Based Collagen, Ethylhexylglycerin, Glucosamine Hcl, Glycereth-26, Lecithin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate (RADISH), Malus Domestica Fruit Cell Culture Extract (APPLE), Pentylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract (PEA), Propanediol, Quercus Petraea Fruit Extract (OAK), Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Xanthan Gum*\n\nNote: Raw material manufacturers have been trying to make plant stem cells happen in cosmetics for well over a decade. I have not tried any and have no plans to do so. PhytoCellTec's SDS for their apple stem cell extract on Lotioncrafter's site gives the amount as 9% of the whole solution as supplied.\n\n**Hair Cleanse**\n\nAd Claim: 2% Apple amino acids, 0.045% Baobab oil (they say it supports a healthy scalp microbiome, not sure how that applies in a rinse off)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Sodium Cocoyl Apple Amino Acids, Triethyl Citrate, Sorbitan Oleate Decylglucoside Crosspolymer, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Glycerin, *Acrylates Copolymer, Acrylates/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Copolymer, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylyl Glycol, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Cocamide Mipa, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Gamma-Nonalactone, Glycol Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hexylene Glycol, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil (LAVENDER), Menthyl Ethylamido Oxalate, Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Potassium Sorbate, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Lauroamphoacetate, Steareth-4, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET), Xanthan Gum* \n\nNote: Oils are only put in shampoos for making label claims.\n\n**Scalp Detox**\n\nUndoubedly misleading as heck ad claims: 4.55% Aloe & Calendula Extract, 2.73% Botanical Blend (either of those could mean anything)\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil (SUNFLOWER), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil (SOYBEAN), Isostearyl Linoleate, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil (BAOBAB), Moringa Oleifera Seed Oil (MORINGA), *Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (ALOE), Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Oil (AMARANTH), Calendula Officinalis Extract (CALENDULA), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Oil (ORANGE), Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil (COCONUT), Ocimum Basilicum Hairy Root Culture Extract (BASIL), Vetiveria Zizanoides Root Oil (VETIVER)*\n\nNote: Calendula is frequently extracted in sunflower seed oil for commercial use, and oil soluble aloe extracts are also widely available. The process for how they claim to stir this formula together is in the patent application as Working Example 3. A version of the hair cleanse is example 1. Anyway, I would guess that it is probably 80% or more C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.\n\n**Conditioning Hair Mask** (also called Restorative Hair Mask)\n\nAd claims: 2% castor oil, no other % claims but mentions shea butter and panthenol benefits\n\nIngredients list april 6 2022: Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Isoamyl Laurate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Glycerin, Diheptyl Succinate, Triethyl Citrate, Arachidyl Alcohol, Di-C12-15 Alkyl Fumarate, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, *Amyris Balsamifera Bark Oil (AMYRIS), Aquilaria Agallocha Wood Oil (AGARWOOD), Arachidyl Glucoside, Behentrimonium Chloride, Behenyl Alcohol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Nut Extract (SHEA BUTTER), Cananga Odorata Flower Oil (YLANG YLANG), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Capryloyl Glycerin/Sebacic Acid Copolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Ceteareth-20, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cistus Ladaniferus Leaf/Stem Extract (ROCKROSE), Citric Acid, Dimethyl Heptenal, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil (CARDAMOM), Ethylhexylglycerin, Gamma-Nonalactone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Extract (SUNFLOWER), Hexenyl Acetate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Ionone, Juniperus Virginiana Oil (CEDARWOOD), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Pogostemon Cablin Oil (PATCHOULI), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil (CASTOR), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract (ROSEMARY), Sclerotium Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Tocopherol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Vanillin, Viola Odorata Flower/Leaf Extract (VIOLET)*\n\nNote: The star here is Crodabond CSA INCI: Hydrogenated Castor Oil/Sebacic Acid Copolymer. It does have a tiny amount of plain castor oil too. Hard to say how accurate that 2% claim is.\n\nTheir **Hair Oil** doesn't have the detailed ingredients list that would show off their obvious fragrance inrgedients, as it would crush the \"just 5 natural ingredients\" idea, but they also say their squalane is squalene in the ad copy and I am petty enough about that kind of thing to put this here. \n\nAd claim from website: 5% plant-based squalene, 5% Argan oil\n\nList: Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil, Squalane, Argania spinosa kernel (argan) oil, Crambe abyssinica seed oil phytosterol esters, Fragrance\n\nNote: As far as brand cohesiveness, this is an odd choice given the detailed ingredients lists of the other products that include the names of aroma chemicals and carefully avoid using the word \"fragrance\" but it is probably the most honest.",

Hairfall was still there didn‚Äôt notice change in texture of hair or anything as such except for the headache the fragrance gave me . \n\nFirst tried leaving it overnight, so I applied the lotion on my scalp and slept with a bun covered with a shower cap and took bath the next afternoon. This gave me headache so never repeated this process . \n\nSecond I did the same steps except for leaving it overnight I let it stay on my scalp for 3 to 4 hours and then took bath. I did this every 4th day and repeated it for 3 weeks. \n\nThird as I didn‚Äôt find any change in my hairfall and I hated the smell of this also I started missing my DIY hair masks so much as I felt like those made my hair look so much more healthier than this , I went back to using my DIY hair packs and mixed a spoon of this mask approximately into it and my hair felt so much better than all the past hair wash days.\n\n[Texture of the lotion](https://preview.redd.it/xdoi6tlztm371.jpg?width=4312&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60a7382ed996671565b4f89879168d7084a03d00)\n\n* I will not be repurchasing it. There are much better products out there.\n\n* **My rating** : 3/10",

This advanced, silicone-free conditioner, with sea kelp extract, moisturizes your hair without weighing it down. Lightweight conditioning molecules leave hair moisturized and full of softness and body. The second essential step in achieving your Perfectly (Un)Done wavy look.\n\nMade in USA\n\n**Ingredients** (as listed on product):\n\nWater (Aqua) , Cetearyl Alcohol , Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine , Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract (Kelp) , Behentrimonium Chloride , Fragrance , Dipropylene Glycol , Lactic Acid , Potassium Chloride , Disodium EDTA , Methylchloroisothiazolinone , Methylisothiazolinone\n\n**Price**\n\n$5.79 fo 25 fl. oz. \n\n**Where to Buy**\n\nI got mine at Walgreens. I know this is a new conditioner, so it may be hard to find for a while. I would imagine it's going to be in every other store that carries Tresemme soon. :)\n\n\n**How to Use**\n\n(from the bottle)\n\n* Start with TRESemme Perfectly (Un)Done shampoo\n* Apply mid-lengths to ends\n* Run a wide-tooth comb or fingers from roots to tips to detangle and work into hair\n* Leave on for 2-3 minutes\n* Rinse thoroughly\n* Style with Perfectly (Un)Done styling products\n\n**Pros**\n\nGREAT slip, so perfect for detangling.  It smells nice too(I prefer this scent to the Naturals conditioner scent).  My hair felt soft after rinsing.\n\n**Cons**\n\nAs a leave-in, it was too watery. When I scrunched, it seemed to ALL come out. I don't even know how to describe it! I would add more conditioner, same thing. I would try to get most of the wetness out of my hair before adding the conditioner, same thing. \n\n**Overall**\n\nAs a rinse out- fabulous. Would definitely use again.\n\nAs a leave-in, I'll pass and go back to my TN Radiant Volume conditioner.  Sad... I really wanted this to work as a LI since the Radiant Volume conditioner is so hard to find.\n\nNOTE: I have read reviews on Naturallycurly.com where ladies LOVED this as their leave-in.  It was just too light for me. I need a thicker consistency to keep my thin curls clumped together.  ",

I explained to her that I had never used it before and that it was not me.\n\nNow today, as I prepared to leave for a holiday in South Korea this morning - my mother asked me to buy another bottle of the hair treatment (without realising it was hair treatment). My sister saw and exclaimed \"so it was you using it!\". My mother explained that she had been using it for some time on her face and that it made it really nice - both me and my sister screamed internally and we had to explain to her that it was hair treatment.\n\nSo what I'm wondering at this point is - would be there be any harms in her using the hair treatment as a face wash? The ingredients are written in Japanese but I pulled the listing from Amazon Japan and have transcribed/translated them below:\n\n> water, isopentyl diol, behentrimonium chloride, glycerin, stearyl alcohol, dimethicone, behenyl alcohol, cetanol, DPG, maltitol, aminopropyl dimethicone, steartrimonium chloride, camellia seed oil, lactic acid, lemon extract, rose water , Royal jelly extract, soybean seed extract, isopropanol, isopropyl myristate, PEG-2 laurate, amodimethicone, SODIUM METHYL COCOYL TAURATE , salicylic acid, PPG-2-deces-12, EDTA-2Na, cetrimonium chloride, BG, tocopherol, Sodium benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Flavor, Red 227, Yellow 4    \n\nI punched them into CosDNA and can't see anything particularly of concern but I'm not an expert by any means but I was hoping to get input from people with more knowledge.",

The fourth ingredient is amodimethicone (following water, cetearyl alcohol, and behentrimonium chloride). I'd use it with a shampoo containing cocamidopropyl betaine. I saw a gentle shampoo from Cantu that looks like it could work really well, but for some reason the listed ingredients differ between websites. \n\nMy question is, would this conditioner work as a substitute for heat protectant spray? I flat iron on occasion. What if I were to use it as a leave-in? (This might be too heavy for my hair though). I'm not a huge fan of sprays because the spray usually gets on my face and can cause breakouts, and it's hard to get even coverage. \n\nEDIT: I also found this leave-in that supposedly only contains water-soluble silicones - [Bed Head Control Freak Serum](https://www.ulta.com/bed-head-control-freak-serum?productId=xlsImpprod4750119) - but it's a little pricey, and I also don't know if the water-soluble silicones are strong enough or high enough in the ingredient list to offer adequate heat protection.

Heat protection sprays are designed to protect from heat settings that get up to 450 degrees (depending on the product).\n You can test heat protection sprays and how well they buffer the heat.  1. Simply spray the product on one hand and leave the other hand free from product. I like a liquid spray. 2. Take a blow dryer and apply heat to the hand that has the spray. Count how many seconds you can withstand the heat from the dryer. 3. Next apply heat to the hand that doesn‚Äôt have product and count how long you can stand the heat.\n There should be a noticeable difference between the  heat. This will give you an idea of how effective your product is working. \n Also with liquid sprays you can spray the product your hand and apply to avoid contact with your face. Hope this helps.",

I'm in Canada and was using Live Clean shampoos and loved them, but wanted something in a bigger bottle as my boyfriend showers at my place often and we were just blasting through those little bottles together.\n\nI thought Yes To Carrots would be a great replacement, and at first it was fine. But after about six weeks of use, my hair is very dry and I'm experiencing itchy, flaky scalp for the first time in years. Granted, this could be due to the extreme cold weather we've been experiencing of late, but I'm pretty certain it was the shampoo.\nAlso, I'm not sure if the Live Clean shampoo contains silicone, and using Yes To Carrots simply revealed the true state of my hair (which is admittedly pretty damaged at the ends).\n\nEither way, I didn't enjoy the shampoo. On a more superficial note, the shampoo was very thick and difficult to squeeze out of the small opening (not an issue with the conditioner), so I unscrewed the cap and eventually just transferred it to a different bottle.\nAnd perhaps my biggest complaint: it BURNED my eyes! I'm not one to let shampoo run down my face in the shower, but I somehow couldn't keep this stuff far enough away from my eyes.\n\nAnd the conditioner, meh. It was fine. I'd buy it again, in fact.\n\nI notice that the reviews on the Yes To Carrots website are quite mixed. If you're curious about it and it won't damage your wallet, I'd still say it's worth a try.",

If any of you spot any silicones, sulfates or otherwise problematic ingredients I'd really like to know!\n\nHappy holidays to you all :)",

I am simply commenting on the lack of certain ingredients essential for a moisturising hair mask)\n\nIngredients list of biolage hydrasource:\n\nWater, cetyl alcohol, behentrimonium chloride, stearyl alcohol, cetyl ester, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, isopropyl alcohol, aloe vera juice, limonene, chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, sodium citrate, hexyl cinnamal, coumarin, linalool, Butylphenol methyl propional, benzyl alcohol, hydroxycitronellal, Amy cinammal.\n \n(The one provided on nykaa is not for the Indian version.... üòê)\n\nIngredients list for aaranyaa hair pack:\n\nIngredients overview\nPurified Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Niacinamide, Emblica Officinalis (Amla) Extract, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (Guar Gum), Eclipta Alba (Bhringraj) Extract, Acacia Concinna (Shikakai) Extract , Polysorbate 20, Vitamin E Acetate, Cedarwood Oil, Moringa Oleifera (Sahjan) Oil, Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Citric Acid, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Seabuckthorn) Oil\n\n(I am not an expert on this, so if I'm wrong someone please correct me. Also if something works for you, then it works for you, ingredients list shouldn't be what makes or breaks it for you because cosmetic formulators are not idiots)\n\nThese are supposed to be moisturising hair masks... But here's the thing... there's no humectant... Not even one.\n\nBoth of these have fatty alcohol which provide that soft feel you'll be getting after using them and the cationic surfactant behentrimonium chloride will provide the slip for detangling but there's no humectant which imo feels like an essential ingredient in a hair mask, not even the humble glycerine... (Granted there is straight up water for hydration but really... Buying moisturising hair mask that depends on water for hydration?)\n\nI've seen curly hair influencers reviewing them saying though they provide slip they don't moisture their hair which kinda makes sense. These feel like detangling conditioners rather than moisturising hair masks. (again this is an opinion formed solely by looking at the ingredients list which isn't the be all end all)",

Any others who use/ have used their products? \n\nHey, first time poster here but a huge fan of the sub! I've been through many products the last year or so trying to find new products for my hair that fit me. I have long silky and straight hair but it gets easily split ends and can get very tangled in the mornings..\n\nI have recently tried a new brand though - the biosilk shampoo and conditioner plus silk treatment. I have paid much for hair salon shampoo and conditioners but these did not work as good as the biosilk products. I'm very surprised how good they work for my hair, the shampoo and conditioner makes my hair instantly combable after showering, which I've never experienced before! So long story short, why does the products work for me? Are the ingredients good long term? Any others who use or have used the products? If so, what was your experience with them?\n\n\nIngredients in the shampoo:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, Polysorbate 20, PEG-6 Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Hexylene Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Panthenol, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.\n\nIngredients in the conditioner:\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetyl Alcohol, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Amodimethicone, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol , Panthenol, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-8, Citric Acid, Benzophenone-3, Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Extract, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citronellol.\n\n\nI noticed the conditioner has citric acid and cetyl alcohol in it, I've heard acid can let good moisture in the hair as well as bad stuff..\nAre the ingredients good for my hair/scalp? Should I continue using it without worry?\n\nThanks for replies in advance!!",

I wash my hair in the morning so I don‚Äôt really have time to do a two-step routine for my hair, or I‚Äôm really too lazy for it. Also I feel like manipulating my hair twice in the shower ends up with more hair on my drainage cap.\n\nBut the thing is I feel like my hair has been breaking and falling quite a bit, which I think is because it‚Äôs too dry and not properly conditioned. So I‚Äôm actually considering co-washing instead. \n\nI‚Äôve had these two conditioners in my closet for a while that I have not used, and I‚Äôve looked through the ingredients list, would they be ok to use for co-washing?\n\n**[Redken Frizz Dismiss Conditioner](https://www.amazon.com/Redken-Dismiss-Conditioner-protection-smoothing/dp/B00UJZRO50)**\n\n> Aqua / Water / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Paraffinum Liquidum / Mineral Oil / Huile Minerale, Orbignya Oleifera Seed Oil, Parfum / Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, PEG / PPG / Polybutylene Glycol-8 / 5 / 3 Glycerin, Pentaclethra Macroloba Oil / Pentaclethra Macroloba Seed Oil, Hexyl Cinnamal, BHT, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Citric Acid, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone\n\n\nThis one looks quite fine to me? It seems to be a silicone-free conditioner and I read that Behentrimonium Chloride is quite good to have in a hair cleanser and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any problematic ingredients in the top five.\n\n**[Klorane Conditioner with Pomegranate ](https://www.amazon.com/Klorane-Conditioner-Pomegranate-5-1-fl/dp/B000Q34W0K)**\n\n> Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Amodimethicone, Alcohol, Ceteareth-33, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Fragrance (Parfum), Isopropyl Alcohol, Methyparaben, Punica Granatum extract, Red 4 (CI 14700), Trideceth-12\n\n\nIt seems the only problem for this one could be the Amodimethicone? Which I gather from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/1woutk/all_about_silicones/?st=JGTIBFB0&sh=8c65316e) that it can be hard to wash off but does not cause a build up. I have briefly looked up the rest of the ingredients and they don‚Äôt seem to have serious red flags (except maybe the parabens). Is it still ok to use for cowash?\n\nI plan to shampoo with a sulfate-free shampoo once a week.",

The simplest way to explain it is that the b3 works like doubled sided tape inside each hair strand and helps the strands reform as one strand. This treatment is only designed to last 6ish weeks, and is not a permanent long term fix.\nAlmost all products sold as a split end ‚Äúrepair‚Äù treatment will not actually repair the split ends. They‚Äôre most likely smoothing the hair shaft to give the appearance of less split ends, and it washes out when you wash your hair.

        "body": "Why is it a problem to have silicone on the hair shaft? Specific emollients in hair care products are there for a reason. Iirc polyquats are even more difficult to remove than amodimethicone, but why bother? These ingredients impart shine and smoothness and are somewhat protective (among other things). Your hair does not contain living cells and does not require nutrients to be delivered into the inner core, nor does it require water inside the hair shaft. In fact, from my research less water in the hair shaft is ideal. So a layer of emollients will do more good than harm imo.\n\n\nObviously buildup will occur after some time, and when this occurs you can always use a clarifying shampoo. I was strictly no sulfates/silicones for a few years for my curly hair. Nowadays knowing the science behind things, I don't understand the movement.",

My shampoo has that same cleanser, and some people describe it as essentially a sulfate while others say it's the most stripping of the non-sulfates but still weaker. If it were me, I would go by how my hair feels. If your hair seems gunky, sticky, or like it won't detangle the way it normally would, you can throw in a suave daily clarifying wash. If not, maybe your hair just likes being coated in silicone (or the shampoo is cleaning adequately) and you don't have to worry about it. The other thing to watch out for is that those heavy silicones tend to prevent oils from getting to your hair, so if you feel like your hair is really dry, or like the texture of it when unconditioned is getting worse, that may be a sign to switch conditioners or at least do a sulfate wash and use a silicone-free deep conditioner before you resume using the amodimethicone one.",

    "body": "Deep conditioning is a best practice to incorporate into your hair routine. Even if you feel your hair is not damaged, deep conditioners still help maintain healthy looking hair over time. Choosing how often to deep condition and which products to use can be a challenge. Deep conditioners go by many names, but are often thicker and heavier in their ingredient concentration.\n\n(This is the entire text from my [original blog](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-deep-conditioning-your-hair.html))\n\n**What hair types and styles need deep conditioning?**\n\n* Long hair that feels dry\n* Chemically altered hair (examples: hair that has been lightened, permed, relaxed)\n* Naturally dry hair\n* [Damaged hair](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html)\n* [Hair with frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n* Swimmers that expose their hair to chlorine often\n* Beach lovers with sun-bleached hair\n* People with hard water, or who use well water\n* Anyone who frequently uses high heat to style their hair (ex: flat iron)‚Äã\n\n**What is the goal of a deep conditioning treatment for hair?**  \n‚ÄãThe two goals here are (1) hydration and (2) slip. Both help with the appearance and overall longevity of your hair's strands.¬†  \n\n\nHydration\n\n* Silky, flexible strands (versus dry, brittle ones) with more shine\n* Smooth¬†ends (versus puffy and frayed)\n* On curly hair - curls that form evenly (versus inconsistently)\n\nSlip\n\n* Reduces¬†[tangling](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-ii---tangles.html)\n* Reduces friction from¬†[traction damage](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---damage.html) (to help hair grow)\n* Reduces[ frizz](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-challenges-part-i---frizz.html)\n\n**How often should I deep condition?**  \nThis is unique to each person's hair type. Deep conditioning bi-monthly or monthly is common. If your hair is damaged, you can deep condition up to once a week. For more insights on how to fit deep conditioning into your routine, check out my post on [Hair Schedules](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-schedules.html).\n\n**What are the best ingredients for deep conditioners?**  \nBelow I've shared common ingredients you'll find in conditioner and/or deep conditioners. It's helpful to know what these ingredients are in case a company doesn't use the term \"deep conditioner\" on the product label. Other terms used for deep conditioning-related products are:¬† hair treatment, hair tonic, hair lotion and hair masque. You can also check out my post on [Hair Oils](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-hair-oils.html)¬†for more insights on ingredient lists.\n\n* Panthenol\n* Glycerin\n* Amino Acids\n* Peptides\n* Cetyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol\n* Hydrolyzed proteins (ex: wheat, soy, keratin protein)\n* Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine\n* Quaternium-87\n* Behentrimonium Methosulfate\n* Behentrimonium Chloride\n* Dicetyldimonium Chloride\n* Distearyldimonium Chloride\n* Polyquaternium 55\n* Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride¬†\n* Polyquaternium-44¬†\n* Cetrimonium Bromide\n* Cetrimonium Chloride\n* Palmitamidopropyltrimonium Chloride\n* Laurdimonium hydroxypropyl hydrolyzed¬†\n* Polyquaternium-4\n* Polyquaternium-10\n\n**How should you deep condition your hair?**  \nI've listed the process I recommend to my clients to help them get the best hydration and slip below.\n\n* Shampoo twice with clarifying shampoo, or use a regular shampoo plus a detox treatment, and¬†rinse well.\n* Ring out most of the water from your hair, and/or soak it up with a towel.\n* Apply conditioner or deep conditioner from roots-to-ends.\n* Massage conditioner and water into your¬†hair. Good coverage equals a better result. This can look like a combination of the¬†techniques below. You can read more about the squeezing and scrunching¬†technique [here](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a37304107/squish-to-condish/) in Cosmopolitan.\n   * untangling\n   * working in sections\n   * pressing root to tip\n   * gentle squeezing\n   * scrunching\n   * combing\n   * gathering all the hair together‚Äã\n* Let the deep conditioner sit for between 10-20 minutes on¬†thicker hair or¬†5 - 10 minutes on¬†finer hair.\n* Dunk hair in¬†water using a sink or cup, or just quickly rewet in the shower.\n* Use the techniques listed¬†above to press more water into the hair.\n* Do a final rise. On drier hair, this can be a quick rinse that leaves more conditioner residue.¬†On finer hair, you'll want to do a more thorough rinse to prevent the deep conditioner from weighing your hair down.¬†\n* Add leave-in products.\n* End with drying and/or styling¬† method of your choice:\n   * ‚ÄãAir dry (avoid this method if it will take more than one hour to dry)\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with¬†cold air\n   * Diffuse or blowdry with hot air and¬†[heat protection](https://www.thehairlooks.com/blog-protecting-your-hair-from-heat-damage.html)\n\n**Can you over-condition hair?**  \nIf you are experiencing hair that appears:\n\n* limp, flat or heavy\n* to have build up or residue\n* straighter than you'd like\n* greasy or too shiny\n\nthen you could be over-conditioning. Try cutting back on the amount of deep conditioning treatments in your routine, switching conditioners to one that is for volume, or lightly shampooing after you condition.

While using this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair seemed dry, frizzy, and fragile. However, it did not cause me to break out anywhere.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Sodium Citrate, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Dimethicone, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Polyquaternium 76, Sodium Chloride, Tetrasodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract, Orchis Mascula Flower Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Hydroxide, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1\n\nA little over a week ago, I stopped using both of the above products and switched to SheaMoisture's Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo to try to get away from sulfates. I started only with the shampoo, not the conditioner, because I break out very easily and wanted to test each product separately so that I'd know what product was causing me to break out if I did indeed end up breaking out (it's a mistake I've made before).\n\nThe ingredients in that shampoo:\n\n> Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\nAfter a little over a week of using this shampoo every other day, I've noticed a change in my hair. It seems healthier, less frizzy, and easier to manage. I LOVE the improvement. However, since the change, I've also experienced breakouts on my back, around my hairline, and on my cheeks where the ends of my hair touch my face. This makes me incredibly sad, because I love what this product does to my hair, but the breakouts mean I can no longer use it.\n\nAre any of the ingredients in this shampoo particularly comedogenic? Which one(s) could I be reacting to? I really like the change this product made to my hair, so is there a shampoo similar to this one that is less likely to break me out?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nIf it helps identify ingredients I might be sensitive to, a long time ago, I dyed my hair black, and after noticing that the Hello Hydration Shampoo made the color fade quickly, I switched to Herbal Essence's Color Me Happy Shampoo and Conditioner. That stuff broke me out horribly. I know that it was the shampoo and/or conditioner and not the dye because I didn't switch products immediately after dying my hair but waited a few weeks. I experienced no breakouts during that time and only broke out after switching shampoo and conditioner. I switched to both at the same time however, so I have no way of knowing whether it was the shampoo, conditioner, or both that caused me to break out.\n\nThe ingredients in the shampoo:\n\n> Water, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Citric Acid, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Xylenesulfonate, Fragrance, Cocamide MEA, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Linoleamidopropyl PG Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 33, Red 4, Yellow 10\n\nThe ingredients in the conditioner:\n\n> Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Zea Mays (Corn) Silk Extract, Rosa Centifolia Flower Extract, Passiflora Incarnata Flower Extract, Glutamic Acid, Fragrance, Bis Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Benzyl Alcohol, EDTA, Citric Acid, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Yellow 10, Red 33, Yellow 6",

    "body": "The first three products of OG curly girl Lorraine Massey's brand [Curly World](https://www.curlyworld.com) are live now. There's a cleanser called \"Sham-Free Hair and Scalp Cleanser\" ($30 for 12oz.), a conditioner for all curl types called \"Terms and Conditions\" ($34 for 12 oz.) and a tone-correcting product for light-colored and grey hair called \"With or Without Hue\" ($36 for 12 oz.). I'm going to talk about the cleanser and the conditioner because I'm not very knowledgeable about tone correcting or color-treated hair. \n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\nSHAM-FREE: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Polyquaternium-7, Menthol, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS: Aqua (Water/ Eau), Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Stearalkonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Selaginella Lepidophylla Extract, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Water, Panthenol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Phyllostachis Bambusoides Leaf Extract, Sodium PCA, Phyllanthus Emblica Fruit Extract, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Cymbopogon Schoenanthus Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone.\n\nI do think the ingredients look very promising. The conditioner seems to be great for curly and very curly hair but from the look of the INCI might weigh wavy hair down? Thoughts?\n\nPRICE:\nThese products are pretty expensive. DevaCurl products are usually around $25 for 12 oz. I suppose this is understandable because this is a one-woman enterprise. However, what doesn't help is the...\n\nSHIPPING:\nCurrently, the shipping is $9~ via USPS. Which is really a bummer because it bumps up the price of the already expensive products. However, it looks like curl-friendly salons might start selling them? Which would be helpful to at least those of us who live close to one. Or maybe curly girls who live in the same area could split the shipping among themselves?\n\nPACKAGING:\nThese products come in a soft plastic bag with a nozzle. These look cute but I don't know how easy they would be to use in the shower. For that price, maybe there should have at least been bottles?\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI have been following Massey's updates about her line and am enthusiastic about the products. Just looking at the INCI I can tell they are very well formulated. However, the price might be prohibitive for quite a few of us.",

The hair was clean, I think it was too clean, there was more resistance when brushing vs after shampoo washing, there was significantly more hair left on my hands (and on the brush when brushing too I think) when applying the product. I think the hair was somewhat sticky and waxy, but not too much.\n\nThe second time I did it the easy way - massage with water, put significant amount of conditioner on scalp, massage (and in the process get a bit on the hair and ends too), wait, wash. The hair was clean enough (not shampoo-clean, but I think that's better for my hair and for my scalp's accomodation). There was more resistance when brushign vs after shampoo washing (and I think also vs the first co-wash). There too was significantly more hair left on my hands when applying the product, but because it was applied only once it was this much less hair loss. My hair is sticky, waxy. It looks good, but feels really bad, because of the stickiness.\n\nI used warm water.\n\nTo put this into perspective, if I brush my hair downwards while leaning down, the hair will literally stay in the air afterwards as if I gelled it or something. This effect is present to some extent after I shampoo-wash too, but not this extremely. It's also quite difficult to brush in the first place.\n\nThe conditioner somewhat sticks to the hair even while washing with it, the consistency of conditioner is gluey, sticky, it doesn't make my fingers run through my hair with conditioner applied run buttery smoothly, but rather the complete opposite, I'm scared of pulling my hair out this way... No hair loss when rinsing it off. \n\nMy scalp is also itchy as fuck now. My guess is the preservatives Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are to blame, but the thing is the shampoo has them too, so maybe not and the waxiness or whatever (co-washing in general) causes this?\n\nI'm pretty certain that the conditioner causes this. I didn't use any other product. When I wash with just shampoo from the same brand (it's SLES based, but it's the opposite of potent, I take few times more of it to achieve the same potency that normal SLS shampoos have, could be the conditioner is similarly \"potent\") and either don't use any other product or only few drops of oil it won't be like this and it's pretty much what I want.\n\nThe ingredients of the conditioner:\n> Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract, Inula Helenium Extract, Humulus Lupulus Flower Extract, Helianthus Annuus Hybrid Oil, Cera Alba, Cedrus Atlantica Bark Oil, Chamomilla Recutita Oil, Geranium Sibiricum Extract, Panax Ginseng Root Extract, PEG-12 Dimethicon, Pinus Sibirica Needle Extract, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil, Pinus Sibirica Seed Oil Polyglyceryl-6 Esters, Xanthan Gum, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Ceteareth-20, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nNote that Cera Alba (Bees wax), Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride (guar gum derivative) and PEG-12 Dimethicon (water-soluble sillicon) are in it. Could it be that the Bees wax is the problem? The two other ingredients are water soluble so shouldn't be... Cera Alba (Bees wax) is also in the shampoo, but probably in smaller quantity.\n\nIngredients of the shampoo:\n> Aqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Cocamide DEA, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Propolis Extract*, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Glycine Soja Oil, Urtica Dioica Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Water*, Althaea Officinalis Root Extract*, Salvia Officnalis Oil, Carum Carvi Fruit Oil, Mel*, Saponaria Officinalis Root Extract*, Cera Alba, Panthenol, Niacinamid, Citric Acid, Parfum, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Benzyl Salicylate, Hexyl Cinnamal, CI 15985, CI 19140, CI 42090, CI 14720.\n\nShould I buy another conditioner, keep on using this one or switch to non-harsh shampoo? If I should switch conditioner, what ingredients should I be looking for except no wax and sillicon? No oils? Other surfactants (glucosides instead of kationic chlorides)? Something more oily? Something very minimalistic (just kationic surfactans like cetrimonium chloride and humectants like cetearyl alcohol)? Something with more humectants?  I wouldn't be super happy buying another conditioner just to find out it's trash and I have nothing to do with it.\n\nEdit: My hair is ~5inch/13cm long.",

        "body": "I'm no expert and this is just personal experience over the past several years but I would try an SLS-free shampoo & silicon-/wax-free conditioner to see if that helps. It sounds more like an issue with the conditioner ingredients or other products sticking to your hair and scalp then not getting washed out with the co-wash so it builds up on your hair more and more. I tried many conditioners to co-wash and also water-only but neither worked for me. My hair ended up stringy, heavy and waxy though not as quickly as you have experienced. I have very hard water where I live which can also add to the problem.  You can also look into an apple cider vinegar rinse as an alternative (lots of info on the side-bar).\n\nI have had good success with SLS-free shampoo plus silicon-free conditioner every second wash or so. I only have to wash it once a week with water-only rinses as needed in between washes and my scalp is much less itchy and dry than when I was using regular shampoo or co-washing. When particularly dry and itchy, I use jojoba oil on my scalp as a mask/cleanse before I shower, massage it in well, leave it on for 5-10 minutes then wash out . This also helps with any build-up of product on my scalp.\n\nIt will probably take some trial and error to find out what works for you and a bit of time for your scalp to transition. You may also need to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of all the build-up on your hair before starting over to give you a clean start but not everyone needs that step.",

They are 2.5 years old and although this stage is not as hard as the infant stage, it is still all-consuming(and I love it).   \n\n\nSo I'm popping back in to do a quick update on my hair. I was a faithful user of TRESemme Naturals Radiant Volume conditioner as my leave-in with LA Looks Sport Gel or Spikes Gel on top. When I heard that TRESemmme was getting rid of their Naturals line, I bought out every bottle I could find. Well, now I've run out. :(  The testing of various products shall commence immediately. (If you just want to see what I'm using now for my porous and fine 3a/b hair, skip to the end. Sorry this is long!!)  \n\n\nHoping to have success with the same line, I bought **TRESemme's Botanique Nourish and Replenish Conditioner**, but it was just too thick.  I didn't like how when I styled a gel on top of that conditioner, the conditioner just felt like it was falling out of my hair instead of soaking in. On to something else.... Price: $4.99\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI saw a review for **Not your Mother's Naturals Tahitian Gardenia Flower & Mango Butter Curl Defining Conditioner** comparing it to the Yes to Carrots Pampering conditioner(discontinued and another favorite) so I got that! It was alright, but definitely not comparable to the YTC Pampering conditioner. Price: $8.99\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy lovely husband decided to get me various Miss Jessie's products for my birthday to try. Man, those are expensive!  Unfortunately, none of those worked for my hair either!! They were all very expensive and tended to have too much glycerin in them, leaving my hair a frizzy mess in the humid summer months. I tried **Jelly Soft Curls, Pillow Soft Curls, Curly Meringue,** and **Multi-Cultural Curls**.  Knowing that I like a stronger hold gel, I figured that I wouldn't like the first two(correct), but thought the other two might work. I didn't mind the Multi-Cultural Curls, but the meringue was a fail. STILL just not what I was looking for.  I ended up giving all of the products to my friend with low porosity waves. She likes them. :) Price: $14(Jelly soft), $22(Pillow soft), $16(Meringue), $16 (Multi-cultural Curls)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI kept seeing advertisements on my FB for **LUS Brands 3-in-1 Curly styler** and although it is expensive, I bought only the styler. Major fail for me.  Many curlies love this stuff but for anyone with high porosity hair, it's too much glycerin(it's the third ingredient!!!)  It offered no hold for me and didn't really enhance my curls. I gave it five days, tried styling it many ways that they suggested, and it just never worked. :( So sad.  Price: $18 online only\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I found it.  My replacement. **Love Beauty & Planet Argan Oil & Lavender Smooth and Serene Conditioner**.  Friends, this conditioner is amazing.  I picked it up because it was new, I love lavender, and I saw \"no silicones\" on the bottle.  I can use a small amount of this conditioner and it feels like it soaks into my hair and is light BUT moisturizing.  I put my LA Looks Spikes Gel on top, scrunch and let it dry on it's own. This stuff controls my frizz like nothing else! It's been absolutely wonderful.  My hair feels conditioned but not overly soft(I know you know what I mean by that).  I just wish it was a bit cheaper, but I'm happy to support a company that is going for more natural products and has recycled bottles.  Honestly, I like how this works with my hair BETTER than my TRESemme Naturals!  Sidenote: If you don't care for lavender, once the conditioner dries, it has no scent. :)  Price: $6.99 at Target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is it!  Here are the ingredients for the Love Beauty & Planet conditioner:  WATER, CETEARYL ALCOHOL\\*, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE\\*, COCOS NUCIFERA (COCONUT) OIL\\*, LAVANDULA ANGUSTIFOLIA (LAVENDER) OIL\\*, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL\\*, FRAGRANCE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, ACRYLATES/BEHENETH-25 METHACRYLATE COPOLYMER, DISODIUM EDTA, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, CITRONELLOL, COUMARIN, LIMONENE, LINALOOL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Trying to find a replacement for my beloved TRESemme Naturals Radiant Volume Conditioner(as a leave-in), I tried many products and found Love Beauty and Planet Argan Oil and Lavender Smooth and Serene Conditioner as a conditioner that makes me happier than the TN ever did!!",

It won't hurt your hair at all because it doesn't open your cuticle, like permanent and demi-permanent color processing does. [Here's info from labmuffin on different types of hair color that goes into more detail.](https://labmuffin.com/how-does-hair-dye-work/)\n\nLunar Tides' description is right that it's non-damaging ‚Äî the ingredients indicate an intensive conditioner + color. That's it! So there's no need to wait to color or to use a second conditioner right before or after you apply the color. If you want deeper conditioning (and more intense color) just leave the Lunar Tides color on longer. (Careful though, the color can get pretty intense.)\n\nThe only thing to consider in terms of your hair's condition when applying the color is that you need to make sure you're applying it evenly, so lots of color coats ALL your hair, otherwise, you can get a patchy results. Lunar Tides' instructions will tell you to start with towel dried hair (so, slightly wet) and that helps with even application. You can also start with slightly wetter hair and leave the color on longer (I did this last time, it was fine).",

If your hair has mixed amount of damage (like roots are healthy but ends are fried) it might be a good idea to do a conditioning treatment first so that your hair all soaks up the dye evenly. It won't hurt your hair to skip this, but it might make the color turn out a bit better.",

The \"magnets\" are like a perfect \"key\" shape to fit into the perfect \"lock\" hole in your hair.  We would normally only need 0.1-0.2% protein to achieve this, because that's the practical limit of how much we can put into the bottle, but also anymore just goes down the drain.\n\nAnalogy: your hair is like a piece of fuzzy rope covered in armor plating.  There are holes in that armor and the fuzz pokes through almost like Velcro.  The protein binds to the rope that isn't covered by armor.  When it dries that protein turns into new armor.  Your hair strand is now coated in a tough film that is resistant to oil.\n\nIt doesn't work for every type of hair.  It works best for fine, limp hair.  It doesn't work as well for kinky or stiff hair.\n\nThe fixatives such as formaldehyde do different chemistry on hair.  The purpose of those is to react with disulfide bonds in hair.  You don't want a fixative in a product with protein.  It's going to react in the bottle and you will destroy the benefits of either.\n\nAnalogy: take my fuzzy rope covered in armor.  Put cement on the ropey bits.  It's going to fix in place.",

The use of \"...hydrolyzed protein which we fix with formaƒºdehyde\" suggests that during the treatment (heat?) of the hair, there is an equilibrium between HCHO-X-linked protein, and HCHO-X-linked keratin (hair). These treatments are generally preceded by a reduction step (R-S-S-R') reduction, 'relaxing' the hair fiber. This is followed by the X-linker, in this case HCHO released by the X-linked protein in the product.\n\nI was involved in the assessment and banning of the original formaldehyde-containing product from this company where I live.

The collection is currently sold exclusively at Target, both in stores and online. The line contains 18 products and is not designed to be exclusive to any hair type.\n[Five beauty editors at Allure](https://www.allure.com/story/tph-hair-taraji-p-henson-review) ‚Äì including three who have Type 4 hair ‚Äì tested the products and had complimentary things to say.\n\n##Product Details\n* __Price:__ $9.99 + tax for 12 oz. (355 mL)\n* __Hair Type:__ Curly & Coily\n* __Appearance:__ White conditioner\n* __Texture:__ Thick (maintains shape when poured); non-greasy feeling\n* __Scent:__ Light natural scent ‚Äì shea butter, olive oil, sage oil; scent does not linger\n* __Marketing Spiel:__ Hustle & Co is an ultra creamy, suds-free conditioning cleanser that deeply refreshes while moisturizing your coils, curls, and waves. No side hustle (in this case additional conditioner) necessary- Hustle & Co delivers hydrating goodness into your hair without stripping your hair of its natural oils. To use, wet hair and apply a generous amount to hair and scalp. Massage in with your fingertips and rinse. Repeat if needed.\n\n##Ingredients (NOT CG-APPROVED)\nwater (aqua/eau), cetyl alcohol, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, behentrimonium chloride, ISODODECANE, fragrance (parfum), cetrimonium chloride, AMODIMETHICONE, phenoxyethanol, laureth-4, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, polyquaternium-7, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, trideceth-3, trideceth-15, disodium edta, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, aminomethyl propanol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, salvia officinalis (sage) oil, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, limonene\n\n###Method\nFor each wash, I poured an Oreo-sized mount of conditioner. I spread the conditioner out over my scalp and massaged vigorously for about two minutes. I then took a paddle detangling brush to spread the conditioner down to my ends and undo knots for somewhere in the 3-5 minute vicinity. I rinsed for about one minute.\n\n##Results & Observations\n * The product spreads super-easily. I got great coverage and had no trouble brushing it down to my ends.\n* While my hair was saturated and even after rinsing*, my hair had a TON of slip and I could have detangled manually if I had wanted.\n* The product absorbs into my hair very quickly. Even  after three washings and trying longer-than-usual rinses, I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure that I had most of it out.\n* I would have expected my Overtone to bleed, but the water rinses out 99.7% clear. My color looks as good as it did on the day I applied it.\n* My hair feels soft and amazing now, wet or dry. \n* My hair is super, *duper* shiny.\n* I‚Äôm getting much better than average volume at the roots, which lasts through my second day.\n* Either I‚Äôm not rinsing well enough or the product is too heavy for my ends to support. I have 2b/2c hair on Day 1 and wake up with 1c hair on Day 2.  (Which I am totally willing to let slide for how nice my hair looks and feels.)\n\n#Conclusion\nI‚Äôm deeply impressed with the salon-like power of this product for its drugstore price. I‚Äôm ready to kick my existing shampoo and leave-in conditioner off the shelf and make TPH a permanent fixture in my shower.",

I didn't use the conditioner since it had wheat protein in it (I'm celiac and I try to avoid putting gluten on my hands, even if it's microscopic), but my friend said she hated the conditioner. (She has curly/kinky hair.) I warned her to be careful if it got on her scalp since AHAs increase photosensitivity. (There was no warning about this on the bottle -- perhaps there's too little % in there?)\n\nAnyone know why L'oreal would bother putting lactic acid in a conditioner? What can AHAs do for hair? Or ceramides, for that matter? I assumed that this was an attempt to capture what's popular in skincare these days, but I knew I had to ask you guys!\n\n**The copy on the bottle reads:** The new Total Repair Extreme collection contains powerful ceramide to help repair broken hair fibers**. This luxurious formula instantly penetrates into the fiber to deeply renew extremely damaged and over-processed hair.\n\nI found this rather vague, even given the standards of beauty copywriting, but maybe I don't read enough shampoo bottles.\n\n**The full ingredients:** Aqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Paraffinum Liquidum/Mineral Oil/Huile Minerale, Behentrimonium Chloride, Parfum/ Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Lactic Acid, Arginine, Glutamic Acid, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Chlorhexidine Digluconate, Serine, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Benzyl Alcohol, Limonene, Amyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, 2-oleamido- 1,3-octadecanediol, Alpha-isomethyl Ionone.\n\nAny insight?

It gave me great results and had great hold that lasted multiple days. But the last bottle I bought made my hair stringy and limp, and I threw it out after learning about the lawsuit in February. (Side note: has anyone re-purchased DevaCurl products lately and found them to work? I'm curious!)\n\nI've been trying to find products with similar ingredients and found Amika curl corps!\n\nFirst 5 ingredients of DevaCurl Styling cream ($28 on their website):\nWater (Aqua, Eau), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Tapioca Starch\n\nFirst 5 ingredients of Amika Curl Corps ($25 on their website- I got it for $15 a couple weeks ago):\nWater/Eau/Aqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Tapioca Starch\n\nI know more than the first 5 ingredients matter, but those tend to make up the bulk of a product from what I understand, so I was stoked to see that! So here's what I found on wash day (sorry for bad pics, recently downgraded to an older phone)\n\n[Front](https://i.imgur.com/SePjDch.jpg) \n[Back](https://i.imgur.com/56xP8Vn.jpg)\n\nThe Curl Corps gave me really good volume and definition. It also made me curls really soft and bouncy, which surprised me! Usually my curls are only this soft when I over-moisturize, and when that happens they're limp and lack volume as well. This was a nice middle ground for me! The next day they were a bit stretched out but still remarkably soft and not tangled. Curious to see if they stay tangle free into day 3!\n\nMy only complaints are that my curls weren't as tight as they were with the DevaCurl styling cream, and the hold is not as strong as the DevaCurl styling cream. I had tighter ringlets with DC, but that's nor a huge deal to me as I like experimenting with how tight or loose I can get my curl pattern. Regarding hold, and I could tell upon drying that these wouldn't look the same the next day by how loose the hold of the cream was. \n\nHowever, I've been lazy on my night time routine and have been wearing my hair in a loose bun with a scrunchie. If I used a silk wrap or bonnet, I bet they would have preserved better! So I can't even be too harsh on the lack of hold there. \n\nI may pick up the curl corps gel just to see how it pairs with this, but overall I think it's a solid dupe! Probably an 8/10 if anyone is interested. 7/10 if you really don't want stretchage. \n\n[Here is the next morning stretched curls with no refresh](https://i.imgur.com/qSP8tBs.jpg)\n\nEdit: whoop, just got the mod notice for a routine! Currently:\n\nPre-poo with righteous roots rx oil, shampoo with SheaMoisture JBCO or Cantu shampoo, condition with either SheaMoisture JBCO or Cantu conditioner, style with.... anything, really, I'm running out. Mainly Cantu Curl Activator, Giovanni LA hold (HG, forreal), or TRESemme mousse if I want a single product look. If I want a change between wash days, I use the SM JBCO treatment mask in the shower and then re-style to gently cleanse and add life back to my hair. Color is Arctic Fox blue jean baby over faded aquamarine, on ombre hair.",

Glad you're making the switch tho, Idk what the final current verdict is but I think I saw something with devacurl and hair loss, idk it could just be their shampoos being cruddy and ineffective, but before you buy from them again, you should check that out for yourself just in case. Currently I can't find anything on amika(negative) and they don't even seem to have a wiki page(?) but maybe I'm searching wrong, although they are very young, but from what I can tell they seem to have very good range of products, and most negative reviews are people just buying the wrong product(like someone using purple shampoo daily then getting upset their hair turns purple or it doesn't turn white(like that's not what its for) when they have darker highlights. I used to have Bright pink hair which eventually turned into rose gold, and currently am working towards a silver/salt and pepper look. Amika is expensive but It looks like they have put a lot of time into their ingredients and testing combinations. yeah they're big words and a lot, but that to me just proves dedication. \n\nI'd be happy to hear about how you're currently doing, and if you've decided tom keep using it, get something else, add something, and what's worked(:",

If there are any posts you think I should refer to, please link it below!\n\n\nI recently tried the Pureology Nanoworks Gold shampoo and conditioner set, and after rinsing out the conditioner, I could immediately tell that my hair felt softer. After drying, my hair was much smoother/less frizzy, had a lot of body, and was the shiniest I‚Äôve ever seen it. My parents, who have never commented on my hair, even said that my hair looked really healthy when we were FaceTiming. Given that the price of the products makes me want to cry, I‚Äôm hoping to get some help in figuring out what exactly is in it that my hair really loves, and I want to see if I can find those ingredients in other shampoos/conditioners. \n\n\nA little bit about my hair:\n\n\nI have thin, low porosity (I think), fine, black hair. My ends are drier and I have a very oily scalp. The oily scalp is very odd to me because I am extremely dry everywhere else on my body, but my scalp has always been oily.\n\n\nI wash and condition my hair every night, wrap in an Aquis microfiber towel for a while, remove the towel, spray It‚Äôs A 10 leave-in lite, then dry my hair with a hairdryer. I‚Äôve tried not washing my hair every day, but it just gets too oily by the second day and my hair gets stringy and looks limp. Sometimes I will use dry shampoo, but I find that it just feels like there‚Äôs a lot of gunk in my hair and I break out on my scalp. \n\n\nFor the past couple of years, I‚Äôve used Matrix Biolage Ultra Hydrasource Shampoo and ultra Hydrasource conditioning balm. I‚Äôve also used the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo/conditioner set on the days I have to wash dry shampoo out of my hair because I feel like the tea tree helps with the breakouts. For deep conditioning, I used the briogeo don‚Äôt despair repair conditioning mask, but honestly that just felt like an everyday conditioner to me, and I would mix that in with the tea tree conditioner because I didn‚Äôt feel like the Paul Mitchell one did anything for my hair. Currently I‚Äôm using the living proof restore hair mask in the same way. When I ran out of the matrix set, I switched over to the Bondi Boost hair growth shampoo and conditioner because when I finally was able to get a hair cut, my hairdresser told me that I had lost a lot of hair. Although I think it was due to stress and the fact that I couldn‚Äôt go get my hair done because COVID and I live in a different state than my home state for grad school, so my hair got really long and I don‚Äôt think it was very healthy (but it also looked really good after the Pureology set, and it looks even better now that I got a haircut and feel like my hair is a bit healthier than before). The Pureology was used here and there throughout my time with these aforementioned products, mainly because I was trying to make the product last longer, but each time I use it, I notice an immediate difference. \n\n\nPlease let me know if there‚Äôs any other info you need to know about my hair, and thanks in advance for reading this post and for any insight you might have for me!\n\n\nShampoo Infredients:\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Glycol Distearate, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Coco-Glucoside, Glycereth-26, Panthenol, Parfum/Fragrance, Sodium Chloride, Ppg-5-Ceteth-20, Methyl Gluceth-20, Polyquaternium-10, Amodimethicone, Peg-55 Propylene Glycol Oleate, Propylene Glycol, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Carbomer, C11-15 Pareth-7, Benzoic Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Laureth-9, Glycerin, C12-13 Pareth-23, Benzyl Alcohol, C12-13 Pareth-3, Trideceth-12, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Magnesium Nitrate, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Acetate, Salicylic Acid, Isopropyl Alcohol, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Melanin, Potassium Sorbate, Sorbic Acid, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Pentylene Glycol, Bht, Ethylhexylglycerin, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.\n\n\nConditioner Ingredients\n\n\nAqua/Water/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Amodimethicone, Parfum/Fragrance, Isopropyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Panthenol, Butyrospermum Parkii Butter/Shea Butter, Benzoic Acid, Trideceth-6, Sclerocarya Birrea Seed Oil, Tocopherol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butylene Glycol, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein Pg-Propyl Silanetriol, Potassium Hydroxide, Caramel, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Chloride, Helianthus Annuus Seed Extract/Sunflower Seed Extract, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, CI 15985/Yellow 6, CI 14700/Red 4, BHT, Melanin, Pentylene Glycol, Citric Acid, Ethylhexylglycerin.",

        "body": "Sounds like you're using ICE Hair Restore aka Jeesperse ICE-T CPCS.\n\nI'm assuming 3% of the ingredient, not 3% active BTC. It is about 1/3 behentrimonium chloride, according to the SDS. 3% of the blend, or 1% active BTC, is fine for leave in. You could go higher, if you like, but it might be heavy or cause stickiness.\n\nIt's not about the other ingredients as a buffer. BTC isn't an irritant the way that CETAC is, due to molecular size if I remember correctly. Cetrimonium chloride is now limited to 0.25% for leave in commercial products because of the irritation potential.\n\nHave you tried other things with BTC vs BTMS? According to chemists, there's not an appreciable difference between the chloride vs methosulfate. I've found that the difference seems to be the addition of polyquat-37, not the form of behentrimonium. I made otherwise identical conditioners out of ICE HR, BTMS-50, and BTC where I used the same percentage of behentrimonium active and adjusted the fatty alcohols to be as close as I could to the same cetyl/cetearyl blend in each one. I liked the ICE HR the best, so I have to assume that it is the polyquat-37.\n\nSince I can't buy polyquat-37, I couldn't do a 1 to 1 test with the chloride and pq-37 against the methosulfate with pq-37.\n\nThe reason I mention it is that it is bad to assume that it is the slightly different version of the one ingredient instead of accounting for other ingredients. On the other hand, if you know a retail source for pq-37 available to people in the US, I'd love to know about it!",

    "body": "**Background**\n\nI live in an area with very hard water (Minneapolis), and it‚Äôs definitely been tough on my hair. I had done the Malibu C hard water treatment packets in the past, and found them helpful. My tap water pH is 9 (!!!!! yes, nine!) and contains an average of 3.5 ‚Äì 4.0ppm of chlorine (not sure how that stacks up).\n\n I have caucasian 2a wavy-ish hair that is very fine and splits easily and is very prone to frizz if I don‚Äôt use the right products. It's virgin but damages easily. I almost never blow dry it, and flat iron it occasionally - 1x a week at most. Despite being fine textured, it can take wayyy more product than you would expect. \n\n^(Extra: I was previously using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, doing a CGM-ish routine, but have decided to switch it up my hair care this year. I think the shampoo caused buildup over time, despite me not using silicones, because I did a single wash with Malibu clarifying shampoo and swimmers treatment and holy hell did it make my hair so much lighter and bouncier! So I‚Äôve decided to stop the CGM and look for a better routine for my hair. (That means anything goes as far as ingredients.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI got the Malibu C Hard Water Wellness Shampoo & Conditioner, thinking it would be the answer to all my life‚Äôs problems. I desperately wanted them to work for me, but I'm starting to realize that they are a total bust. :(\n\n**I‚Äôve used them for 1.5 months and I wash my hair 1-2x a week. As soon as I started using them, my hair became *noticeably more frizzy*, and over time it seems to be getting worse, not better.** My hair hasn‚Äôt been this frizzy since I had a stint living in a very humid island climate. The conditioner also doesn‚Äôt feel particularly conditioning to me.\n\nAt this point I‚Äôm kind of at a loss on what to do, since I don‚Äôt have a go-to shampoo/conditioner to go back to. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the problem is so that I know what direction to go in with my next product. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Theories**\n\nI also tried HealthySexyHair Moisturizing Conditioner for one use, and that didn‚Äôt help the frizz. It was about the same. I see they both have glycerin prominently on the list. Could that be it? Another hypothesis I have is the shampoo may be too harsh on my hair, even though it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äúprotective‚Äù according to the manufacturer, and the conditioner isn‚Äôt ~~moisturizing~~ conditioning enough to combat the harshness. The pH of the Malibu C shampoo is supposedly 6.0-6.8, but I got that info from an Amazon review and can‚Äôt verify (it cited the manufacturer‚Äôs website but I can‚Äôt find it). (Not sure that shampoo pH matters relative to my tap water anyway...). Malibu C claims their shampoo is not harsh, very gentle, and can be used daily. According to the site, the purpose of the shampoo is to prevent minerals from attaching to your hair, as opposed to removing them. So I honestly can‚Äôt tell if the shampoo is harsh, or the conditioner just sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I‚Äôm trying to figure out what it is about these products that made my hair suddenly frizzy, so I can figure out what to avoid and/or look for in a replacement.

My hair also hates proteins. Cutting out these ingredients definitely helped my dry hair to grow, even if it's not perfect. I've been using a moisturizing conditioner that - at first glance - seemed to fulfill all my criteria. Half a year ago, I noticed a few hairstrands way shorter than the rest: breakage! I was shocked but tried not to panic and just give my hair some extra care. A few weeks ago, I again noticed a new strand of hair, right at my temples, that has broken off. It can't be from a bad hairstyle as the strands are on random places and I mostly just wear a braid or my hair down. So I did some further digging on the ingredients of my haircare products. I found behentrimonium chloride which seems a bit controversial. I wash my hair every 3-4 days, and usually after the second day my ends get super dry and tangled into horrific little knots. Could this ingredient be the culprit? I would also like to know about its impact on the environment as that is something I do care about a lot. (Also concerning this topic: I can not use shampoo bars or hair soaps, as I have eczema and it's too concentrated for my scalp, so please don't recommend these to me üòì) \nI'd be thankful for any insight on this!",

This is a phenomenon that has been documented when using [at least 5% of a carboxylic acid](https://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/efficacy/article/21837243/your-hair-on-acid-the-influence-of-carboxylic-acids) (AHA's are in this category of acids), however given the list of ingredients you shared, the first AHA ingredient is malic acid at #11 of 29 ingredients.  It's highly unlikely that the amount of malic acid is 5% or higher in that formula.  What I see above it on that list are almost all cationic ingredients, which are really helpful for conditioning damaged hair, but they're nothing new or unique and wouldn't change it from the inside.\n\nAs for the Omega 9, I have never heard of this being marketed as a bonding ingredient.  [Their website says](https://www.wella.com/professional/en-EN/ultimate-repair/behind-the-science/omega-9):\n\n>With time and all the different stressors, hair loses its natural surface lipids. These lipids help protect the integrity of the cuticle. Omega-9 is a bio-identical lipid, targeting the hair surface. It does not only coat the surface but also penetrates the cuticle and on its way fills the spaces to re-create a protective barrier. This reduces cuticle lifting and is noticeable in a smoother feel, less frizz and less breakage.\n\nIt's true that hair loses its natural surface lipids, this is the F-layer or lipid layer of the cuticle, composed of 18-MEA fatty acid.  Oils can't really stick to hair to condition it unless this layer is in decent shape, because oils attract oils.  However I don't know enough about the molecular structure of oils to confirm whether Omega-9 is bioidentical to 18-MEA.  So far as I know, there's no way to replenish the 18-MEA/repair the lipid layer once it's damaged. [https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/](https://new.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/comments/qljifi/comment/hj3jvun/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nThe animations they're providing are just dumb and completely uninformative, which also makes me skeptical of these claims that accompany it, although that could just be because they have a crappy website team, who knows.  I would love to hear from any chemists who have deeper knowledge than I do, but I think it's unlikely that this product does much beyond what a normal conditioner for damaged hair can do.",

I used to use Aussie products and for years 3 Minute Miracle was my go-to conditioner and it always treated me well.  About 1.5 years ago I switched to Nexxus Keraphix because I was hoping to add some weight to my hair.  It has always dried really light and fluffy, if that makes sense.  I liked Keraphix and it did what I was hoping, making my hair feel thicker and heavier.  However in about the last 5 months or so my hair suddenly became REALLY tangly.\n\nWhile I'm washing  and conditioning it it hard to get my fingers through my hair. I know you aren't supposed to brush wet hair, but I used to be able to slide a brush right through with no issues and now when I get out of the shower it is a nightmare getting a comb through it. Even a wide-tooth comb is hard as it knots up right away.  I'm 40 years old and this is a completely brand new thing for me.  I have no idea what is going on.  I have used dry shampoo and leave-in argan oil occasionally as well.  I've tried using a couple other random shampoo/conditioner combos to see if maybe it is the Keraphix for some reason, but the results were the same.  I have also been getting knots in my hair while I sleep which is a new thing, too.  Any thoughts or advice are welcome.  I feel like my hair is ruined!  Below are the Keraphix ingredients in case that is helpful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I've been reading more on the sidebar.  Does CO-Washing seem like it might help with this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeraphix Shampoo:   Water (aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidorphopyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Hydrolyzed Caviar Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Polyquaternium-10, Fragrance (Parfum), PEG-6, Caprylic/Capric Glycerides, Glycerin, Gluconolactone, PPG-9, Trehalose, Citric Acid, Adipic Acid, Sodium Sulfate, DMDM, Hydantoin, Disodium EDTA, Hydrolyzed Actin, Hyrdolyzed Roe, Fucus Vesiculosus Extract, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, PEG-150, Pentaerythrityl, Tetrastearate, PPG-2 Hydroxyethyl Cocamide.\n\nKeraphix Conditioner: Water (aqua), Cetaryl Alcohol, Dimethicone, Collagen Amino Acids, Stearamidopropyl, Dimethylamine, Lactic Acid, Behentrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Oryza Sativa, Rice Extract, Fragrance (Parfum), Dipropylene Glycol, Amodimethicone, 1,2-Hexanediol, Benzyl Alcohol, Trehalose, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, Gluconolactone, Sodium Chloride, PEG-7 Propylheptyl Ether, Cetrimonium Chloride, Sodium Sulfate, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate.",

        "body": "I think the problem could be too much protein. Keratin is a protein and there are other proteins as well in those products. When your hair gets too much protein it causes issues- like making it dry, brittle, and tangly. You may consider a moisturizing deep treatment and switch to a shampoo and conditioner that doesn't include keratin or other proteins. Our hair needs the right balance of protein and moisture or it tends to tangle easily. So of course too much moisture can also be an issue so once you get to a balance you may want to rotate your current shampoo and conditioner with a moisturizing one to maintain the balance. \nI wouldn't worry much about brushing it wet. Use a detangling brush and have conditioner or detangler in while brushing. I've got curly hair and when it's wet it literally the only time curly hair can be brushed so that's how we detangle our hair. But once you get your hair balanced you should have an easier time detangling it when dry, assuming your hair is relatively straight.",

Two of those Organix products you listed have Dimethicone, which is a silicone.  Can't tell if the shampoo is ok but I have checked a few Organix shampoos at my local drugstore and I found a few with sulfates.  \n\nYes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo is also listed there but has sulfates.  I found out after I've been using it for almost 2 months :(.  The YTC conditioner is ok though. There is also a Garnier Fructis that I made the mistake of buying but thankfully I verified the ingredients before using it.  \n\nThat \"search ingredients\" link is sadly another site that hasn't been maintained for a while :(\n\nIf you need product recommendations, try the pinned post at the top of this subreddit and scroll towards the bottom for the product recommendations.  There is also a product recommendation link at the sidebar in /r/haircarescience.  But before you buy, google the ingredients just in case the manufacturer changed ingredients",

I struggled most to find a shampoo and conditioner and after a long search ended up finding ‚Äúthe ordinary‚Äù sulfate 4% cleanser for body and hair and the behentrimonium chloride 2% conditioner. The shampoo does not really sud and definitely takes some getting used to but it works and the conditioner is absolutely amazing. I have noticed my hair get much healthier since using these to that‚Äôs an extra plus. As far as soap I only use ivory bar soap. This does not have cocamidopropyl betaine in it but might have some coconut derivatives, it works for me might not work for you (open to any suggestions you may have for soap). I also only use soap on the areas I really need it. I have stopped using soap on my arms and legs and my skin has improved so much. For lotion I use CeraVe and the Working Hands body lotion. I also use Vaseline for breakout spots and lip balm. For checking products like makeup, hair care, and more I have found the SkinSAFE app to be extremely helpful. Just scan the barcode on products and it will show you what is and isn‚Äôt in the ingredients, if it is coconut free it will show something saying ‚ÄúCOC FREE‚Äù. While I am still trying to figure out exactly what works for me this routine has helped my allergy breakouts immensely. Remember to keep it simple, when I first found my allergy I was using way too many products and cutting it down to just the basics also made a big difference for my skin. This allergy can be so frustrating and isolating and it can become really hard to remember that recovery and healing is possible. Keep pushing. ",

My scalp feels clean, there's no build-up (so far), and it's not any more oily than it normally gets. My hair in general looks nice and shiny and seems to be drying straighter (naturally, it has a very slight wave).\n\nHowever, I am noticing that my hair feels kind of tangled. It was apparent after the very first use. They aren't big tangles, but I can't run my fingers through my hair smoothly. There's always a small tangle here and there. Normally, I never ever have this issue. I've used a protein-heavy shampoo in the past (though only once a week) and even that never gave me such tangles that SM did from just one use. \n\nLooking at the ingredients, I'm not sure what might be the issue. I have medium, slightly coarse hair that is definitely sensitive to protein. The way my hair feels makes me think it's protein, but I use protein rarely and I'm not sure what might be the issue in this product. I have used coconut-derived surfactants with no issues in the past.\n\n- (**Shampoo**) Deionized Water, Decyl Glucoside(Coconut Oil), African Butyrospermum Parkii (shea Butter)*, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Argan Oil, Panthenol (Pro-Vitamin B-5), Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Guar Gum, Lonicera Capifloium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Avacado Oil\n\n- (**Conditioner**) Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii ( Shea Butter)*, Argan Oil, Coconut Oil*, Behentrimonium Chloride, Essential Oil Blend, Vegetable Glycerin, Emulsifying Wax, Sea Kelp Extract, Panthenol (Vitamin B-5) Avocado Oil, Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower (and) Lonicera Japonica ( Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower Extract, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Daucus Carota Sativa (Carrot) Seed Oil\n\nBy the way, if the issue is protein, how do I remove it? Do I have to clarify and then moisturize? Today, I used the SM shampoo but skipped the conditioner for a different, definitely protein-free product, and my hair is still a bit tangle-y. I'm not sure if it's because I used the SM shampoo or if I need to remove the (possible) protein from my hair first. \n\nThank you! ",

It is color treated (because I have some greys) and I rarely use heat to style. The one upside it that is tends to be very soft (except when I pick the wrong product and dry it out). \n\nI am getting so turned around and confused with all the hair care advice I read. I am currently using [HairStory](https://www.hairstory.com/products/new-wash/) and it is going alright, but that s\\*&t is expensive. I made the mistake of using a leave-in that came in an Ipsy bag ( [FoxyBae Magic Daily Leave In Hair Mask - 12-in-1](https://www.foxybae.com/products/12-in-1-magic-daily-leave-in-hair-mask)). It was good the first time I used it but now my hair is feeling a bit grubby (so I guess I need to use a clarifying shampoo). I like to wash my hair ever other day, but on day two I always have to wear it in a ponytail. I'm tired of fighting it every day and spending a fortune on stuff that never seems to work. \n\nI have tried CG method, untold products for decades, products for curly hair, products for wavy hair, products for fine hair...). If I don't wash my hair frequently my scalp itches, so I have never managed more than three days. It takes my hair a long time to air dry, so I hate washing it because I have to go to work with wet hair or sleep with wet hair. \n\nI just want my hair to be moisture/protein balanced and not weighed down. I don't like complicated hair routines and prefer to use little or no product outside of shampoo and conditioner. I occasionally use [L'anza Bounce Up Spray](https://www.ulta.com/healing-oil-bounce-up-spray?productId=xlsImpprod18041073) and that seems to be magic. I have [Olaplex](https://olaplex.com/) 3 and it worked great the first time and has had diminishing returns since. I also have Olaplex 6 and it feels heavy in my hair. \n\nI tried that hair in water test and it never sunk despite leaving it in the cup for over an hour; however, I hear that this test may not be that helpful. Again, I get conflicting information. \n\nI am currently eyeing the [Verb Ghost line](https://www.verbproducts.com/products/smooth-shine-duo?variant=32294608240729). Ingredients below.

I bought one of those [shampoo brush things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZDXFL6?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) for a scalp massage while shampooing and that feels nice and I think my roots are less greasy for longer.

There are not many in the recommended products list, and adding semi-permanent dye to my conditioners, as the guide recommended worked very badly (I had color in it months later!). So I went on a search for approved conditioners and this is what I found!\n\n*My hair:* Definitely wavy and not curly, relatively fine, color-treated but weirdly protein sensitive despite that (????), naturally dry, high porosity, long. My coloration isn't dramatic - I basically go from a dark blonde to having honey-colored highlights. \n\n**Pura d'Or ColorHarmony Purple Conditioner** - This one is nicely pigmented - I can leave it on 3-5 minutes and be toned, though I usually leave it 7-10 - and moisturizing. My hair generally feels nice and soft afterwards. It has glycerin, though not high on the list; regardless it works best for me if I use it within the 30-60 dewpoint range. It has some protein, but not too much - my hair has never gotten strawlike after it as long as I moisturize adequately. I really recommend it. \n\n*Ingredients**:*  Decolorized Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice\\*, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Pyrus Malus (Apple) Fruit Extract\\*, Glycerin\\*, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol (1-Hexadecanol, 1-Octadecanol), Colocasia (Taro) Esculenta\\*, Biotin, Avena Sativa (Oat) Bran Extract\\*, Citrus Aurantium (Orange) Peel Extract\\*, Ethylhexyl Olivate, Squalane, Bambusa (Bamboo) Vulgaris\\*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil\\*, Keratin, Biotin, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Saponins, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Zinc Sulfate, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Oil\\*, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil\\*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Oil\\*, Xylityl Sesquicaprylate, Citric Acid, Ext. Violet 2 (CI 60730). \n\n**dHue Cool Blonde Conditioner -** This one is less pigmented - reports are that it doesn't tone well for certain people - and has more protein; overall I enjoy it less and find it more drying, but I have it in my arsenal because it's glycerin free and I need it for \\~30 and 60+ dewpoints. I've kind of just worked out how to use it - every 2nd or 3rd wash, leaving it in for 10 minutes, followed by a moisturizing, protein-free conditioner (so I condition twice overall *on top of* a leave-in). With that in mind, it works perfectly fine; it tones decently and my hair still looks nice. \n\n*Ingredients:*  Water/Aqua/Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Distearyldimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Silk Amino Acids, Hydrolyzed Silk, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance (Pa\u001drfum), Citric Acid, CI 60730, Acid Violet 43 (Ext. Violet 2). \n\n**Note on the Shampoos:** The shampoos associated with these conditioners have questionable ingredients for CGM and are pretty drying. I do find they're good clarifying shampoos every month or two, but wouldn't personally use them on a regular basis since my hair is already dry.\n\nHope this helps!",

I'd gotten serious about CGM over a year ago and have been pretty dedicated to SM products, because anything else is fairly hard to find in my area and DevaCurl costs way too much. I was using the SM smooth & tame shampoo (twice a week) and conditioner, a leave-in, and the coconut hibiscus curl & style milk. All products should've been ok for my curl pattern.\n\nAnyway, the stuff going down around DevaCurl got me reading up on build-up with products that are silicone-free. I fell down a rabbit hole regarding polyquats and ingredients that bind like polyquats such as Behentrimonium Chloride and Guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride. I was also getting concerned about oils building up on my hair as the ends were starting to dry out and my hair was simultaneously getting unmanageably greasy, like it did back when I had silicone build up. \n\nI decided to do a clarifying wash with a shampoo with sodium coco sulfate (because apparently that will remove polyquats): The Green Beaver Company's Volumizing Lavender shampoo. It's a Canadian \"natural\" brand that i got for cheap at Winners. Anyway, while brushing conditioner (Desert Essence Coconut) through my hair with a detangling brush, the build-up started coming off my scalp in tiny white chunks (probably hardened oils). It was very alarming. I always brush product through with a detangling wet brush before plopping and there's never been hard white chunks in it before.\n\nI used Suave Coconut Conditioner as a leave-in this time (holla, Dollarama!), along with a little aloe vera gel. I already had a hair loss scare a little while ago where it was coming out in clumps. It's growing back in, so it probably wasn't due to build-up and was probably just hormones stuff (I did see my doctor about it), but I don't want to take anymore chances, especially with DevaCurl allegedly destroying people's hair. Has anyone else had this happen to them with SheaMoisture? I loved their products so much, but I think I'm totally done with them.\n\n(Edited to add: I have also used SM's \"build up blaster\" but it clearly does not actually remove build up!)",

Back then I didn't think it helped much with my hair, but I was also using some shampoos and conditioner with protein (and cones)\n\nAs of now I'm using Aubreys Honeysuckle rose conditioner or something, the protein free one. It's not super, but it's alright. I'm willing to use the whole bottle and maybe buy again.\n\nI am also currently using Kinky Curly Knot today, but to be honest it does little to nothing for my hair. If I use just a bit too much, my hair looks really weird and dirty, and it doesn't give any bounce to my hair.\n\nI've been using Head and shoulders the past three weeks as I think I might have Seborrheic dermatitis. The shampoo is drying my hair, but my scalp seems pretty satisfied (less sebum build up, no irritation, and my scalp is pretty sensitive to even good brands). I will not continue to use H&S, but maybe periodically if there seems to be a sebum issue again.\n\nIdeally I would not be using much shampoo. Maybe just ACV and baking soda rinse now and then.\n\nI'm waiting for a Giovanni shampoo bought on Iherb to bring out the colour of my blonde hair, which I will be using only now and then. (It's got cones, the one called amodimethicone (supposedly a \"good\" quality cone?)\n\nI'd prefer my hair would be cone free, and I will try to keep it fairly cone light atleast. I don't mind cones much, I just hate the build up on blonde hair and feeling like I rely on cones, haha. But mainly I want to stear clear from protein.\n\n\nMy hair is btw 2a/2b, mousey blonde during winters, thick and extremely coarse, and also very frizzy.\n\nThese are the ingredients in the KMS Tame Frizz creme. Can anyone tell me if there are any sort of proteins in it? I will try to only use a small amount of this just to see how my hair will respond now that I don't use the same shampoo/conditioner as I did last summer.\n\nWater / Aqua / Eau, Cetearyl Alcohol, Isopropyl Palmitate, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetyl Acetate, VP/VA Copolymer, Isopropyl Myristate, Sorbitan Oleate, Lanolin Alcohol, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Behentrimonium Chloride, Butyl Stearate, Lanolin Oil, Chitosan, Glycerin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Caryocar Brasiliense Fruit Oil, Acacia Seyal Gum Extract, Silicone Quaternium-22, Oleyl Acetate, Acetylated Lanolin Alcohol, Glycyl Glycine, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Acetamide MEA, Stearyl Acetate, Propylene Glycol, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Dipropylene Glycol, Polyquaternium-11, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tetrasodium EDTA, PPG-3 Myristyl Ether, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance / Parfum.",

I don't heat style it or use styling products, and I always brush it before getting in the shower. \n\nI think the conditioner is primarily to blame, as the tangling doesn't happen until I apply it, but I did also get the shampoo from that line.

    "body": "I've worn my ring for more than 2 years while doing dishes, taking a shower, cleaning the house with various cleaners.....  I don't use much for caustic cleaners or things that leave a lot of residue due to the number of pets we have so I rarely have to worry about damaging the ring and only occasionally take it off first.\n\nSomehow while giving the fluffy husky a bath I rather severely burnt my finger.  I don't have anything that can focus well enough to take a pic and my husband has not been interested in helping with his amazing quality phone camera.  The dog shampoo had not arrived yet so I used plain unscented dawn dish soap to get the worst dirt off and then human moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  The problem happened before I applied the new dog specific after bath coat conditioner for helping her excess fluff slide out and that was a spray I didn't really get on myself so everything I used was the same as I have repeatedly in other situations.  \n\n\nInitially I thought the flexible plastic brush with it's hand strap and finger loop were merely pushing the bulky ring into my finger.  I have very small hands and this is the widest and sharpest edged ring I've ever worn.  So I assumed despite trying to keep my finger farther back and avoid pushing on the ring the occasional times it did were the reason for the mild discomfort and red line on the back of my finger.  \n\n\nThe next morning that red line was a huge raised red welt in a strip as wide a the ring with larger areas that matched the spacing of the electrodes.  I decided it was most definitely not just from the ring digging in.  I moved my ring to my other hand.  It's continued to work as normal.  By evening I had 3 large blisters that broke and scabbed over.  While those healed during the next several days little itchy blisters appeared along the edges of the still large raised red welt across the back of my finger.  I heal fast so it was slightly concerning that this wound showed practically no sign of improving.  \n\n\nFinally over a week later new blisters stopped forming, the raised area suddenly went down practically overnight, and the damaged skin is peeling off.  I've always had a tendency to find ways to burn myself while cooking, fireworks(even sparklers), and once I melted some fine copper wire strands to the side of my finger in a rewiring oopsy on a low voltage device.  I'm pretty sure I have never managed to get a burn this severe.    \n\n\nUnfortunately I can't really tell you what the catalyst was given I've used all the same products in other situations and rinsed each one off thoroughly before the next.  The only unique thing in this incident was dog fur.  Doing dishes for hours, taking long showers with soaps, scrubbing the dogs with dry shampoo spray or wipes, wiping off the kitchen counters with mild chlorine based disinfectant (not at all similar to bleach), dusting with pledge, and mopping the floor with an oura ring on has not resulted in any problems.    \n\n\nMaybe soap covered dog fur can short out an oura ring?  Don't know but of all the things you do while wearing an oura ring apparently don't wash the dog. :P   \n\n\n  \n\n\nShampoo and conditioner used:  \n OGX coconut milk nourishing shampoo- Active Ingredients: Aqua (Water); Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate;  Cocamidopropyl Betaine; Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine; Parfum; Glycol  Distearate; Dimethicone Copolyol; Cetyl Alcohol; Cocamide DEA; Guar  Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride; Polyquaternium-11; DMDM Hydantoin;  Panthenol; Silk Amino Acids; Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract; Albumen;  Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil; Hydrolyzed Milk Protein; Tocopheryl  Acetate (Vitamin E); Coumarin \n\n&#x200B;\n\nogx coconut milk conditioner- Water (Aqua), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride,  Glycerin, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit  Extract, Glycol Stearate, Glycol Distearate, Ceteareth-20, Isopropyl  Alcohol, Dimethicone, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Citric Acid,  Cyclopentasiloxane, Panthenol, Ovum (Egg Powder), Propylene Glycol,  Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone, Fragrance (Parfum).",

Perhaps, in my sleep, the sensors twisted toward the top of my finger where the delicate skin is as opposed to staying positioned underneath on the palm side my hand.\n\n I seem to recall when I initially received the ring that the literature stated to keep the sensors on the under side of your hand. Is that because they know it has the potential to burn the sensitive skin on the top of your hand?\n\nThis is unfortunate. I love my ring.",

    "body": "Hey, so I'm a male in my early 30s and I've only just started getting into skincare. I've been at it for a month. I know this isn't long but my results so far have been a little discouraging. The people I ask tell me that maybe it's a lack of sleep, a bad diet, lack of water, or that I need to see a derma.\n\nI want to believe it's purging but it could be the products I use. My plan is to stick to it for another month and then maybe start from scratch with the basics (cleanser, moisturiser) and slowly introduce the serums and acids and stuff afterwards. Yes, I know, that's how I should've started. But I figured I could start it all at once.\n\nThe frustrating part is that my skin seemed to be better before I even was using any products. Again, I hope this is just purging. So, here's my routine. I recently was able to acquire a sample of Vitamin C from a friend. Another friend was telling me that I should find something to \"dry out\" my face, like tea tree, or a physical exfoliator to address whiteheads... that my AHA/BHA peel might not be enough since it's chemical. Anyway, here it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n AM  \n‚Ä¢ SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n‚Ä¢ Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Buffet  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%   \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n‚Ä¢ Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++  \n\n\nAM (Vitamin C) - Just started on this  \n‚Ä¢ SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n‚Ä¢ Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n‚Ä¢ Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Serum  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n‚Ä¢ Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence SPF 50 PA ++++  \n\n\nPM - I only retinoid when I feel like I can take it; new to it, maybe used it a total of three times over a month  \n‚Ä¢ SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n‚Ä¢ Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Buffet  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha  \n\n\nPM (exfoliation) - Also only use when I feel my face can take it, might've used 3-4 times the whole month.  \n‚Ä¢ SNAILWHITE Whipp Soap  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution  \n‚Ä¢ Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Hyaluronic Acid Lotion  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%  \n‚Ä¢ The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + Ha \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I really did my research before getting all this stuff and I was virtually living on INCIdecoder trying to cover all the bases in terms of superstar actives. My skin is combination/normal to oily. I'll textbox all the ingredients which you can plug into INCIdecoder if that helps. Is the bottom line that I should just keep on at it and hope for the best, do all the rest of it in terms of diet and sleep and so on or is there something glaringly wrong about my regimen?\n\nAm I using too many products? I'm kind of like half-way through the niac. and the peptides, I realised I was applying too much... wild guess, but could the moisturiser be locking that in and causing adverse reactions? I actually stopped using sunflower oil for this reason, I felt like my face was simply too oily and it was inappropriate for my skin type.\n\nAnyway, thanks for any input you might have.

    "body": "\nHello everyone,\n\nI have been a member of the club for almost 3 days. I have a few trivial questions:\n\n(1) my salon told me to wash my (lace) system every 3 days. To maximise service life, is it really necessary to wash the system every three days or is it better to wash it more frequently or less frequently?\nI was given the following two products for washing the system.\n\nA) Nourishing special shampoo for a healthy hair system - every time when washing.\nFor strong hair with a high proportion of nourishing ingredients. The nourishing ingredients loosen tangles and gently cleanse the hair system.  The shampoo provides your real hair with natural nutrients that are otherwise absorbed via the scalp and are therefore not found in standard shampoos.gentle cleansing for the hair and hair structure. \n\nIngredients: \nAqua, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Glycol Distearate, Sodium Chloride, Argania Spinosa Oil, 1,2,3-Propantriol, Laureth-4, Polyquaternium-10, Sodium Benzoate, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate, Citric Acid, Parfum.\n\nB) Intensive treatment - At least once a week\n\nDissolves tangles and maximises the life of the hair system and strengthens the real hair and gives it a natural fullness.\n\nIngredients: \nAqua, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetrimonium Chloride, 1,2,3 Propantriol, Argania Spinosa Oil, Panthenol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil, Camelia Sinensis Extract, Chondrus Crispus Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Allantoin, Urea, Sodium Lactate, Propylene Glycol, Lactic Acid, TEA-Lactate, Serine, Sorbitol, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Parfum\n\n(2) i sleep with my system on a silk pillow. Is a silk bonnet recommended to extend the life of the system? Any other advantages? Are there any disadvantages (such as greater risk of sweating) ? Any recommendations for one on amazon that is cheap and good quality? \n\n(3) If you spend hours in the sun, it is advisable to wear a cap to prevent the system from bleaching out with time. Is there anything to consider when putting on caps or helmets (e.g. bicycle or ski helmets)? Is the pressure on the system a problem? Can you damage it or anything? \n\n(4)Last and maybe a ridiculous question on top :-): How do you dress? putting clothes over head on back to front to minimise the risk of it coming off.\n\nThank you very much and have a nice day ",

        "body": "You may well get a variety of responses here, so I will just share what works for me. \n\n1. I only shampoo and condition once a week, and that is also when I take my system off to do maintenance and re-install. I could go longer for sure, but I enjoy my weekly routine and find it works better for my scalp and is nicely hygienic. When I started out with a salon they wanted me in every 4 weeks, which seems really gross to me now in comparison.\n\nI use leave in conditioner pretty much daily, and Argan oil probably every 2-3 days. Always after I‚Äôve sprayed the hair with water. I do use a ‚Äúcontinuous spray‚Äù bottle which makes a big difference. I do this more by feel than schedule at this point. I might rinse my system in the shower during the week (water only) if I think I need to (eg dusty yard work, etc), but if the hair feels good I leave it alone. I will occasionally use a deeper conditioner (on my weekly maintenance) with an older system that is not bouncing back as well. This will start to happen over time. \n\n2. I use a silk pillow case. I wore a silk bonnet for a long time as well, but I actually found that to be detrimental to my lace system. Probably totally fine for poly, but I found that I had more hairs getting embedded in the wrong side of my system when I wore the bonnet. My theory is that it compacts the hair too much. I don‚Äôt think I have noticed a single hair shed with just a silk pillow case, so I am sticking with that strategy. \n\n3. I wear a hat in the sun. Some of the leave ins have a sunscreen built in, but these systems are heavily treated so the sun is the enemy. You can get a lot of colour change in a hurry with sun exposure, and trying to correct the colour (despite there being a million products to do that with) is a major pain. I go with the hat if it‚Äôs sunny, and I try to avoid anything too tight on the front hairline. It‚Äôs not that it will damage your system, but the headband gets hot and sweaty so if that is in direct contact with your hairline you could create a sticky mess. \n\n4. Dress like a normal person. Lol. Putting on a shirt is not going to do anything. I mean, don‚Äôt go out of your way to create friction with your hairline but I‚Äôve never had an issue with that personally. \n\nGood luck with your hair journey!",

        "body": "Hello,\n\nPersonally (and according to advice from the salon and people here), I only use shampoo + conditioner once a week. Since my hair (on the sides, in the back) tends to have dandruff, I have to wash it every 4-5 days. As I can't simply wet + wash this part, I wet the whole head, and only use conditioner on the system.\n\nTo sleep, at first I bought satin bonnets. Then I invested in a silk pillowcase (it's pretty expensive if it's silk, so you have to be careful not to be fooled). I like bonnets because they tend to cover my eyes and help me stay asleep. The big advantage is that it keeps the hairstyle in place.  It's happened to me several times that, after a trip to the hairdresser, I don't really need to style my hair in the morning thanks to the cap (of course, it all depends on your hairstyle).\n\nI kept my system for 8 months (it could have been a bit longer, but I didn't want to come back with more hair density overnight).\n\nThe sun bleached my hair, but nothing abnormal (it has the same effect as for everyone else: in summer, your hair gets lighter). \n\nI dress in such a way as not to mess up my hair, so there's no risk of it coming unstuc haha.",

The only difference I could spot as that these conditioners use [Cetrimonium Chloride](https://www.makingcosmetics.com/Cetrimonium-Chloride_p_688.html) instead of Behentrimonium Chloride, but the only difference between those two conditioning agents is that the latter can still be felt on the hair once rinsed.",

Cetrimonium Chloride is also a surfactant.  Surfactants break the surface tension of liquids, and this is what makes it a good emulsifier... and gentle cleanser.  When properly massaged into your scalp, it picks up the excess oils and dirt in your hair and allows it to be rinsed right out with water.\n\nIt's the same concept as Pond's cold cream or micellar water to remove makeup.  These oil based cleansers dissolve the oils from your makeup and skin leaving you with a clean, moisturized face.  Cowashing removes the excess oils from your skin and hair products leaving the scalp clean but moisturized.",

    "body": "Hi!\n\nI was looking into changing my hair care routine. Although I have had moderate success in defining my curls and creating some volume, I still feel that my hair is too frizzy and not as shiny as I would like it to be (pics [here](https://imgur.com/a/hob4ids)).\n\nAdditionally, if possible, I would like it to feel \"lighter\" and with more movement, as I feel that I can only really style it when I get it wet.\n\nCurrently, I do daily co-washing with the TRESemm√© rich moisture conditioner, as (i) I feel that I can only style my hair when I get it wet, and (ii) if I only wet it without applying conditioner, I feel that my hair gets easily tangled. For styling, I use the Keune Style Curl Cream after removing excess moisture from my hair after the shower, and then air dry it.\n\n**TRESemm√© Rich Moisture Conditioner**\n\n>WATER (AQUA), CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DIMETHICONE, STEARAMIDOPROPYL DIMETHYLAMINE, BEHENTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, ASCORBIC ACID, PANTHENOL, BIOTIN, NIACINAMIDE, FRAGRANCE (PARFUM), DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, LACTIC ACID, AMODIMETHICONE, SODIUM CHLORIDE, DISODIUM EDTA, PEG-7 PROPYLHEPTYL ETHER, CETRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, AMYL CINNAMAL, LIMONENE, LINALOOL\n\n**Keune STYLE Curl Cream N¬∞25**\n\n>Aqua (Water), Dimethicone, PVP, Propylene Glycol, Sorbitol, Trisiloxane, Phenoxyethanol, Polyacrylamide, Phenyl Trimethicone, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Amodimethicone, Dimethiconol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-90M, Dipropylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Panthenol, Laureth-7, Methylparaben, Parfum (Fragrance), Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein PG-Propyl Silanetriol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Propylparaben, Benzoic Acid, Potassium Sorbate.",
